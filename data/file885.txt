8850004 persepsi publik kepindahan ke emirates membuat kas klub banyak terkuras kami harus mampu membayar kembali dana pinjaman yang dibutuhkan untuk membangun stadion
8850005 tengoklah laporan neraca keuangan kami anda bisa melihat jika pembayaran utang stadion hanya mencapai 20 juta pound sementara revenue klub sejak pindah ke emirates terus meningkat dan kini hampir mencapai 50 juta pound jadi darimana asumsi perpindahan stadion menyebabkan kas klub terkuras jika ternyata kepindahan itu justru membuat klub memiliki dana tambahan sekitar 30 juta pound per tahunnya
8850006 jika arsene wenger meminta kepada kami manajemen klub untuk menyediakan dana transfer sebesar 30 juta pound rp 510 miliar untuk membeli seorang pemain tentu saja kami bakal menyediakannya seketika itu juga

8850009 its all a bit ridiculous there is no connection with the murder case
8850010 we acknowledge that the title of kimberley chambers book and the timing of the publication of si n jenkins book were significant to the decision to cancel the event
8850011 the business plan was absolutely unbelievable and the connection from grassroots hockey in this province hockey alberta the western hockey league to the two nhl teams was as good as weve ever seen
8850012 it will be the first time that every player in this event will get to play in an nhl arena and that is special for european players as well as canadian players
8850013 well definitely have a schedule where the canadian team will have to stay in one arena for the regular games and the finals will be in the other
8850014 weve worked that through pretty well with the committee already and we feel very confident that both sites are going to be well looked after from the canadian side
8850015 weve looked at pricing and weve looked at demographics and we said you know what edmonton can make this work with canada in their pool
8850016 and the medal games can go to calgary because of scheduling and a bunch of other variables and there was never a bone of contention between us
8850017 this is more than a sponsorship this is an investment in the no 1 sport in nova scotia
8850018 this will assure more nova scotians will find their way to the podium
8850019 right after we get out of nationals the lake level will go down a few feet to allow for that work
8850020 the facilities around the course will also begin upgrades theres a lot of work to do in partnership with the city and the canoeing community
8850021 aliant has really embraced the sport its our top performing sport in world championships and summer olympic events were very proud of that and many of those athletes come from atlantic canada
8850022 switching credit cards used to be commonplace and being a rate tart was seen as a sign of being savvy with your cash but getting a credit card is much more difficult now
8850023 unless youve paid off your debts you could be stung with very high interest rates on your remaining balance once your zero per cent deal ends
8850024 the days of the rate tart are numbered as the effects of the credit crunch filter into the credit card system with balance transfer fees now the norm and with banks being much more stringent with who they lend to most people will have to accept that having a credit card does not mean having free money the number one rule is only borrow what you can afford to repay
8850025 while the pace of monthly falls picked up during the month the less volatile three month on three month measure eased very slightly in august to 4 5 from 4 6 in july
8850026 recent activity levels in the housing market have been very subdued
8850027 estate agents data across all property types is a little more optimistic and suggests that there may be some glimmers of interest returning to the market
8850028 there is clearly less mortgage borrowing taking place in the current market but those borrowers choosing a new loan are tending to opt for fixed rate loans even though they have been more expensive than trackers
8850029 tracker loans have been cheaper than fixed rate loans since october 2007 but in spite of that the proportion of borrowers choosing a fixed rate loan has been increasing
8850030 in addition among the fixed rate loans available borrowers seem to be keeping true to their word and opting for longer term fixed rate loans
8850031 as the miles review states there are benefits to borrowers from taking out longer term fixed rate loans as they insulate them from the impact of unexpected changes in interest rates
8850032 up until july last year the sub prime market was a growing sector offering 8 148 sub prime residential mortgage products compared with just 1 252 today
8850033 many lenders realised that there was an ever increasing number of people with blemishes on their credit files existing lenders added sub prime products to their range and there was an influx on new lenders offering exclusively sub prime mortgages
8850034 as a result of the much publicised difficulties in funding this type of lending the number of lenders offering such products has dropped from 36 in july 2007 to just 13 today
8850035 last year the market for sub prime was so competitive that some rates being offered were only fractionally higher than standard residential rates
8850036 many borrowers on a light level of sub prime assumed that if they kept on top of their financial affairs once their deal ended they would be able to move to a much cheaper standard residential deal but due to stricter lending criteria from prime lenders this isnt necessarily the case
8850037 if they can get a standard residential deal their new repayments could potentially drop as a better deal currently available on a two year fixed stands at 5 54
8850038 of those that cant get a new standard residential deal they will need to try and find a new sub prime deal or have no alternative other than moving onto the revert to rate of their existing deal with this rate currently standing at 9 43 this could prove costly
8850039 south africas high commissioner in uganda henry chiliza has confirmed the departure of two south africans from uganda who were detained in kampala two weeks ago
8850040 they are on a flight and i have a spring in my step
8850041 they sounded great they sounded grateful to allah and we are just happy they are on their way home and we are happy to receive them
8850042 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8850043 we believe that the department for work and pensions should support adults who become carers during their working lives to combine work and care and enable those who wish to return to paid work when caring ends or changes to do so
8850044 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8850045 in terms of lending the main area of focus remains buy to let where tenant demand remains strong and rents are rising however we plan to reduce mortgage volumes in the second half and into 2009 until more favourable economic conditions return
8850046 we have commissioned kpmg to do a report on the equestrian shooting and basketball venues looking at whether the olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money
8850047 when you take the costs for these venues it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people
8850048 after numerous discussions around the league we officially released marcus this afternoon
8850049 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act
8850050 we did everything humanly possible to trade marcus which would have allowed him to play under the conditions of his contract with us unfortunately we werent able to make that happen
8850051 i hope it happens because it means that i at least caught a pass and contributed in some form or fashion
8850052 it means ive been surrounded by phenomenal teammates who have allowed me to get open and do my job its a neat little thing but if we win the game then ill be ecstatic its an absolutely critical game and at this stage of my career ive finally realized that wins are more important than individual statistics
8850053 it kind of hurt him that he missed most of camp and the first couple of games of the season with a leg injury
8850054 its no secret that hes not the fastest receiver on our team and we have guys that get open deep
8850055 his thing is to get open underneath but there are times were going to throw downfield there are plays designed for him the coaches know he can get open underneath
8850056 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
8850057 heavy tilt toward big oil companies reflects the influence of exxon mobil and other oil companies on policy makers in washington dc
8850058 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
8850059 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8850060 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom will you vote
8850061 si nous maintenons le rythme des arrestations de ces deux derni res ann es la capture de mladic ne devrait pas tarder
8850062 il est dans lint r t du g n ral mladic et de tous quil se rende au plus vite
8850063 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8850064 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8850065 le v hicule na pas pu p n trer dans le camp il a explos quand les services de s curit ont ouvert le feu
8850066 it seems like every paper managed to catch that shot
8850067 i just say i went as hard as i could sorry that i didnt look pretty afterwards get off my back
8850068 it got kind of weird driving by billboards of myself and seeing the commercials
8850069 people are coming up and singing the believe song to me
8850070 the first time it really began to set in that i was there was when we were walking through the tunnel into the stadium and the entire team began singing o canada and all of a sudden we came out into the birds nest stadium and 90 000 people were screaming
8850071 when the olympic torch was lit up i almost froze for a second i was just in awe it made everything seem so real and so exciting
8850072 for me i felt like we had the best races weve ever had
8850073 it was a big step from last year where we were disappointed at not making the finals at the worlds it was a thrill to be able to race against the best with medals in sight it was really cool
8850074 toutefois avec le temps jai aussi appris aimer habiller les femmes qui peut tre n taient pas aussi belles mais qui avaient quelque chose de plus que la beaut

8850076 in front of 84 000 people the estimated amount one of the biggest conventions in history the highlights of his speeches included cutting taxes for all american working families ending the war in iraq and putting a stop to americas addiction on oil
8850077 being in the center i honestly felt like i was watching history unfold
8850078 there is no doubt in my mind that each and every hillary and bill clinton loyalists will be true democrats at the end of the day
8850079 i spoke to this lady from kansas city and she has been to conventions for the last 40 years she has been a die hard clinton supporter and she said there is no doubt in her mind that barack will get her vote
8850080 but a wins a win we would have liked to do a lot of things better defensively than we did we are in no way satisfied we have to do a lot of things better
8850081 i was trying to make a play for the team but unfortunately it didnt work out that way
8850082 it didnt happen i have to learn from this and try to make better decisions
8850083 it feels like i didnt play football in two years
8850084 it feels good to be out there i picked up where i left off now just keep it going
8850085 the temperature of key equipment above its suggested operating range
8850086 to california please i have wildfires to prevent and step on it
8850087 step on it i got to get to work the zoo opens at nine am
8850088 the first half of 2008 was a difficult period for newstar
8850089 the tradingenvironment remains difficult and we do not expect conditions toimprove in the immediate future
8850090 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8850091 we work exceptionally hard to minimize any collateral damage zero collateral damage is the goal
8850092 im encouraged that hes taken action and i also think its going to take some time
8850093 the bottom line is that to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked
8850094 amyloid beta measurements in the brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well the cells are communicating with each other
8850095 hamas just wants to show theyre different from the palestinian government to pretend that they are the real government here
8850096 youre going to have a whole hell of a lot of me because im coming home
8850097 theres a lot of people i should recognize because as they say you brung me up
8850098 if i hear by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8850099 philadelphia is a good city in which to write american history
8850100 this is fitting ground on which to reaffirm the faith of our fathers to pledge ourselves to restore to the people a wider freedom to give to 1936 as the founders gave to 1776 an american way of life
8850101 clouds of suspicion tides of ill will and intolerance gather darkly in many places
8850102 a mysterious cycle in human events to some generations much is given of other generations much is expected this generation of americans has a rendezvous with destiny
8850103 we dont have the same kind of economic crisis as in the great depression
8850104 but we have a serious banking and financial crisis we have a war whether youre for it or against it that has gone on for five years longer than the second world war and you have a hunger for leadership
8850105 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8850106 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system
8850107 its not worth putting your life at risk if you have the means to get out
8850108 we hope this will refute all the rumors that say the american companies are the only ones benefiting from the american occupation
8850109 this action shows that every iraqi faces arrest and detention without any reason
8850110 from now i will say that the ball is in malaysias hand so they are the ones who have to decide whether this deal cango on or not our stance remains the same
8850111 there are things that they maybank have to take care of but thats their business with bank negara malaysia so i thinkthe ball is in bank negara malaysias hand
8850112 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8850113 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8850114 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8850115 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8850116 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe
8850117 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8850118 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8850119 they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values
8850120 and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8850121 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8850122 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8850123 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8850124 its very very important that we play the way we practiced and trained over the last year and a half
8850125 and we cant afford to be in a disorganized way as we confront the challenges that were going to see here
8850126 our whole goal is to turn the 75 000 people here in this stadium into grassroots volunteers
8850127 this is all about neighbors talking to neighbors family members talking to family members
8850128 bewerber und bewerberinnen aus wermelskirchen k rten und odenthal hatten in diesem jahr trotz zahlreicher bewerbungen leider weniger gl ck
8850129 das wird sich im n chsten jahr aber hoffentlich wieder ndern
8850130 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8850131 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8850132 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8850133 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8850134 everything looks good but i think its like that for every team everybodys always thinking that they like their team when theyre starting training camp
8850135 but we have 50 guys coming tomorrow friday and i asked my veterans to be in really good shape so i hope there are no bad surprises there and for the rookies they have two days to show me they deserve the chance to play against halifax on sunday
8850136 theres no wake up time for the guys this year
8850137 things are going to happen really fast thats why we have all of our scouting staff around to help us make the best decisions we want to know as much as possible about all our players because we dont have time to watch them forever
8850138 for example if a guys conditioning is not there we cant wait for him thats the advantage the vets have we know what they can do on the ice and we know what they can bring to the team but if theyre not in shape i dont have time for conditioning if a guys not in shape im going to take a rookie whos ready and whos going to work hard
8850139 i have been talking with a lot of gms but the first thing i want to do is see how some of our veteran guys come back after the summer and i also want to see what our rookies can do
8850140 right now for me friday and saturday are big evaluation days but then im going to be on the phone sunday for trades
8850141 we have three guys going to pro camps so we might not do anything until we know for sure who is coming back we know alex and murdock are here for sure but bob slaney is not leaving until september 19th and the other two guys are leaving on the 12th
8850142 i would like to find a place to play for our guys we cant keep but we might need to wait as late as possible because youre never sure what can happen with cully haddad and bob slaney they might impress a team and sign to play in the american hockey league but you dont know that until they go there
8850143 we never know with the euros but hes been here since monday and jan piskacek will be here next week hes got training camp with the czech world junior team so he will be in town on tuesday all our guys will be here and were very pleased about that
8850144 obviously if you would ask me at the moment if im playing like a no 1 probably not
8850145 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8850146 i was thinking am i really made to play tennis
8850147 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots
8850148 many times they play matches of their life not only in womens tennis also in mens
8850149 i dont care about the first two games this one hurt
8850150 we played our hearts out we lost a really tough game
8850151 its sad to see it go but i think itll be fun to move to the new stadium
8850152 the caddy topos sail design concept based on the smallest model in the volkswagen commercial vehicle van range uses design cues from classic yachts and has its multi functional roof covered with wooden decking surrounded by aluminium roof rails
8850153 whilst our continual investment in prices and customerloyalty resulted in increased sales volumes our cost controlpolicy has enabled us to enhance profitability
8850154 we will maintain our focus on efficiency and our key taskfor the rest of the year is to ensure smooth integration ofkarusel and improvement of its operational and financialperformance
8850155 certainly thats our goal to have a successful resolutionby the end of 2008
8850156 to bring continuity to the doj discussions rod parry ournewly appointed chairman will be taking over the day to daymanagement of the doj process freeing me up and allowing me tofocus my efforts on daily operations
8850157 the blue chips have come down a long way and are probablystarting to represent better value the land securities land l quote profile research stock buzz and the british land blnd l quote profile research stock buzz of this world
8850158 the two big ones have got a broad spread of high qualityassets
8850159 the q2 gdp numbers were driven by net exports and ofcourse were good but we need to see how and when housing marketsstabilise
8850160 the eurozone inflation numbers should moderate and shouldbe even lower in september and beyond due the impact of loweroil and the base effect
8850161 obviously the last two games ive thrown the ball pretty good ive changed the pace of the ball thrown it over the plate kept them off balance
8850162 today he did the same thing he did the last time out he attacked the strike zone with his fastball he went to his off speed stuff when he needed to he was really good and thats the kind of guy i like to see out there
8850163 as efficient as i was today im looking at eight innings or possibly a complete game
8850164 the two to wigginton i thought were my only mistakes
8850165 i pretty much put the ball right where i wanted to
8850166 i get to run out on an nfl field in front of my family and everyone im just going to live it up and see what happens
8850167 i dont have the luxury of sitting back with my shoulder pads off
8850168 college was the last time i really got to play the whole game
8850169 ive been thinking to myself ive had a good camp yeah but its not over i want to prove to myself that i can be a viable receiver on this team
8850170 some guys will make it or break it in that game
8850171 but for the most part you know your team right now
8850172 i think some teams that are really deep right now there is value to this game for them because theyve got a number of guys theyre thinking can make the roster hopefully well be there some day
8850173 said leslie pierce and catching her husbands eye began to laugh as he chimed in
8850174 they taught me how to carry myself the value of a firm handshake how to look someone in the eye when you speak to them
8850175 we had a roof over our head we each had a bed and we had clothes to wear to church every sunday
8850176 i remember white people standing on the corners spitting and foaming at the mouth
8850177 but most things that influenced you as a child you carry through life
8850178 we had just brought in groceries from the pantry pride on stenton avenue my mother was putting the bags on the counter when i heard the news
8850179 and i remember the skies lighting up on columbia avenue during the riots
8850180 and the day after he was shot i huddled in a corner at school i was afraid that something might happen to us
8850181 every single day ive always had to work at this level
8850182 ninety nine percent of the time i feel im guarding my color now this man this black man is getting ready to accept the nomination to be president of the united states if he coughs wrong theyre going to scrutinize every thing he does
8850183 you sit in class and hear about the ways blacks were treated you read about it and watch documentaries like eyes on the prize then you fast forward 45 years to today with a black man running for president and wonder is this the same country with the fire hoses and dogs attacking blacks who were taking a nonviolent approach to civil rights
8850184 but seeing where obama is shows that america has grown peoples minds are open to something new
8850185 has the potential to end widespread hunger in drought prone areas of sub saharan africa
8850186 land degradation is particularly acute in sub saharan africa where the soil has been overused coupled with low unpredictable rainfall
8850187 with microdosing they dont invest much and that reduces their risk
8850188 reports indicate that land degradation affects more than half of sub saharan africa leading to loss of an estimated 42 billion dollars in income and five million hectares 12 5 million acres of productive land each year
8850189 thousands of successful experiments across the dryland areas of west and southern africa demonstrate that microdosing can boost yields enough to eliminate the need for food aid
8850190 las cr ticas son leg timas lo que no es leg timo es poner bombas
8850191 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
8850192 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
8850193 i dont think that things like that happen for no reason
8850194 i think that everything has a purpose even the bad things the good things that happen to you
8850195 even though i hated it at the same time i was also learning
8850196 being able to sit on the sidelines and see my team play id see mistakes my teammates would be making and i used to make those same things
8850197 she and megan wilson are on the left side and usually your left side hitters are kind of your go to hitters and they carry the bulk of the offensive burden on their shoulders
8850198 so shell step in there and shell have to swing at a lot of balls
8850199 i think a lot of times a big mistake that even i can make is taking volleyball outside of the hearnes center and outside of the athletic complex
8850200 because i think that when youre making that separate distinction you have a good balance but when youre taking it everywhere else you just get so caught up in it that can lead to frustration and it all carries onto the court
8850201 as a freshman they require you to do so many hours of study hall per week
8850202 and as a freshman you obviously hate that its inconvenient you have to go over there on their set times that was a really good experience for me because you spend so much time there that you dont really have a lot of time anywhere else you really want to capitalize on the time you have everywhere else to hang out with your friends and watch tv and stuff so i think that having that as a requirement that first year forced me to really organize and separate everything from my life because now i go into study hall voluntarily which not a lot of people do
8850203 mr ma would like to see and he can afford to do it access 31 continue for the benefit of the community
8850204 1 3 million would cover us to keep it operating in analogue until the funds to move us into simulcast broadcasting could be provided by the federal government
8850205 despite encouraging words from the federal government they have not provided any funds that would enable access 31 to go digital
8850206 and lotterywest verbally indicated they would inject 250 000 but then they indicated they would not be putting anything in
8850207 mirror on america how the state of gulf coast recovery reflects on us all reveals the slow pace of recovery in the region what more needs to be done to rebuild and urges the next administration to make recovery a national priority some of the key findings include more than 35 000 individuals still living in fema trailers in the gulf coast only 12 percent of african american evacuees who returned to new orleans after the hurricanes were able to find work compared with 45 percent of white evacuees in louisiana 82 000 apartments were damaged or destroyed by katrina and rita but the highest official estimate proposes to replace only about 25 000 affordable units in mississippi federal money that was mandated for use in rebuilding low income housing was instead diverted to improving the shipyards in biloxi compliance with federal labor laws has been ignored with frequent occurrences of safety and health violations wage theft and exploitative treatment of immigrant workers oxfam is urging the next administration to create an office for gulf coast recovery headed by a federal coordinator to make sure all federally subsidized housing destroyed in the storms is reopened or replaced to require states gulf coast states that receive federal recovery dollars to provide regular reports on the use of those funds and to ensure compliance with labor laws a new administration will face the challenge of correcting the mistakes of its predecessor and a critical opportunity to rebuild the gulf coast better and stronger

8850211 you cant easily get the diaspora out of the jews
8850212 despite the aspirations of zionism to create a safe haven for the worlds jews israel is hardly the safest place in the world can we blame israeli parents for wanting their children to have another option an insurance policy

8850220 you only get a brief glimpse of sunlight before its cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains i would like to test myself in another top league at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities its not only the weather in peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel joy throughout the week they work hard they only talk to people at lunch then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8850221 if an area is more socially cohesive it increases your chances of having good quality of interpersonal relationships and a good social network
8850222 to what extent we can talk about happy people or happy places is it the place or the people my guess would be its a bit of both the variance that is attributed to the place you live in is perhaps higher than our research suggests your immediate surroundings are very important in terms of happiness

8850224 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome

8850226 it is an honor to have dr benjamin and others working in the public health sector recognized among the most powerful in health care
8850227 their inclusion signifies the growing acknowledgement of the importance of bringing public health into the discussion around national priority issues such as health reform especially in such a critical presidential election year
8850228 the close evolutionary and genomic relationships of maize or corn to other grasses will take us one step closer to some new good sources of bioenergy
8850229 maize cell walls and the genes responsible for wall formation are characteristic of all grasses
8850230 maize has the same genes arranged in the same order and on the same chromosomes as the other grasses
8850231 well switch genes on and off as we identify them to see what they do once we know the genes and their functions then we can assess which ones might make good targets for modification for enhanced biomass and sugars for processing into biofuel
8850232 the cap prides itself on providing pathologists with the highest caliber of timely practical continuing medical education therefore recognition of our efforts by an external accrediting body is most encouraging

8850237 government agencies from local louisiana parishes to the white house reported that that new orleans levees
8850238 ive gotten reports this morning that there is already water coming over some of the levee systems in the lower ninth ward weve had one of our pumping stations to stop operating so we will have significant flooding it is just a matter of how much
8850239 flooding is significant throughout the region and a levee in new orleans has reportedly been breached sending 6 8 feet of water throughout the 9th ward area of the city
8850240 this is to put it mildly the big one i think
8850241 this is a category 5 hurricane very similar to hurricane andrew in the maximum intensity but theres a big big difference this hurricane is much larger than andrew ever was i also want to make absolutely clear to everyone that the greatest potential for large loss of lives is still in the coastal areas from the storm surge i dont think anyone can tell you with any confidence right now whether the levees will be topped or not but theres obviously a very very grave concern
8850242 i spoke to mike chertoff today hes the head of the department of homeland security i knew people would want me to discuss this issue immigration so we got us an airplane on a telephone on air force one so i called him i said are you working with the governor he said you bet we are
8850243 browns memo to chertoff described katrina as this near catastrophic event but otherwise lacked any urgent language
8850244 a large section of the vital 17th street canal levee where it connects to the brand new hurricane proof old hammond highway bridge gave way late monday morning in bucktown after katrinas fiercest winds were well north

8850249 this a historic event barack obama being the first african american presidential candidate
8850250 i want them to understand how important it is to vote not just as african americans but as women and how hard we fought to have a vote
8850251 and also for our community to go out and vote
8850252 i just wanted to be in harlem to watch the speech
8850253 we found a black guy an older gentlemen who had never voted
8850254 no one tells you you changed my mind but i think we put something in their mind about obama and we said dont be afraid
8850255 i always felt like where do i fit in and obama to me is such an interesting eclectic mix
8850256 i had to come and see him speak here it is historic
8850257 ive been texting my friends and family back home already to tell them im here and im going to call some of my older republican family members tonight when he speaks
8850258 it represents what our campaign has been about from the beginning which is this commitment to grass roots organizing and giving the average american the opportunity to get engaged in the political process
8850259 its a pretty good visual reminder of the kinds of people that sen obama believes are most important and the people who will be front and center in his own mind as he delivering this speech

8850264 such tale bearing is known in hebrew as moser informer individuals who have sunk to this lowest level of behavior were despised and shunned in jewish tradition they are considered worse than
8850265 a person who turns over a jewish person or his property to gentiles is a moser and has no part in the world to come it is permissible to execute the moser even today when there is no capital punishment it is permissible to kill the moser before he informs if he has been told not to inform and insists on informing then he who executes the moser first has great merit
8850266 the trial of capital offenses is the office of the court and it is not the duty of individuals to implement this particular halacha
8850267 between the ideology of gush emunim and the ideology of peace now
8850268 it is actually more accurate to say that the struggle is not really ideological rather its practical tactical to an astonishing degree faith based land holding vs short term motivated talebearing
8850269 as a handle in war between left and right between the jews
8850270 this kind of tale bearing to the court or to the european union and wealthy non governmental foundations across the world is called moser
8850271 the legal authorities must not stand for the phenomenon that is evidenced by alleged rabbi yisrael rozen and not allow such incitement and calls to murder

8850273 everybodys looking at cc sabathia and a j burnett not just us
8850274 well see the main concern is are their arms going to be ok after this season
8850275 its very frustrating we havent given up on this year but were definitely going to be better next year
8850276 theyre going to have to start hitting consistently no matter who theyre hitting against and especially beat the pitchers they should be beating
8850277 if anything youre starting to see the necessity of why you have to get younger weve had some injuries theres no doubt about it but weve got some key guys who havent performed like theyre capable of is that because of age
8850278 obviously as weve seen this year you cant have enough pitching
8850279 ultimately what i feel is a strong reluctance to trade three or four assets to another team for a player and then sign him to a multiyear contract you trade for a guy give up three or four assets and then pay him then youve crushed your payroll and your assets at the same time
8850280 if you choose to play in that free agent marketplace the one thing youd be sacrificing is a draft pick
8850281 were very protective of our draft picks but for the right player and the right circumstance ive always said were still big game hunters
8850282 but when we held on to a guy like that you dont do it and say ok in the next four months hes got to do x hes got five years whatever it is to show why you bet on someone like that
8850283 i dont know in what fashion or how many innings or how many pitches or what have you
8850284 well talk about september call ups i cant tell you if phil hughes is going to be here or not before the seasons out that has not been determined but he pitched much better
8850285 t d on k ll l pukorral kuid konkreetselt ei oska elda millal m ndiaare meile j uab sest veel on vaja korda ajada vajalik dokumentatsioon
8850286 all of it bottom line im the general manager so if you want we can clear this out of the way this is not a joe girardi issue
8850287 i put together a club that is where its at and im responsible for that
8850288 cut through all the red tape and stuff i think girardis done a tremendous job given what has occurred and he continues to try to remain upbeat with this coaching staff to try to keep these players up and to try to perform up to their abilities
8850289 thats frustrating for all of us but the buck stops right here with me and id say it shouldnt go any farther than that my job is to put it together my job is to fix whats broken and my job is obviously frustrating the hell out of me right now to be honest because i just believe were better than this
8850290 if i knew why i wouldve fixed it unfortunately its my job to put it together and then fix whats broke and obviously i have not been able to figure that out
8850291 i do know one thing this team is trying they are not laying down thats a fact they do care they want to win and for some reason its just not happening
8850292 id like to read them and obviously i would talk to hank about it first before i addressed it publicly
8850293 i dont care about the first two games this one hurt
8850294 we played our hearts out and lost a really tough game
8850295 were no more pessimistic about him today than we were
8850296 but when he goes out there again we want him to be able to pitch with peace of mind
8850297 guys will step up and have to pitch in and well have to count on them to do a good job
8850298 thats how we are thats why were a good team guys can step up and help out at any time
8850299 the battles that weve had the last few years it ended like it should against the red sox
8850300 weve been stale weve needed something to jump start us weve got a pulse
8850301 this one hurt we played our hearts out and lost a really tough game
8850302 i knew i was going to get some sort of opportunity late in the game
8850303 youre looking for him to pop one out of the ballpark thats what youre looking for
8850304 i was kind of excited it put some life back in the building
8850305 there wasnt much life in the building up until that point
8850306 i wonder if ive ever played on a team that scored fewer runs for the season
8850307 weve been in trouble offensively all year long its hard to understand that we have a great deal of talent but we do it hit say for two or three days and then we dont again well be on base most of the time we start rallies but most of the time we cant finish the rallies
8850308 if you line up some dominoes and ones not right it stops thats our problem weve had a hard time getting innings where we score more than one run if you pinpoint one thing its more that than anything else not getting the big hit
8850309 sometimes i think its unfair to bring it all on alex because its not all on him
8850310 we win and lose as a unit ill take the blame if you want to point the finger ill take it
8850311 but the pressure is about 10 percent and the happiness of actually being here and playing in that spot is like 90 percent
8850312 its just something ive been doing the last two years i havent played strong side since my freshman year at college
8850313 i felt comfortable and it went well it was good to be back at end
8850314 going out on the opening drive and scoring a touchdown is the way you want to start any game
8850315 it was a great job by david carr coming in and leading the offense it was a good start gives us a little momentum and a little confidence boost so were excited about starting the season
8850316 i dont have to say nothing yall do a good job with that yall do my job well i dont worry about that
8850317 no matter how we lose no matter how tough that loss is we find a way to bounce back we dont allow things to get out of control for an extended period of time
8850318 last year when things went wrong we didnt have the experience or confidence to look at it and say ok we can cut this out right now we allowed things to snowball we kept looking in the rearview mirror instead of looking ahead at what we needed to accomplish
8850319 its going to be in the back of your mind whether you like it or not
8850320 with boston every time we lost we took it to heart we did not want to look like the year before and i dont think we ever did once we had the chance to make a statement we made it in a big way i think thats what we need to do
8850321 i think we have to make that same kind of statement theres a lot of proud guys here and a lot of professionals that know and understand we can never look like that again if we lose it we lose it but not in the same way

8850330 our heartiest congratulations to capt anusha siriratne this is a significant event for the national carrier sri lanka has been in the forefront of womens empowerment and it is certainly high time that a sri lankan woman took command of an airliner
8850331 women have lagged behind in the field of aviation in sri lanka in comparison to the rest of the world even in neighbouring countries such as india women have been airline captains for many years now
8850332 it doesnt make a difference whether you are a man or a woman when flying the circumstances dont change the weather is the same and the aircraft doesnt know the difference
8850333 every pilot at srilankan is elated at this achievement we now have several more female first officers in the fleet and hope to see them in command in a few years

8850337 it is a tremendous achievement for any airline to be making money in the current aviation climate and polynesian blue is well and truly performing like a seasoned player in the global arena generating a good profit when airlines around the world are collapsing under the weight of industry challenges the ongoing success of polynesian blue is testimony to the shared vision and strategy behind the airline as well as the fantastic frontline team responsible for day to day operations

8850345 with ehtec 2008 selling out it shows how much hospitality professionals in europe need a technology conference like ehtec
8850346 there are many technology issues that are specific to europe and attendees relish the opportunity to discuss these problems and brainstorm solutions we expect ehtec 2009 to be just as packed as previous years
8850347 ehtec has quickly garnered a reputation as being a high quality education conference
8850348 the ehtec advisory council takes that reputation very seriously when it decides the important topics that the conference tackles we want attendees to take as much as they can from this experience

8850371 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio
8850372 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8850373 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8850374 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8850375 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8850376 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8850377 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives
8850378 stripped naked beaten and mistreated and that they had been subjected to too rough handling
8850379 manhandled during detention and tactical questioning the lack of significant physical injuries led him to conclude that the force used against each detainee was
8850380 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008 he said
8850381 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban he said
8850382 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8850383 where we are now is that ghra is committed to move forward to at least examining the impact of this type of activity coexisting with our

8850388 im of the view that the treasurer definitely knew about it and on the balance of probabilities the premier would have as well
8850389 this is more of a homage to the original series

8850393 kids grow up a lot faster these days and that will be reflected in the storylines were keeping it as real as we can

8850402 unfortunately society has failed to prepare many who turn to our company for help and generations are being affected by the lack of financial savvy for that reason we welcome the opportunity of working with ja to help educate young adults about the principles of money management so they can make better financial decisions were fortunate to be working closely with ja they are a passionate and dedicated group

8850408 shows that tms is a safe and effective treatment for the 7 million americans who have migraine with aura
8850409 migraine is a mechanism that is built into the human brain we all possess it and it becomes active by an efficient build up of its triggers
8850410 but once those triggers rise above the threshold migraine becomes activated and symptoms occur
8850411 the degree of symptoms depends on how high above the threshold your triggers are
8850412 the bottom line from my perspective is that its best to prevent it rather than to walk around with some expensive hardware to zap yourself every time you get an aura

8850482 lets put it this way when people buy homes and you decide youre going to have your own well at home you ought to pay some attention to that
8850483 i dont believe any state in the nation makes individual domestic well compliance with contaminant levels part of state compliance
8850484 if there are more than 50 000 homes with problem wells they could all theoretically get on the phone today real estate deals could go down this could create problems and headaches

8850491 a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8850492 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let
8850493 you are presenting defiled food upon my altar but you say how have we defiled you in that you say the table of the lord is to be despised but when you present the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and when you present the lame and sick is it not evil why not offer it to your governor would he be pleased with you or would he receive you kindly
8850494 but now will you not entreat gods favor that he may be gracious to us with such an offering on your part will he receive any of you kindly
8850495 thus they have loved to wander they have not restrained their feet therefore the lord does not accept them he will remember their iniquity now and punish their sins
8850496 do not pray for this people for their good when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering i will not accept them but i will consume them by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence jeremiah 14 10 12
8850497 but they refused to heed shrugged their shoulders and stopped their ears so that they could not hear yes they made their hearts like flint refusing to hear the law and the words which the lord of hosts had sent by his spirit through the former prophets thus great wrath came from the lord of hosts therefore it happened that just as he proclaimed and they would not hear so they called out and i would not listen
8850498 behold i will surely bring calamity on them which they will not be able to escape and though they cry out to me i will not listen to them then the cities of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they offer incense but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble for according to the number of your cities were your gods o judah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing altars to burn incense to baal so do not pray for this people or lift up a cry or prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cry out to me because of their trouble

8850511 were changing the acidity of the oceans faster than the organisms have ever experienced during their course of evolution
8850512 we were getting levels of acidification up onto the shelf in these upwelling regions that were much more dramatic than we expected to see
8850513 the reefs of the world are at risk and hawaiis isolated reefs are especially vulnerable to stresses of any kind particularly to the rapidly emerging stress brought on by climate change
8850514 ocean acidification is creeping progressive and insidious likened by one workshop participant to osteoporosis of the reef a weakening of the reef structure that makes corals more vulnerable to breakage from waves and human use
8850515 because it is difficult to detect unlike mass coral bleaching we dont know whether we have reached or surpassed the critical thresholds for any coral species such as we have for temperature thresholds
8850516 coral reefs are the lifeblood of our oceans and we depend on them for survival
8850517 without urgent action to limit carbon dioxide emissions and improve management of marine protected areas even vast treasured reefs like the great barrier reef and northwestern hawaiian islands will become wastelands of dead coral
8850518 the honolulu declaration offers tangible and practical steps we can take now to prevent further ocean acidification and ensure the survival of our vitally important and irreplaceable rainforests of the sea
8850519 we could see a doubling of atmospheric co2 in a little as 50 years and ocean acidification will continue to an extent and at rates that have not occurred for tens of millions of years
8850520 it is clear that seawater chemistry will change in coming decades and centuries in ways that will dramatically alter marine life
8850521 we are only beginning to understand the complex interactions between large scale chemistry changes and marine ecology it is vital to develop research strategies to better understand the long term vulnerabilities of sensitive marine organisms to these changes
8850522 is leading to the most dramatic changes in marine chemistry in at least the past 650 000 years
8850523 while the consequences of inaction are too depressing to contemplate there is good news
8850524 our workshop showed that there are some practical steps we can take to buy time for coral reefs while co2 levels are stabilized that there is hope for coral reefs if we act now

8850532 over the last two decades youve clearly made a substantial mark on australias legal system and indeed australias legal history
8850533 and in particular as chief justice and head of the council of chief justices youve worked to foster and strengthen judicial institutions and the sense of a national judicial identity
8850534 ultimately its not merely an attribute of judicial authority its a constitutional imperative
8850535 the challenge is to foster the judiciarys organisational resources without sacrificing the qualities theyre designed to protect and im confident this challenge will be met

8850547 john obrien died penniless and drunk in his sisters spare room and now his paintings sell for 30 000 each and are considered of value for their artistry and most of all for their representation of the age of sail in the area
8850548 the question of what is the value of an artist in society is near and dear to my heart
8850549 at one point the keels we made in nova scotia travelled all over the world my great grandfather on my mothers side was a sea captain in saint john new brunswick
8850550 he sailed all over and there is speculation he had two businesses he had a legitimate business and a business running rum up through jamaica

8850554 men are handling the grocery shopping more than ever before either on their own or shared with their spouse
8850555 men are grocery shopping more because they say it gives them time with their spouse partner or family
8850556 in contrast women are more likely to shop independently and say it gives them some time alone

8850587 even with the reduction in fuel prices over the last few weeks competitive pressure on fares and volumes will continue and we are at best expected to break even in the second half delivering a loss for the full year
8850588 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business
8850589 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling
8850590 fuel is the most significant cost within the business and the 56 5 million euro increase in our first half fuel costs contributed significantly to a loss
8850591 long haul capacity for winter 2008 09 will decline by 11 percent year on year compared to previous plans to grow by one percent and short haul capacity in the same period will decline by one percent compared to a previous expectation of two percent growth

8850593 sometimes guys need a fresh start probably like anybody else in life its weird how just really a change of scenery sometimes can get a guy going and get him his confidence
8850594 he fits well in their system he likes the guys likes the coach hes happy and content a hard working guy whos real excited he was devastated not to make the playoffs ive known him since he was 16 and never seen him as sad or upset hes got a lot to prove hes pretty fired up
8850595 its just what makes the most sense from our point of view and their point of view and they just didnt match if he has the year hes capable of having hes in line to get a good raise if not then well just go one year at a time
8850596 if there are issues from an injury point of view thats something that well have to take under consideration

8850610 what the statute has done is leave an election pretty much to the discretion of the governor general but the whole point of the statute was to essentially do away with the discretion of the prime minister to ask for one
8850611 there is no legal basis for claiming the prime minister cannot advise the governor general and no legal basis for constraining the governor general either
8850612 the matter of the advice given by the prime minister to the governor general is not something the courts generally inquire into
8850613 there could be a citizen out there who could contest this in the courts but that is problematic in the sense that it takes money and time
8850614 its not for the prime minister to decide whether or not the house of commons has confidence in him its for the house of commons to decide

8850621 i believe the building was completed at the best time when china has opened its doors to the world for 30 years and the city is going to hold the world expo soon in 2010
8850622 if you supply a good space then the demand will follow
8850623 at first it was like what are we doing walking in the middle of the street
8850624 laurie chaves 20 a student at george brown college said after strolling across with lunchtime crowds that flooded the intersection with up to 100 people at a time some filming the event with cellphone cameras
8850625 youre looking for an elmer the safety elephant to be scolding you from the side its organized chaos
8850626 it is plausible that when police are no longer here that people will cross when the red hand is flashing but that is a concern at every intersection across the city
8850627 at nighttime if theres no police here its a different corner man homeless people drunks i hate to say it but somebodys going to get hurt i hope it works but i think this is a publicity stunt for the city
8850628 its great fun its been done many other places in the world and it works there so there is no reason it shouldnt work here
8850629 with absolute due respect to our huge customer i must say that this is probably the first rfp that many of you have written in your entire careers let alone one of this value
8850630 bombardier makes a living responding to rfps of this nature around the world
8850631 i dont know how many rfps the fairness commissioner looked at or how many mfps theyve looked at
8850632 we show that when kazakhstan plays germany we fill the building
8850633 i still remember playing germany in the opening game in halifax 2003 we had everyone in red in the building when we go talk to germany about any event they still comment on that thats why we get it so often back here
8850634 there are some finances that weve been able to give back to the iihf for the growth of the game thats important globally we are making good money from this and its our responsibility to share some of that back
8850635 you know what our country is big we can do it in ottawa and then go back to saskatoon its so big and its great that all regions get to taste this great event
8850636 there is no question that we expect this tournament to break all the records
8850637 ottawa will break the current record and its going to continue to grow but when you look ahead this should set records for finances that go back to minor hockey to the canadian hockey league and more importantly to have a buzz in these buildings that weve never seen before
8850638 world vision protects and cares for the most vulnerable victims of disasters by establishing child friendly spaces in affected communities
8850639 we do think weve got a lot of relevant products that can offset the concerns that consumers do rightly have
8850640 we have a three year plan which is going to cause us to focus on building the business for the long term its our hope well build value and well be out there acting as one of the consolidators

8850660 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed
8850661 the number of democrats who support a government safety net for the poor such as guaranteeing food and shelter for the needy and spending to help them even if it means more debt jumped by 14 percentage points from 1994 to 2007
8850662 the obama nomination sets the stage for a sea change election
8850663 conservative ideas that have dominated our politics for three decades
8850664 limited by the constricted consensus of an establishment not yet able to contemplate the changes needed to set this country right again to be successful his presidency will have to be bolder and more radical than now imagined
8850665 a historic candidate the forbidding conditions and the constricted consensus make it vital that progressives think clearly and act independently in forging a strategy over the next months
8850666 these concerns should not distract us from the central reality this election features a stark ideological contrast
8850667 on national security both candidates have pledged to increase the size of the military adding billions to a bloated budget that already represents nearly half the worlds military spending
8850668 both assume americas role as globocop neither suggests unraveling the us empire of military bases both seem intent on deepening the occupation of afghanistan
8850669 neither has dared to embrace the conservative rand corporations conclusion that the very notion of a war on terror is counterproductive and that aggressive intelligence and police cooperation should be the centerpiece of our strategy
8850670 has called for a second stimulus plan focused on new energy and rebuilding america but he hasnt suggested anything like the major public initiatives
8850671 the combination of public investment revised global economic strategy industrial policy and financial regulation that would be essential to get the real economy moving again while responding to the threat of catastrophic climate change
8850672 obama has made affordable healthcare for all a centerpiece of his agenda but he has not addressed the unraveling of the private social contract once delivered through corporations and unions
8850673 he laid out promising principles for financial reform in his cooper union speech in march but he hasnt challenged the wall street bailout nor has he mobilized support for policing the shadow banking system that has proved so destructive in its greed
8850674 obama defends liberal social reforms but a serious war on poverty or an initiative to transform our brutal criminal system of injustice that is devastating the lives of young minority men is not yet on the agenda
8850675 and while obama is a former professor of constitutional law
8850676 and he may have disappointed activists with his recent compromises
8850677 m ake no mistake his election will open a new era of reform the scope of which will depend as obama often says on independent progressive mobilization to keep the pressure on and overcome entrenched interests
8850678 aggressive lobbies the military industrial complex wall street corporate interests
8850679 while democrats are likely to enjoy larger majorities in both houses their caucuses are likely to be less progressive as they pick up seats in very conservative formerly republican districts
8850680 independent of the administration or the democratic leadership in congress
8850681 mobilizing independently to support obamas promises we can organize constituent pressure on politicians who are blocking the way something even a president with obamas activist network would be loath to do
8850682 we can expose the lobbies and interests and backstage maneuvers designed to limit reforms
8850683 progressives in the senate and house many grouped around the progressive caucus
8850684 la libert vede nella religione la compagna delle sue lotte e dei suoi trionfi la culla della sua infanzia la fonte divina dei suoi diritti essa considera la religione come la salvaguardia dei costumi i costumi come la garanzia delle leggi e il pegno della sua durata
8850685 andy had a breeze in the first round and now he has had a contest maybe this was the shock he needed to go forward in this tournament
8850686 i need to sort out my house before my girlfriend gets back from holiday she is back at 10pm and the house is a mess so i need murray to take it in this set or im in trouble
8850687 i just wonder if the pressure of the situation will tell on llodra
8850688 andy is such a perfectionist and he is probably finding all this very frustrating he just has to concentrate on his own performance now and get the job done
8850689 good murray is under control again llodra has given his all i think and andy should finish him here
8850690 it has turned into an erratic match both players have had their moments but on the whole it has not been particularly pretty
8850691 murray seems to have steadied the ship a little but he is still far from looking like a number six seed
8850692 we were hoping murray would be in command by now but instead we are dead level
8850693 murray wont lose he just has to wake up and i think he is starting to get into the game now
8850694 thats the sampras way get a routine first set then introduce some drama by inexplicably capitulating in the second no wait
8850695 murrays second serve are nowhere near good enough level at this level and they will be punished they seem to be getting shorter and shorter too
8850696 murray looks a little bit too patient and passive at the moment llodra looks composed and confident these are alarming moments for the sixth seed
8850697 murray has got to dig a little deeper that first set was so controlled he though he could come out and pick up where he left off but llodra is too good a player
8850698 murray does not want to try to be too clever the intensity wasnt there for him in that game that should be a wake up call for him
8850699 thats the sampras way get the early break and hold hold hold till you win the set good start now sustain it
8850700 only the single break but it was all he needed murray takes the first set and he has barely broken sweat
8850701 not much drama in this match so far it has been more about mistakes than winners
8850702 murray will be very happy sitting back on the baseline playing rallies because he knows he will come out on top in most of them
8850703 you have to hope this is going to be straightforward for murray anything more than three sets is wasted energy hopefully hell put llodra away quickly
8850704 in terms of lending the main area of focus remains buy to let where tenant demand remains strong and rents are rising however we plan to reduce mortgage volumes in the second half and into 2009 until more favourable economic conditions return
8850705 was the one record he was certain would still be around when he died
8850706 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
8850707 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8850708 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back
8850709 i just hit the starter button and it didnt work
8850710 we tried everything in the end we rolled the car back pushed it and finally got it going
8850711 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8850712 we believe that the department for work and pensions should support adults who become carers during their working lives to combine work and care and enable those who wish to return to paid work when caring ends or changes to do so
8850713 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8850714 but what has he done that would make him qualified to be president
8850715 entiendo que no soy el candidato m s probable para este puesto no encajo en el prototipo habitual y no he pasado mi carrera en los salones de washington
8850716 estoy ante ustedes por que en am rica se est sintiendo algo

8850718 am rica somos mejores que estos ltimos ocho a os

8850720 no es a causa de que a john mccain no le importe es por que john mccain no lo entiende
8850721 la semana que viene en minnesota el mismo partido que les ha tra do dos legislaturas de george bush y dick cheney pedir a este pa s una tercera
8850722 el 4 de noviembre debemos levantarnos y decir ocho es suficiente
8850723 a john mccain le gusta decir que seguir a bin laden hasta las puertas del infierno pero no llegar ni a la cueva donde vive
8850724 que dice acerca de su juicio el que est de acuerdo con bush el 90 por ciento de las veces
8850725 si john mccain quiere tener un debate sobre qui n tiene el temperamento el juicio de servir como el pr ximo comandante en jefe ese es un debate para el que estoy preparado
8850726 somos el partido de roosevelt somos el partido de kennedy as que no me dig is que los dem cratas no defendemos este pa s
8850727 como comandante en jefe nunca vacilar a defender esta naci n pero s lo enviar a nuestras tropas al peligro con una misi n clara y un compromiso sagrado de darles el equipamiento que necesitan en la batalla y el cuidado y las ventajas que merecen cuando vuelven a casa

8850736 it is now almost three weeks since the bodies of xi zhou and zhen xing yang were discovered
8850737 since then officers have been working tirelessly to catch their killers
8850738 they have been examining forensic evidence cctv mobile phone and banking records computer and website data
8850739 we are building a picture of xi zhou and zhen xing yang and possible motives behind their deaths
8850740 i hope that anybody who has information and has yet to come forward will see the new appeal and contact my officers
8850741 ces m canismes qui amputent les recettes du r gime g n ral
8850742 first of all we have to progress from the group stage and to do that you need 10 points to qualify
8850743 the tournament really kicks off in february that is when it gets exciting the one off knock out stages
8850744 i think we have a squad to challenge the best but you cannot think of yourselves as favourites when you see teams like ac milan barcelona and juventus all great names
8850745 we will make sure we apply ourselves in the right way then we will have a chance
8850746 standard liege were a surprise to me because belgian football has not been that great for some years now but it was an excellent performance against liverpool
8850747 i am delighted for our fans we have once again drawn the champions of europe last season it was ac milan the year before it was barcelona
8850748 if we are going to play in europe and we are very proud to be scotlands representatives we may as well start with the big ones
8850749 they dont come much bigger than manchester united so we are delighted we have done very well at home and are proud of our record
8850750 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8850751 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8850752 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8850753 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
8850754 i believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming
8850755 i think we address it as plausibly as possible it helps that the show is kind of fantastic and i feel like weve gotten away with worse
8850756 we do provide an explanation and we dont tease the audience its not a flash of saras ponytail disappearing down an alley for the first eight episodes everyone wondering when shell actually make a face to face with michael shes back first episode michael and sara are reunited and then the gang hits the ground running because theres work to do
8850757 we do have an assemblage of old friends and foes standing together to take on the company and i think if anything thats what remains the same about prison break season in and season out
8850758 we do change the playing field but at its core the show is about six or seven alpha dogs shoved in a cage fighting together at each others throats but still having to work together to achieve some common goal
8850759 michael and lincoln between them have intentionally or unintentionally killed so many people and yet theyre still running around with t bag
8850760 its really a testament to robert knepper that his character has survived through four whole seasons but the man t bag is a maniac a psychopath and a child killer and a rapist and yet he and the boys are still digging ditches together eventually you have to wonder when is enough enough because it really makes my character look bad these are the questions that i think eventually we have to answer or suffer a falloff in terms of believability and quality
8850761 weve battled many serious adversaries michael season two had that great face to face with the president of the united states and you really thought that this was going to be the end of the journey
8850762 it turns out that someone else has been pulling the strings and in many ways they have to go back to square one what the team realizes is that they can no longer flee they have to stand up and fight its time to take on the puppet master and really put this whole conspiracy thing to bed
8850763 i think we not only jumped the shark long ago i think were inventing new sharks
8850764 its not csi its not law and order it cant run forever
8850765 i do feel as though we may be on one of our final laps around the track and it is something that weighs on my mind from time to time telling a story correctly necessitates knowing when to end it
8850766 in order for his brother to go free so many people have died in the process and i think that weighs terribly on michaels conscience
8850767 once this experience is over once they successfully destroy the conspiracy there is no returning to his white collar existence as a structural engineer i think the only thing that michael is kind of fit for at this point is as a hired gun which actually dovetails quite nicely with the direction season four takes
8850768 i love pogo ive been playing on pogo com for about a good 4 years now i just now got my friends to join pogo as well and they love it i am 24 years old i have 3 daughters now

8850802 this shows the acquaintance and unity that flows in this association its not only about remembering them but also honouring their work before they passed on
8850803 the fallen colleagues are resting happily and appreciating the work you do for their families
8850804 there are currently close to 4 000 centrifuges active at natanz enrichment facility another 3 000 centrifuges are being installed
8850805 the prime minister will be questioned for a seventh time
8850806 the amount of fail on theforum com is reaching epic proportions
8850807 we are likely to see inflation settle below the 20 digit mark
8850808 if companies invest on capital expenditure like buildings that is an indication of growth and also shows underlying confidence in the economy by investors
8850809 our view is that these measures will negatively impact international investor confidence in the equity market and could negatively impact equity market liquidity
8850810 in our view the increasing intervention of government in the stock market to provide stabilisation will concern international investors
8850811 suspicion around the extent and vulnerability of bank exposures to market losses
8850812 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
8850813 e dward theres something that i want to do before im not human anymore
8850814 t ell me what you want and you can have it bella
8850815 along the route i saw thousands of villagers running towards the town some were on foot some on their bicycles some were taking their cattle villagers have loaded their entire lifes acquisitions on ox carts and trying to escape the waters
8850816 every where you look there is water houses are submerged shops are under water and people can be seen wading through water
8850817 i think hes one of the top quarterbacks in the country
8850818 i think he can create a lot of problems for people this year
8850819 hes that double threat of being a runner and a passer he knows where to go with the football what true freshman backup chris whitney didnt have last year was that ability yet to read a defense antwon brings that back
8850820 he can also scramble make some plays that way hes experienced and hes a winner
8850821 he can do a lot of different things to make it happen he worked hard to come back even stronger and faster
8850822 i was actually excited to get into camp just to be able to run around and compete in drills again
8850823 you can get a feel of things from the sideline but sitting outs pretty tough all my friends were out there the quarterbacks supposed to be the leader i felt like i kind of let our team down a little bit because we were doing pretty good
8850824 i actually feel a lot better than i did before the injury ive been working out with the trainers and strength and conditioning coaches through the summer a lot of lower body things im running harder its great
8850825 i cant think about the injury throughout the rehab ive worked on my agility i probably improved on some things im capable of leading the team i feel like im ready for anything
8850826 in high school i really never ran i joke with the coaches a lot that i really dont like to run but when things open up i guess im starting to enjoy becoming a runner
8850827 now i kind of get yelled at every once in awhile if i pitch it
8850828 this is more of a homage to the original series
8850829 were taking some inspiration from the first show and of course the setting but everything else is changed
8850830 im doing the prep for it right now i didnt get recognized in canada very often if i did nobody would approach me or take a picture down here there are range rovers and paparazzi everywhere its a culture shock but im rolling with it
8850831 we really believe people will connect to these teens the same way they connected to characters on the original series
8850832 kids grow up a lot faster these days and that will be reflected in the storylines were keeping it as real as we can
8850833 everything was 100 percent focused on the game at hand i think we take that into consideration

8850835 we do have a depth problem on the offensive line no question about that
8850836 usually when a team gets a big play on you its because people arent doing what theyre supposed to do and blown assignments on the field
8850837 a lot more people are focused and want to do the job
8850838 coach told us after the game last year that were bringing basically the whole team back
8850839 if we make the same mistakes the outcome will not change
8850840 we have more depth and we have more experience so this is a much better team from start to finish
8850841 our football iq is much better our nucleus is strong this year and should be even stronger next year
8850842 im anxious to see what we have were not going to have as many freshmen on the field which will be a big bonus

8850880 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes

8850893 the continent of africa has one of the lightest carbon footprints in the world but is paying a very heavy price for human induced climate change
8850894 erratic rainfall is causing havoc in mozambique the strange pattern of drought followed by excessive rains and flooding prevents crops from being able to grow and so people are struggling to eat
8850895 climate change already may be killing 150 000 each year according to the world health organisation
8850896 if climate change is not averted an additional 80 to 120 million people will be at risk of hunger seventy to 80 per cent of these will be in africa where decreasing rainfall and increased drought is adding to existing problems of chronic poverty and food shortages
8850897 were all in this together climate change affects us all
8850898 but it is people in developing countries who are most affected despite the fact that they are the ones least responsible for creating the problem in the first place
8850899 unlimited internet access thats 5x faster than our leading competitors
8850900 centigrade in a nutshell is about a guy who lives in an old dilapidated busted up trailer
8850901 theres no wheels on it its just laying dead in the weeds the owner does a bad thing and he wakes up in the morning and the trailer is rolling down the highway its being towed by a big black pickup truck
8850902 the doors wont open and the windows wont break and he cant get out thats essentially what its about its about a man trapped
8850903 theres maybe three or four lines of dialogue throughout the whole film
8850904 its all basically visual imagery and telling the story through images
8850905 other sources of inspiration for the writer included rod serlings
8850906 my lead actor the guy that i wanted basically was blowing me off fine great ill do it i dont want to say it worked out better but it worked out quicker i didnt need to spend a lot of time talking to the other actor i knew what i needed but its hard to flip back and forth
8850907 i think the trick for me directorially was to create a guy who was a bad guy just a bad guy that you would not feel sorry for at all and take him through the process of basically being trapped like an animal and seeing if i can get the audience to have some compassion for him
8850908 heres a guy youd never think twice of just a real dirt bag and yet because youre trapped with him youve got to go through everything that this guy goes through theres definitely a bit of judgment day atonement at the end of it you become him he definitely gets his comeuppance theres no question about it and sometimes its not a pretty site but thats what it is
8850909 maybe a bit of karma who knows maybe at the end of the day there might be something waiting for you the message is to maybe think twice no matter where you come from
8850910 were developing it into a feature we basically started off making a short but were developing it into a feature film we should have that done within the next six months
8850911 he michael llodra is a really tough guy to play against and i was happy i won in four sets
8850912 it was always going to be tough hes got a huge serve and being a lefty makes it tougher
8850913 hes won doubles slams before two tournaments at the start of this year
8850914 he will give anyone a tough match very rarely will he lose easily he moves really well up at the net doesnt give you a lot of rhythm and i think hes definitely in the top two or three net players for now
8850915 theres very few guys that play that well up at the net and he moves well up there too it was a tough match
8850916 in the light of continuing weakness in the housing market and the wider economy we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year although we will be putting further resources into tackling the problem
8850917 we are determined to do everything possible to promote long term stability and fairness in the housing market
8850918 the international credit crunch has created significant challenges not just for the uk housing market but in other parts of europe and the united states
8850919 we are looking at a wide range of options to further support the housing market in the current climate working closely with industry and lenders what form that support will take will be announced in due course
8850920 he robinho showed he is a world class player both at madrid and for brazil and world class players adapt
8850921 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8850922 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8850923 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8850924 he will have to get used to it because it is different to spain but he showed he is a world class player both at madrid and for brazil and world class players adapt

8850936 we are going to be filing a complaint with the state attorney generals office and calling for his involvement
8850937 i think it was more a general concern that had come up
8850938 i thought wow i thought it was a good idea i asked our city if we could do it and they said sure
8850939 i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet

8851021 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8851022 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
8851023 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
8851024 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
8851025 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
8851026 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
8851027 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche

8851054 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece

8851056 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
8851057 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

8851066 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
8851067 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
8851068 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8851069 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8851070 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8851071 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8851074 these kinds of public allegations made without supporting evidence need to stop because im concerned this is starting to undermine public confidence in our public hospitals
8851075 this crisis would not have happened if the beattie bligh government had listened to frontline clinical staff
8851076 seriously sick and injured people do not need their hardworking doctors and nurses to be distracted by a tirade from an incompetent minister
8851077 they have every right to make public comment however i think theres a responsibility on everybody that they provide accurate advice
8851078 thats silly but the word crisis must certainly be one of the most overused words in the political vocabulary
8851079 what i believe is a crisis is when the system is going backwards when you have beds closing medical staff resigning when you fail to keep pace with the numbers coming through the door youre in free fall
8851080 what we have in queensland health is in fact the opposite
8851081 there is pressure when the system is working to capacity
8851082 when it has gone beyond capacity in my opinion that is a significant issue it is dysfunctional it is a crisis
8851083 the obvious answer is yes because they are good players but its not as simple as that
8851084 theres like what percentage of your salary cap would it cost to get him and all that stuff
8851085 i can be quoted saying yeah brisbane lions are interested in daniel kerr but youd be interested in chris judd or youd be interested in lance franklin
8851086 any good player wed be interested in but the logistical practical getting of them is very different than just saying theyre good players youd like them in your team
8851087 the name that popped into my mind was daniel kerr for some reason
8851088 he isnt as bulky as i was but hes a sort of bore in midfielder who can be dangerous in the forward line
8851089 you can be undefeated for the whole season as geelong almost are but youve still got to win the preliminary final and the grand final to win the premiership so youve got to win those two consecutive games
8851090 the pure statistical facts are no team in my living memory has won 37 out of 38 games
8851091 were very conscious of the history weve read a lot of messages and so forth from supporters
8851092 but our guys are pretty connected to that anyway and mainly because its now their turn
8851093 they do have an awareness but theyre not hung up on whats been before and they recognise to that end theyve got a great opportunity to do something that has meaning and thats important to them
8851094 obviously it was a big step for the group on saturday afternoon when we won here for the first time in eight years
8851095 most of the guys are pretty aware of the history behind ellis park so its another milestone and hoodoo to break if we perform well on saturday afternoon
8851096 its obviously there the history and the way that south africa play at ellis park is very good but i dont think that its something that the guys are too intimidated by its just a matter of embracing it and performing well
8851097 it took a lot of time but i think that i was pretty keen on winning so i was reasonably focused on that
8851098 we realise that what we were last week wont be good enough and we think that that injection of enthusiasm will serve us well
8851099 the good thing for tahu is hes had a good background of preparation now so its not nearly so daunting for him as it may have been if hed gone in in week one
8851100 you look at the context they are going to bring everything that theyve got plus a bit more because they wont be enjoying their current circumstance
8851101 last week we were able to deny early some of that pressure and that will be important again
8851102 shes upset shes made a mistake she knows shes made a mistake and shes embarrassed
8851103 she regrets profoundly driving whilst having a low range bac but she is confident that this is a one off occurrence and will never re occur
8851104 the number of firsts achieved by her is a relatively long list
8851105 the number of achievements she has recorded in her life is impressive
8851106 but today she has recorded a first of a very different character one that shes not at all proud of she was charged with drink driving
8851107 she feels that what has happened does not impact on her personal integrity and she believes that she can continue to fulfil her role as a serving magistrate of this state without any interference at all
8851108 i believe it came from the journalists pocket thats what he told me on the day
8851109 were glad the matter has been resolved but reject totally what the defendants said in court as to their dealings with dylan howard except insofar as he was told that the documents were found in the street
8851110 a witness was present for all dealings between dylan and the individuals in question
8851111 we support dylan howard and can vouch for the fact that dylans conduct was entirely appropriate and not as described in court today
8851112 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this
8851113 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8851114 since the government pulled the legislation from the house yesterday there has been no discussion with the unions and our members are furious at the lack of consultation
8851115 its their last home game and buderus wont be playing and theyve got a big old boys party its a massive occasion for the knights
8851116 theres going to be a lot of emotion in their boys because buderus is not playing and they have guys like steve simpson and the old heads up there will be leading the charge
8851117 its going to be a tough ask weve got to be on our game as soon as we get there because its going to be pretty full on
8851118 it can be harmful we need to be careful we dont get over excited about it
8851119 weve got a tough game to play and we certainly need to meet them head on but we dont want to get over excited and have no energy left at the end of the game
8851120 melbourne is a very physical team they base their game on physical dominance it aint gonna be a place for shrinking violets on saturday afternoon thats for sure
8851121 it was basically to save us from travelling with an emphasis on recovery this week
8851122 its a great part of the world the central coast its great to unwind when youve got free time but when we were training everything was all switched on an focused
8851123 a third year would be a bonus its there in the back of our minds but you cant win minor premierships if youre not focusing on the week to week stuff
8851124 the operating results from north america for the year were outstanding and mainly reflect an extremely strong ferrous performance from virtually all business units across the region particularly in the fourth quarter
8851125 management will continue to monitor the new zealand economy and react accordingly
8851126 its a serious long term challenge and these high achieving organisations are going to play a central role in securing indigenous peoples participation
8851127 doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8851128 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8851129 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8851130 in the growing standoff with the west russia is practically alone
8851131 in a restrained manner and without recognizing south ossetia and abkhazia they did side with their partner
8851132 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia
8851133 people still are used to deflation and now theyre starting to see the prices of their daily necessities going up sharply
8851134 looking ahead the contribution from high energy prices should diminish
8851135 all the evidence points to these animals being warm blooded
8851136 it was fun to see the guys relax we messed up the locker room a little bit
8851137 we could have been known as the team with the great start and didnt make the playoffs or a team that had a great start and success afterward
8851138 our pitching has carried us the last week or two
8851139 schon nachdem ich meine erste tochter gestillt hatte wirkte mein busen irgendwie ausgelutscht jetzt habe ich auch mein zweites t chterchen gestillt und meine br ste h ngen mir ungelogen bis zum bauchnabel ich f hle mich so furchtbar trage nur noch schlabbersachen und sch me mich auch so vor meinem mann obwohl der immer sagt ihm mache das nichts aber das glaube ich nicht ich bin 36 jahre alt meine mutter meint das w re halt so wenn man kinder hat und ich k nne doch stolz darauf sein mit diesen br sten zwei babys ern hrt zu haben aber ich mag mich nicht mehr im spiegel ansehen jetzt berlege ich ob ich eine sch nheitsoperation machen und mir die br ste straffen lassen soll habe aber auch angst dass meine familie das l cherlich findet

8851141 were going to have to get better faster because the competition is going to get a lot better
8851142 its the best block you can have when you put somebody on his back
8851143 after the game coach johnson came up to me and said hell of a job blocking
8851144 i thought i could do something better i was trying to show off
8851145 these guys want to try a little more of everything
8851146 if you have a mobility impairment gravity is your enemy
8851147 we need a president who understands the world today the future we seek and the change we need
8851148 barack obama will bring down health care costs and at long last deliver affordable accessible health care for all
8851149 its certainly a rare event but no one can discount the possibility of those sort of things happening
8851150 a loud bang was heard by passengers and crew followed by the rapid depressurisation of the cabin
8851151 we will continue to assist the atsb to ensure that factors that may have contributed to the incident are understood and that any ultimately identified are implemented
8851152 its a serious long term challenge and these high achieving organisations are going to play a central role in securing indigenous peoples participation
8851153 the operating results from north america for the year were outstanding and mainly reflect an extremely strong ferrous performance from virtually all business units across the region particularly in the fourth quarter
8851154 very carefully and keep in mind that the court has declared them the solarium claims to be false or misleading
8851155 doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8851156 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states

8851178 they have beaten on the odd occasion and we are not playing the nba finals this weekend its not a best of seven its just a one off event
8851179 were very conscious of the history weve read a lot of messages and so forth from supporters

8851208 theres like what percentage of your salary cap would it cost to get him and all that stuff
8851209 i can be quoted saying yeah brisbane lions are interested in daniel kerr but youd be interested in chris judd or youd be interested in lance franklin
8851210 any good player wed be interested in but the logistical practical getting of them is very different than just saying theyre good players youd like them in your team
8851211 the name that popped into my mind was daniel kerr for some reason
8851212 he isnt as bulky as i was but hes a sort of bore in midfielder who can be dangerous in the forward line
8851213 you can be undefeated for the whole season as geelong almost are but youve still got to win the preliminary final and the grand final to win the premiership so youve got to win those two consecutive games
8851214 the pure statistical facts are no team in my living memory has won 37 out of 38 games
8851215 so clearly in that period they have been more dominant for almost two seasons than any other side in my memory
8851216 i thought i could do something better i was trying to show off

8851228 thats what we do thats what people in communities do
8851229 i didnt have a sense that there would be a change
8851230 we were really handcuffed because we were tied up in juneau
8851231 it was probably one race i didnt take for granted i was probably more nervous because of being gone
8851232 i will never look at politics the same way again
8851233 ill continue to do what i think got me to the point im at which is to answer phone calls and e mails
8851234 je ne pense rien du tout je profite simplement de linstant et je verrai bien ce qui mattend pour la suite je joue match par match et on verra bien je nai pas encore r alis que jai battu la n 1 mondiale je nai pas non plus r alis que je lavais fait sur un si grand court je ne sais m me pas comment je vais parvenir mendormir cette nuit sur la balle de match je me disais allez cest le dernier point cest ce point que tu dois gagner et toute la pression est venue dun coup je ne sais pas comment jai fait aujourdhui c tait juste le jour parfait peut tre que je vais comprendre ce qui marrive demain ou bien quand mon tournoi sera termin
8851235 and the gal at the desk shed been working all night
8851236 it was a 10 second thing but i saw her looking where the hells the orderly
8851237 would somebody please outline to me the advantages of our doing it this way
8851238 for me an albertan what are they can you give me a couple of them what do i as an albertan gain by this mad rush up there
8851239 it was quite an unusual dinner it was polite but you know
8851240 showed courage and gallantry in vietnam and left with their honor intact
8851241 now our duty is to render service to the soldiers of this generation
8851242 you the vietnam veterans are the generation that our new warriors will look to for direct support you tell this generation that you have their backs
8851243 vietnam remains a constant memory nearly every family was affected in that war many in our nation had the anxiety of watching a loved one leaving for vietnam but for tens of thousands of others war meant a crushing blow an unfulfilled life
8851244 bless those who will carry on the tradition we started
8851245 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8851246 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8851247 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8851248 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8851249 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8851250 i was simply astounded by tiana on a scale of 1 to 10 i rate her a perfect 20 yes 20 its hard to believe this stunning woman is only 19 years of age she has it all a gorgeous face with those huge mischievous expressive eyes flawless complexion full red kissable lips and her slender seductive perfectly proportioned statuesque supple body covered with that beautiful rose pink flower petal soft smooth skin in addition to the class poise and confidence of a mature woman in fact she seems too perfect to be a woman more like a magnificent heavenly goddess i look forward to seeing more of her as soon as possible
8851251 aesthetically its not appealing and with the electromagnetic fields that could be damaging to peoples health and putting them near residential would be bad for the community
8851252 i think the best option is to run it alongside of the railroad only because theres nothing really that goes there other than some industrial buildings
8851253 it keeps it away from residents as much as possible
8851254 id like to see it go right next to the railroad
8851255 at that point we would hope to see three alternatives or perhaps more
8851256 once you begin to put lines on paper i anticipate well be getting more feedback
8851257 the prime minister will be questioned for a seventh time
8851258 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8851259 all equipment has been received for the establishment of the garbage composite plant at the municipal garbage dumping site this will help get rid of the garbage that litters everywhere in town and could help restore mbale as one of the cleanest towns in uganda
8851260 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8851261 they have quite remarkable planning and self organisation more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8851262 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8851263 they have quite remarkable planning and self organisation more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8851264 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8851265 in a city like bombay all of us are playing all movies in smaller centers we might let go a couple of english movies releasing in the same week or might just let a smaller movie go it does cannibalize in business in terms of when there are so many releases it does cannibalize also in the business of movies that released last week if they are really good one might watch them instead of watching new ones
8851266 a release needs a sense of space if you crowd it with a lot of films of the same genre it gets confusing for the audience you know what happened to bhagat singh 4 bhagat singhs releasing at the same time so we dont wanna get into this rat race
8851267 a film will work on their own merit i cant comment on other films or this film eventually it is your job to the best and after that let the audiences decide what they wanna see
8851268 its a little frustrating because weve had significant system breakdowns
8851269 its not the citys fault its not anybodys fault it just happens
8851270 the cameras were inoperable the antennas were inoperable and whatever other infrastructure is in there got damaged
8851271 theres not many plausible explanations you can come up with except a jolt of lightning
8851272 weve put up signs and everybodys having a lot of fun taking them down
8851273 im not a big fan of them to begin with so i cant say im hugely concerned theyre malfunctioning

8851279 weil wir unsere mitarbeiter binden wollen war diese gemeinsame arbeit zus tzlich wichtig
8851280 how we think about licences is getting a bit more nuanced
8851281 eclipse is an important lively and healthy project with an enormous plug in and developer community that uses an otherwise duplicative licence they arent interested in using the bsd or other open source licences that are readily combinable with epl code
8851282 we have decided that after nearly two years of operation that it was time to add the epl and serve these open source developers
8851283 achten sie aber unbedingt darauf ob die speichenclips auch vom kraftfahrtbundesamt kba f r den stra enverkehr zugelassen sind
8851284 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8851285 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8851286 until we gain access to the house and complete our search and examination we are not in a position to make any further comment on such issues
8851287 questa storia lho trovata per caso leggendo un quotidiano e vedendo un telegiornale ho incontrato miloud e subito dopo sono volato a bucarest per rendermi conto di persona della situazione l ho deciso che questo film lo dovevo fare
8851288 il film parada dice il vero miloud nella conferenza stampa di presentazione non si pu scindere dal progetto reale parada non avrebbe senso questopera era importante al di l dei suoi meriti artistici proprio perch testimonia gli sforzi le difficolt e i successi di quindici anni di lavoro non abbiamo ancora finito i bambini di strada non sono solo un problema di bucarest ma una realt che riguarda tutti i paesi dal brasile alla francia

8851290 a spingermi a indagare dice benevenuti sul suicidio della cameriera della famiglia puccini da sempre ritenuta lamante del maestro stata unintuizione sul legame tra arte e vita i personaggi femminili dei libretti assomigliavano alle donne frequentate dal musicista nella sua vita volevamo provare lesattezza della nostra ipotesi la minnie de la fanciulla del west non era ispirata alla cameriera doria manfredi ma alla cugina di lei giulia una ragazza bella forte indipendente locandiera e cacciatrice a torre de lago era lei lamante di puccini

8851371 a lot of years they let me go off and play basketball
8851372 now to be able to spend time with them its awesome
8851373 when we take the field on friday night nothing less than three points is going to be acceptable
8851374 to get a sense of how important this game is i talked to my team today about what its going to take to win the match i usually reserve that for the day before the match i really feel like this is a gigantic game three points is really the only acceptable result
8851375 right now they are a team below us in the standings and were trying to keep them below us
8851376 the rocky mountain cup thing is there and thats important but right now were trying to make the playoffs and winning for that reason is the main goal
8851377 it was fun to see the guys relax we messed up the locker room a little bit
8851378 we could have been known as the team with the great start and didnt make the playoffs or a team that had a great start and success afterward
8851379 our pitching has carried us the last week or two

8851387 we respect them as an opponent but im not going to be intimidated by them just because theyre the university of michigan
8851388 i thought it was going to be a big towering structure but when we got there it was kind of underwhelming when it fills in its magnificent and they have an incredible program and tradition but in the end were all football players fighting for the same thing
8851389 there are a lot of veterans here and weve been in a lot of tough situations
8851390 we arent going to let a lot of people or a big stadium affect us
8851391 i saw the fumble come out and picked up the ball i looked at the ref he looked at me and i just started running
8851392 they were driving down on us so to see a d lineman running down the field everyone got excited and picked everything up

8851454 an ancient sage said that none of us should criticize another until we have walked a mile in the other persons boots this wise advice can give us greater compassion for our fellow human beings and putting it into practice makes us feel much better than being hung over let live yes but some of us find just as much value in the first part of the slogan live when we have worked out ways to enjoy our own living fully then we are content to let other people live any way they want if our own lives are interesting and productive we really have no impulse or desire to find fault with others or worry about the way they act can you think right this minute of someone who bothers you if you can try something postpone thinking about him or her and whatever it is about the person that riles you you can boil inside about it later if you want to but for right now why not put it off while you read the next paragraph live be concerned with your own living in our opinion staying sober opens up the way to life and happiness it is worth sacrificing many a grudge or argument okay so you didnt manage to keep your mind completely off that other person lets see whether the suggestion coming next will help

8851534 it was a very tight match between us the last time and we feel that we were unlucky to lose it
8851535 actually all of the games that we have played against eachother this season have been pretty tight so this should be another cracking match
8851536 cork are a very good team with some excellent players and we know that it will be tough to break them down but weve been playing well in the last few games so we will be confident of winning it
8851537 in a way we can use the cup game as motivation to get revenge over them they knocked us out of the competition which was a big blow as we felt that we could have at least reached the final of it this year
8851538 the cup is over for us but we want to finish as high as we can in the league so we will be looking to get the win and it would be nice to get one over them at the same time
8851539 when i accepted this job i knew it wouldnt be easy
8851540 if i was in one of those cities and i lost a race id feel the same way they do
8851541 but if you take a step back and look at the big picture and if you love this sport for it to be a national or international and global brand its important to be in a market like this
8851542 people have to remember nascar didnt start out being as popular in daytona either
8851543 nigeria is solid on liberalisation of its skies and would remain in the forefront of efforts to actualise full implementation of the yamoussoukro accord in the continent
8851544 we strongly believe in yamoussoukro and the banjul accord group but what we will like to do is to make sure we start it from the west african region
8851545 nigeria will benefit immensely from the liberalisation because we have the routes the population airlines with modern fleet and can make it happen because it is a natural thing for us
8851546 we contribute most to the african development bank adb and also to ecowas so we are well placed to maximise the gains of such liberalisation
8851547 im committed to it and i want our government to make it happen to go all the way down and make sure its a reality open up the place remove barriers and get the gains
8851548 interlining code sharing strategic partnerships alliances is the way to go and thats what we are doing now in nigeria

8851557 the legislative system is not working for nigeria the legislators are spending more time on themselves than the people they are supposed to represent
8851558 if our politics becomes people oriented in that way you will eliminate the place of godfather in politics
8851559 because the average politician in nigeria does not depend on the people to get elected policies are not reflecting the need to improve the lives of the people all you need to do satifiy that godfather if you satisfy him you are okay you do npot have oppoistiion so you will always work towrasd his interest rather than the interest of the braod generality of the people i believe that if have politics that is oriented differently and the people did count we will see more improvement than we are seeing presently
8851560 our political process is for the politicians for instance when teachers were on strike protesting for salary increment thereby grounding our schools the national assembly did little to assuage the situation they instead went ahead increased their own emolument that to me is case of not being responsive to the people
8851561 nigeria needs a full national assembly the work of national assembly members is a full time one it is not only going into the chamber to sit down and deliberate into the legislation
8851562 we are not going back on the implementation of the international court of justice judgment i have been served the court order but the supreme court had said in a number of cases that a court order must be explicit to enable the person to whom the order is directed to understand and comply i am duty bound to obey a court but the court must be explicit i do not understand which status quo the learned judge is referring to what is the res the res is the final judgment of the icj which we are bound to comply with
8851563 the parties to this suit case should maintain the status quo so that the res will not be destroyed the res in this case is southern bakassi which is to be ceded by the defendants fgn and cross river state government on august 14th 2008

8851642 repeatedly and in many different contexts we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim
8851643 it is no more appropriate for judges to determine the centrality of religious beliefs before applying a compelling interest test in the free exercise field than it would be for them to determine the importance of ideas before applying the compelling interest test in the free speech field
8851644 courts should not undertake to dissect religious beliefs because the believers beliefs are not articulated with the clarity and precision that a more sophisticated person might employ
8851645 does not permit a court to determine whether the belief or practice in question is compelled by or central to a system of religious belief

8851661 current tensions put turkey in a very tight spot because it is under pressure from russia and its western allies
8851662 turkey is again a frontline state like in the cold war but the difference now is that its dependency on russia is much bigger
8851663 turkey must act like a nato member if it wants its place in trans atlantic relations it became nato member years ago and that means turkey has to support the steps that nato takes

8851669 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
8851670 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries
8851671 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8851672 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8851673 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8851674 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8851675 we reject the policies that the government wants to impose through a decree
8851676 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8851677 we have come here to get them to acknowledge the court order
8851678 if there is no reaction the police will have to do something
8851679 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8851680 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8851681 bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8851682 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8851683 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8851684 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8851685 people of every creed and color from every walk of life
8851686 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8851687 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8851688 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8851689 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington

8851694 while there is no disguising the seriousness of the situation for the centro group we are making incremental steps towards stabilisation in a difficult environment
8851695 our fundamental task remains to secure long term debt restructuring and we will continue to work with our lending groups to achieve this goal

8851697 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8851698 it is best to aim a bit forward of the flys starting position to anticipate where its going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8851699 we were surprised to find that long in fly time before a fly takes off in response to a predator or swatter it plans the direction of the jump by making a rather complex series of postural movements
8851700 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8851701 this shows how rapidly the flys brain processes sensory information into an appropriate motor response weve also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8851702 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct pre flight posture

8851720 the test results from the diega oil zone are very positive confirming that this new oil resource can be produced at substantial economic rates diega complements our benita oil discovery which is targeted for sanction in 2009 with first oil in 2012 we are excited and encouraged about the potential in this newly discovered lower miocene reservoir our teams are working aggressively to further identify the extensive potential that remains on our large acreage position and to continue our active exploration and development programs in 2009
8851721 the government of equatorial guinea is delighted that another discovery has been made in the equatorial guinea part of the douala basin the government believes that this new discovery further confirms the significant hydrocarbon potential of the douala basin and highlights the positive investment climate which currently exists within the republic of equatorial guinea

8851724 i feel like connected to this politics campaign like i havent ever been before
8851725 hes not going to take the usual bleep the other guys hand out
8851726 my neighbor is involved in politics he got me a ticket i almost didnt go i went when i heard stevie wonder was going to be there but obama man hes tough
8851727 i heard him earlier this year he moved my heart
8851728 every new administration starts over at hanford we cant afford that anymore
8851729 if ron is interested in anything having to do with housing
8851730 its trying to avoid the fact that hes doing very little for nova scotia
8851731 hes trying to deflect the fact that he has not been a proactive premier he has been sitting there hoping that things would get better
8851732 that is not what nova scotians need they need a premier who is going to be leading the way
8851733 he should be telling nova scotians what he is going to be doing
8851734 mr mcneil knows his federal leader has put him in a box
8851735 he doesnt know whether he should be supportive of his party or his province so he sent out a release about me in an attempt to divert attention from the issue
8851736 i cant think of an issue that is more important to nova scotians than the price of home heating oil and other energy costs
8851737 in a careless and reckless manner having regard to all the circumstances including the boys age and lack of experience
8851738 this is a significant decrease in tourism traffic particularly during peak season and appears to be part of an alarming trend
8851739 when the premier was tourism minister in 2002 he made the commitment to double tourism revenues in 10 years
8851740 in 2002 revenues were 1 3 billion and five years later in 2007 they were exactly the same
8851741 tourism operators in nova scotia are looking for leadership from this government and clearly they arent getting it

8851746 so to that end colin in essence is the director of the air ops for the air show in yarmouth
8851747 the potential for what this can do for the yarmouth area is absolutely tremendous itll bring the community together
8851748 a fair involvement from local flying people including one pilot who will have an aircraft in the process of being built in our main tent area
8851749 obviously the highlight of the air show will be the snowbirds
8851750 people recognize the potential of this airport and what it can offer the community
8851751 weve kept the entry level cost to come in at a very very low price
8851752 people are going to get a great bang for their buck
8851753 we hope to drive up voter turnout which has been disappointingly low

8851768 por el contrario las leyes apuntalan derechos ciudadanos fundamentales como son la seguridad alimentaria y el derecho a la vivienda
8851769 es por eso por lo que las atacan los sectores privilegiados por supuesto que establecen regulaciones porque la seguridad alimentaria del pa s no puede estar en manos de los caprichos de unos particulares
8851770 lo que ocurre es que las relaciones de este tipo sic son jer rquicas y violentas por definici n
8851771 he is doing fine he is undergoing some checkups the doctors have told us that absolutely there is no cause for concern
8851772 our public education system is faced with many problems including proposed school closures unfair lunch fees and the need to reinvigorate our schools with more extracurricular programs
8851773 we need a school board that will put education before politics
8851774 many concerns were raised relating to the potential impact of the proposed development on the residential neighbourhoods and existing municipal infrastructure
8851775 the proper way would be for someone to object in 1997 to challenge hrms decision to issue a building permit
8851776 just because they woke up to a new arguable defence that shouldnt be of concern to the court
8851777 its a slow process and wed all like to see it move faster
8851778 at this point consultants should have been hired and the planning should be in place
8851779 once everything is in place they certainly should be able to build a school within a year
8851780 there is still plenty of time to meet that target
8851781 it comes from 86 days of hand pedalling across canada
8851782 were out every day wheeling along the highway and putting our body under physical stress and its all for a great cause
8851783 we looked like drowned rats last night after the downpour outside truro but we soon got dried off
8851784 paralyzed rats are now able to walk because of this research and i believe some day ill walk again and so will anyone who has a spinal cord injury
8851785 when i talk to people along the way and i tell them i actually saw the rats walk after they had this treatment they will sometimes have a tear in their eye
8851786 with this research human paralysis could be a thing of the past ill definitely walk again i know that
8851787 i got sick the next day i was in pain and vomiting
8851788 im 66 and i didnt know i had this condition
8851789 i think most canadians know that when you travel to the united states its a good idea to purchase travel insurance
8851790 the new thing is that students will be now going through a paperless process so the nova scotia portion of their student loan will mostly involve financial aid officers having access to an online portal
8851791 but the reality is that we still have some of the highest tuition fees in the country and that students are still facing huge debt loads in order to attend post secondary education
8851792 our hope is that some of the cost savings that are seen from these programs including things like the direct lend will go toward more grants
8851793 is a good first step in the process of student loans becoming easier and more manageable
8851794 will reduce the amount of processing time from four to five weeks to three weeks
8851795 the way it was explained to me was just too confusing
8851796 thats got to be the way that were going in terms of student assistance
8851797 one of the things that youll see in september when youre on campuses is lineups students going to get a signature here and some information there and this is a process that is unnecessarily complicated
8851798 there is now real demand for the greenback as opposed to speculative positions that people took at the beginning of the year
8851799 i was sure the ileostomy would end my career and it depressed me for a long time
8851800 i told her i didnt think i could handle it but she told me i had no option
8851801 i learned there was more to life than sunday afternoon football i learned we have a choice to get out of the game or play the hand were dealt and hope the next one is better
8851802 we all have our deserts but our oasis is each other our doctor et support group
8851803 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8851804 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8851805 those issues are non partisan and we work both sides of the aisle
8851806 the party platforms are not focused on these issues and where they are theyre pretty similar
8851807 this is about celebrity youve never given any of us a chance
8851808 i went to a movie to relax and clear my head for the fight and chuck was on the screen so you cant escape him anywhere
8851809 but its an honor and its great to be fighting somebody like that because it shows how far ive come along in this sport this is a fight i cant lose so im just gonna go out there and enjoy myself the whole fight
8851810 i learned to handle the pressure a little bit more and how to relax
8851811 when you get in there for your first big high profile fight you just overthink a lot of things and pretty soon youve worked yourself into a frenzy and made the fight bigger than what it is
8851812 i think rashad got caught up in his first big show
8851813 it looked like it took a while for him to figure out that he was supposed to be there
8851814 this is a fun fight for me and thats how im taking it
8851815 this is one of the legends of the sport and to have the opportunity to fight him is an honor in itself so im just gonna go out there and enjoy every minute of it i respect chuck i was a big fan of his and i know what hes done for the sport but at the same time i still want to go out there and kick his ass its just the competitor in me if we were playing air hockey id try to kick his ass in it i just compete
8851816 it dont take much to motivate me for a fight
8851817 but the big thing is im motivated to get the title back and end my career on a streak of wins thats the way i want to do it
8851818 like i keep telling everybody ive got two to four years and hopefully in two years im still saying two to four years
8851819 i still love fighting i still love training and i still love what i do so ill be here as long as my body lets me im still here to prove that im the best at 205 thats what im here for so im gonna have to do it against the young guys its great that these guys are coming up and proving that i can still beat em is fun for me
8851820 its been a benefit to me just because i had more time in the gym and anytime you get more time you just practice your craft and you get better
8851821 theres nothing like real life competition but by the same token being in the gym helps you brush up on all the things you werent before you get to fine tune
8851822 hes given me pointers but our styles are so different
8851823 he has given me things that he was looking out for but its all about execution i cant go in there and think that just because keith jardine executed the way he did that ill be able to do the same exact thing i have to go in there and find my own rhythm with chuck and learn for myself
8851824 i feel like ive got a pretty good chin anyways
8851825 im not the type of person whos gonna worry about getting hit or about somebodys power i respect his power but then at the same time when you sit there and say oh my god he can hit hard thats when you get hit hard you have to go out there and fight if he hits me with a good one then ill hear about it in the dressing room but ive taken a lot of great punches from a lot of hard hitters so im not too worried about it
8851826 im in great shape and ill keep throwing like i do
8851827 the knockout powers still there i just gotta land the punches
8851828 what its gonna come down to is me imposing my will no matter what it takes
8851829 i have to go in there and keeping him guessing chuck has just been killing these wrestlers so well see what i can do

8852062 it doesnt matter im just going out there and if i can show the eagles something thats good if not hopefully one of those 31 other teams are looking sure i want to be a part of this nobody wants to start over but if i have to go i still want to make a living i have a family to take care of
8852063 ill take my butt back to college and finish up my last semester then try again next year i have a semester left for a communications degree
8852064 you never know exactly whats going on or what theyre thinking
8852065 ive been there myself all you can do is control what you control play hard and let it fall where it may
8852066 it was a bad time you have anger disappointment and uncertainty about whats going to happen
8852067 the hardest part is accepting it and the uncertainty of what youre going to do next
8852068 its really not about cutting its about waiting for that next call
8852069 so many games are won in the fourth quarter or lost in the fourth quarter so as much as you can you want to keep those guys fresh for the fourth quarter when we go into the fourth quarter i want our best soldiers on the field and you want to press if a guy plays 65 70 plays you go into the fourth quarter and he doesnt have much gas left
8852070 the game has changed a lot in the 13 years ive been in the league
8852071 before defensive linemen had to do everything now you have guys to rush the passer guys playing against the run they used to have to do both you have to study more because youre probably going against more than one guy
8852072 if you get your opportunity and take advantage of it you can play a while because there are a lot of tricks you can learn as you get older
8852073 its because you dont really have to do much more than block people
8852074 a lot of those other guys even if theyre backups are playing on special teams and putting themselves in position where they can get hurt that has a lot to do with it youre asked to do less youre specializing there arent a lot of other things youre doing
8852075 thats when you can get rolled up from behind thats how you get hurt
8852076 i think a lot of the defensive injuries come from friendly fire you know theyre hitting each other during tackles on top of piles and stuff thats how a lot of them get hurt gang tackling but on the offensive line you can control what you hit and how youre getting hit one of the main things we have to protect is our knees getting rolled up on the line of scrimmage
8852077 they know what spot they have to get to so we have to kind of read off their motions thats pretty much the only advantage they have theyre trying to get their hands on us and we have to prevent them from doing that and get our hands on them first you have to learn how to read certain keys so when you see an offensive lineman move a certain way you know how to react thats the biggest thing for us
8852078 theyve probably helped the offensive linemen because they can hold more
8852079 they dont call holding quite as much they let you grab up in here the chest a little bit i dont think they ever put in rules that help the defense theres a rule that you cant touch a receiver after 5 yards everythings changed a little bit to favor the offense
8852080 you have to hold off guys who are 300 some pounds and at the same time try to get to the ball and make reads see where things are at
8852081 i really think everybody has a mutual respect for each other out there
8852082 i think theres actually more skill involved because its very technical
8852083 the players in what are called skill positions are in more of an athletic position theres more skill involved in what we do
8852084 i thought he had been playing well enough where he could sit this one out
8852085 i was thinking of that when i decided to sit him
8852086 i cant think of another time right off the top of my head maybe there was one
8852087 i already told donovan hes going to hear from my lawyer
8852088 a guy of his stature in the community should be aware of others feelings here he is making me feel ashamed of something that i cant control
8852089 really this is one of the reasons why i will enjoy playing for this team when your leader is that kind of guy who doesnt allow you to take football too seriously its a lot of fun when you talk about me desean and westbrook were all no higher than 5 10 and im the tallest among the three so i feel pretty good about that
8852090 the first lesson is you dont necessarily do everything the fans want you to do
8852091 i am a fan too and i would love to have a squad that is much better than everyone elses
8852092 we are very nearly there but not quite i think we are quite happy we are not going to buy somebody who doesnt improve the squad
8852093 we didnt play well at fulham on saturday but i think all this stuff about us having to buy a complete lot of new players is rubbish

8852099 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8852100 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8852101 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8852102 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8852103 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8852104 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8852105 parents of only children constantly worry that their kid has been ripped off
8852106 im not really worried about whats going to go on
8852107 the coaches they have a lot of decisions to make all around the board not just me just put it in gods hands i just played real hard just left it all out on the field thats been my whole attitude throughout the preseason
8852108 its good when you can just turn it over to god and go out there and play
8852109 take everything else out of it and just go out there its football you grow up playing football your whole life and its supposed to be fun its not supposed to be like eating dirt or whatever sometimes when you put a lot of pressure on yourself you take the fun out of it i really feel like ive turned the corner
8852110 now well go back evaluate the film and make the cuts i thought there were some guys here who really showed well for themselves there were other guys that didnt
8852111 it was my first start although its just the preseason and the starters werent out there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8852112 we know for a fact theres a pent up demand out there for kaas in small business especially in this economy many companies are not ready to make a big upfront investment in software and systems they need a more affordable way to be competitive were leap frogging the limitations of saas software as a service that doesnt allow ownership of a companys own information offers them no control and no customization kaas is here and its ready to go it allows companies to pay for growth on an ongoing basis spreading out the investment while alleviating a lot of the daily technology headaches
8852113 the aspca is proud to assist hsus in the raid of yet another illegal dogfighting ring

8852115 i am glad to be able to lend my expertise in processing the forensic evidence in this case and examining the animal victims
8852116 the mistreatment that these dogs are experiencing is so horrific and while it is a long process if we want to eradicate animal cruelty we need to continue bringing down these offenders one by one

8852120 i like to do things to the best of my ability and it is getting too hard to juggle the commitments
8852121 i feel i have been playing as well as ever and may have had a few more years left but this is the right decision
8852122 we dont need any extra ammunition to get fired up for this game
8852123 ive played against manly since under 11s and its always the game you want to play in
8852124 i was saying to my mum the other day this will be the highlight of my career first grade run on against manly at manly oval
8852125 since i made my run on debut last week its been a pretty good birthday present
8852126 i was going to have a party last week but we have postponed it due to the finals
8852127 hes so good at explaining the areas i need to work on
8852128 hes got these one liners that i take into games and use
8852129 things like small plays win big games and dont think honestly

8852166 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war

8852179 when you talk about andrew symonds its like talking about bradman as a batsman or ponting as a batsman hes in a place of his own hes that good an athlete in many ways like usain bolt
8852180 i think hes the best all around athlete for strength power and speed in cricket ive seen jonty rhodes was good real good ricky ponting is real good michael clarke is real good but none of those guys have the flat out brute athletic power and strength of symonds
8852181 these data are the first to suggest that there is a clinically significant increase in bone fractures among hiv infected patients using data from a large healthcare system
8852182 hiv patients with risk for low bone density should be assessed and potentially treated to prevent fractures
8852183 further research is needed into the mechanisms of bone loss in this population
8852184 so those forms of selenium will differ in their capacity to change someones antioxidant status and capacity to prevent cancer
8852185 it just so happens that when you feed selenium to cows and they produce selenium enriched milk the selenium seems to be in a chemical form that is both highly absorbable into the body and also more effective in terms of preventing cancer

8852187 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8852188 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans
8852189 the results are exciting because they establish a spatial link between recent gullies and accumulation of glacier ice strengthening the case for surface melt water flow in the formation of gullies on mars

8852209 the withdrawal of the case had come as a shock to me and it should not be interpreted as a sign of zardaris innocence

8852220 im not voting for mccain i have a different political standpoint i think obamas proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer
8852221 i wouldnt vote for john mccain if he was a democrat i would not vote at all before id vote for him
8852222 i question whether cindy is someone id want to see in the white house
8852223 the fact is my mother and cindy had lots of contact
8852224 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
8852225 and she said in english wow are you a real norwegian she was so thrilled to see me ive never felt so special in my whole life
8852226 as a city were interested in becoming a first tier cultural center
8852227 that entails opening up and seeing whats happening out there and bringing to philadelphia the best and most interesting work available and it works both ways it also means exporting some of the great thinking were doing in culture
8852228 i feel all countries all cultures all nationalities emphasize their specialties up to a point where you start to forget that people are actually the same anywhere you are
8852229 through this performance im giving the finger to people who want to be so special and want to withdraw from the common society
8852230 its a major tendency in contemporary times and its especially interesting here in the states where everybody has roots from somewhere and very often people identify strongly with those roots
8852231 if youre born in the u s a and grew up in philadelphia you have nothing to do with your old country its just a myth but i know norwegians living in the midwest whove never been to norway but theyre more norwegian than me theres something wrong here
8852232 put ourselves in a position to be the butt of some jokes and the object of some rancor
8852233 it would be really easy to dismiss the show as being look at the funny americans talking about europe but i really think its more of a human tendency to be fascinated with strange customs the semaphore or the smoke signals of a distant culture
8852234 ive also been on backpacking trips in europe where all anyone was interested in at that given moment was finding a mcdonalds so were trying to play with anthropologizing the idea of discovering all these strange truths while holding on very tightly to what we already know and how willing we are to step outside of our comfort zone
8852235 the image of america from swedens point of view is that youre a pretty right wing religious bunch of people
8852236 so this has been an exploration for me to find the other side of america it was the opposite for my great grandfather and joe hill when they came here because there were pretty radical things going on back then politically the story is really religion and politics and can they blend i dont know if they belong together and i dont know where to look for the answers
8852237 i feel like the play that we made is not like either of our existing plays
8852238 we pushed on each other and ended up at a third point which i think was kind of important to us we wanted to do something different from what we usually do
8852239 perhaps the most important thing in theater is to create an atmosphere on stage a new logic
8852240 if you do that the audience will feel that theyve entered a room they havent been in before and they open their senses and are ready to take whatever text or action there is
8852241 i dont want to do something trendy or good work in a certain method i just want to make the actors get into my world if they manage that then automatically we will become original or new in a way thats something i often miss personal work in theater or movies i want to see that there is a sick mind behind things
8852242 when the cast of the show must go on travels
8852243 we are 24 people making some long flights around the world in the past two years the issue of climate change became very intense to me that is why i started to think about how to go showing this piece without spending so much energy and producing co2 i decided this piece should be given to companies around the world so we will save some energy
8852244 here i can make use of all my american references
8852245 i can explain a scene by recalling an episode of seinfeld and they get it and finally i get to work leave it to beaver into a piece
8852246 but we kind of thought its really tough for so many folks in this country i grew up on a farm and i have a lot of passion for farmers i know what they go through its just hard work every day you know of course the corporate farmers theyre doing good but the family farmers they cant make a living on a farm anymore
8852247 i dont know if anybody knows how to fix it just that we thought at least we can sing about it and maybe call attention to a few things
8852248 what would kinky do how to unscrew a screwed up world
8852249 im aware that we havent always met your expectations and id like to talk about how we could improve our performance
8852250 growing up all you hear is negative things about yourself
8852251 then you have this haven where you feel like youre safe and you feel like youre celebrated thats why we have so many successes coming out of whitesboro
8852252 this is a weekend to get together and renew old friendships
8852253 spirit of progressivism is not confined entirely to the caucasian race
8852254 you did what you wanted to do you lived where you wanted to live you bought your own home it was freedom
8852255 i am very proud of whitesboro it was a safe and happy place
8852256 a good boy a handsome boy he was like a son to me and played basketball in my backyard
8852257 if it werent for that town i wouldnt be where i am today
8852258 there was a high standard and an expectation to succeed
8852259 education is the key to unlock the golden door to freedom
8852260 it was you will go to school and you will do well
8852261 it was such a close knit family community if you misbehaved in school your parents knew about it by the time you got home
8852262 you cant walk into whitesboro talking about how youre this or youre that because you grew up with all these people
8852263 they know you they know your mother they know your father they pretty much can call it the way they see it
8852264 there was a time when we felt we were viewed as a town that wasnt going anywhere there was a need for us to prove we could do well
8852265 working with ibm we believe we can deliver substantial cost savings and offer the business a security solution that is both strong and sustainable
8852266 traditionally businesses have tended to deploy multiple small point security solutions sometimes provided by multiple vendors
8852267 while that model worked pretty well for a long time i think business infrastructures are getting complicated enough that approaching security from a single vendor point of view makes a lot of sense for many enterprises
8852268 there is genuine concern about the difficulties people will face paying heating bills over the coming winter and we are looking at extra support
8852269 the poorest families now face an urgent situation the voluntary approach is failing and government and the energy companies need a plan of action within weeks
8852270 a life sized insect who can visit dreams and speak to the dead
8852271 klein had been moving in and i hoped to trap him in a big pot
8852272 while it was possible steve had a big pair i knew he was an advanced player and it was possible he was trying to pick up the pot with a squeeze play
8852273 leading out here would have likely caused steve to fold overcards but if he had a real hand hed probably raise and put me in a tough spot
8852274 a check raise would be a much scarier scenario for steve so i decided to go for it
8852275 the way the hand came down pre flop i figured he had to know this flop was right in my wheelhouse
8852276 my flat calling both kleins raise and steves re raise cried out middle pair or middle connectors i knew he couldnt call my all in with overcards and that there was a decent chance hed suspect a set and lay down a strong hand like an overpair i call this the threat of the set
8852277 when a player makes a big move against a players strong pre flop raise his opponent must consider that hes up against a set it can be a good bluffing opportunity
8852278 her deadpan conversational singing remained rough around the edges and at times phair didnt project enough to lift her voice above the instruments played by her and a three piece backing band which also seemed a bit out of practice
8852279 its kinda cool playing this old record even when i listen to it it takes me back
8852280 how many of you bought this record when it came out in 93

8852310 are you aware that under international law declaration of consensus points is already binding
8852311 under international law it does not matter if an agreement violates our internal rules we must comply with our international obligations
8852312 a case can be brought by malaysia to the icj they can compel us to amend our constitution
8852313 you can see the danger that could have happened if that document moa ad was signed
8852314 they have to inquire as to the nature of the document we never acceded to make this an international document
8852315 a domestic document subject to internal laws of the state
8852316 if the intention of this document is to make this a political agreement then this is not subject to the jurisdiction of the icj
8852317 greenpeace water patrol is taking action by closing down this waste dump this mound of garbage clearly pollutes laguna lake there should never have been a dumpsite here in the first place and there should be no more excuses about cleaning it up immediately
8852318 by continuing to treat laguna lake as a rubbish bin it is obvious that the local government of angono lacks sincerity and political will to protect their own water resources the dumpsite is in full operation despite common knowledge that it is violating environmental laws and polluting the lake
8852319 i heard manila waters claim that it has nothing to do with the pollution in manila bay because its concession is on metro manilas eastern portion or along laguna de bay di ganun din yun saan pa ba lalabas ang maruming tubig na nasa laguna lake at pasig river but it its all the same where will the dirty water in laguna lake and the pasig river empty
8852320 we will clean the whole 198 kilometer stretch of manila bay from cavite to bataan of illegal fish pens
8852321 then we will look into the operations of factories in laguna lake and we will close down any establishment that causes pollution
8852322 i would never say that things are going well or will go well because of whats happened in the preseason i dont know what will happen well have to wait for those answers
8852323 coach blackwell started off early telling us that were the question mark and hes tired of seeing it everywhere
8852324 basically he laid it out there and said were going to answer the question thats what were trying to do
8852325 we know theyre going to come out and try to run it at us early and see how we react to it
8852326 you walk a fine line as a coach making sure theyre doing what theyre supposed to do but you dont want robots
8852327 i dont want a guy whos going to grade 100 percent every snap but doesnt make a play you want them to trust their instincts but at the same time they cant segment your defense and do their own thing
8852328 we did what we needed to do we knew we werent as bad as we played last week
8852329 we came out here and gave ourselves a little bit of confidence
8852330 we gained our step back after losing it last week
8852331 when you have a young football team any football team it doesnt have to be young the little bitty things that you learn from all the things that you know somehow some way theyre going to come back around i think tonight we learned how to bounce back from some early obstacles
8852332 we wanted to come out here and put together a couple big drives we did what we needed to do
8852333 i thought he played hard and provided a spark which is what he had to do i would like to say he played hard and added a spark and we won the game
8852334 we knew we wanted to play robert but we didnt know if we were going to start robert kirbys been through some ups and downs and we felt like he deserved the opportunity to start and we gave it to him
8852335 it was a complete team loss today from top to bottom
8852336 we didnt show up to play and it showed up
8852337 hes probably one of the fastest football players ive ever been around

8852346 we will just have to see what happens over the next couple of days we are always looking to improve the squad we have got a lot of midfielders anyway so replacing simon is not one of the main problems but we have not stopped looking for players by any means
8852347 the time was right to let simon go he was offered the security of a two year deal at york which is closer to his hometown of hull we felt it was it time to freshen things up he left with my thanks he was a good servant to the club
8852348 we are looking forward to the game they are a big strong side who have spent a lot of money on players and its going to be hard we know that but if we want to keep our run going we have to rise to the challenge
8852349 we have two tough home games over the next week teams dont come any tougher than rushden and then torquay on thursday but we have confidence now and we need to perform like we have done over the past two games

8852353 ha llegado el momento de cambiar estados unidos por eso me presento a presidente
8852354 las pol ticas fallidas de washington y la fracasada presidencia de george w bush
8852355 esta noche dijo obama le digo al pueblo estadunidense a los dem cratas y republicanos e independientes a lo largo de este gran pa s
8852356 estamos aqu porque amamos demasiado a este pa s como para intentar que los pr ximos cuatro a os no sean como los ocho ltimos
8852357 mccain no es presidente indicado para este pa s porque su labor ser una extensi n de la pol tica que bush ha desarrollado en la casa blanca durante los ltimos ocho a os
8852358 la pol tica exterior de bush y mccain ha despilfarrado el legado construido por generaciones de estadunidenses dem cratas y republicanos y nosotros nos disponemos a recomponer ese legado
8852359 mccain no se mofa de la situaci n actual de eu m s bien parece que no entiende la realidad que nos ha tocado vivir
8852360 si no dijo c mo se puede explicar que defina la clase media como la familia que ingresa m s de cinco millones de d lares al a o
8852361 con el equipamiento adecuado y con las condiciones y beneficios que se merecen
8852362 senador obama este es verdaderamente un buen d a para estados unidos
8852363 muy a menudo los xitos de nuestros rivales no son reconocidos hoy yo quiero hacer una pausa y decir enhorabuena
8852364 esta nominaci n llega en un d a hist rico dijo en referencia al 45 aniversario del c lebre discurso de luther king ma ana volveremos a la campa a electoral pero esta noche senador ha hecho un buen trabajo
8852365 obama le pondr atenci n a al y m xico
8852366 vamos a tener un presidente que le ponga atenci n a am rica latina y a m xico

8852368 they refused to tell their motives for documenting our picket program but it is clear from their actions that they intended to spy on and intimidate us
8852369 surveillance intimidation and misinformation have always been part of president gloria arsenal in confronting protesters these moves are almost always coupled with violence this dangerous concept in dealing with opposition is now being used in educational institutions arroyo is responsible for the seeping fascism in the schools
8852370 it was a huge surprise to see a tortoise on the line we get some incorrect materials coming through here but it is the first time for a tortoise
8852371 we are all pleased tom survived and the fact that the tortoise belongs to ruth jones is something else
8852372 i would like to thank all of the staff at the recycling depot at lamby way for saving tom
8852373 judging my current abilities honestly im terrible at languages i also cant deny that i have no experience or knowledge in agriculture however i want to learn together with the people of afghanistan
8852374 the killings will not stop until all foreigners leave afghanistan
8852375 although this organization makes itself useful to afghans they are spies who bring in western influence
8852376 we will kill members of any aid organization even if their country has not sent troops to afghanistan
8852377 i think we can only wait until america collapses as a country
8852378 in afghanistan the amount of people who are dying is growing of 25 million people in the country 12 million will be affected by drought 5 million are at the starvation line and 10 million are right below the starvation line and then youve got these people trying to implement male female equality or put in communication networks whats that about
8852379 q so thats how far the peshwar kai has managed to include itself in afghanistan nakamura yes afghans are very pro japanese plus we have always respected religion q religion i guess you mean islam a for the most part there has been a lot of activity that has no understanding of islam for example female equality programs which want to assert womens rights and whatnot if you try to do that out there first the women will reject it theyll think like what is this some christian prosletyzing
8852380 anybody who left their job will not be allowed to return
8852381 they have become irrelevant and cannot be trusted anymore as educators
8852382 iedereen weet dat de luchtvaartmaatschappijen het vandaag moeilijk hebben vooral de kleine maatschappijen maar ook de grote lufthansa is een van de weinige maatschappijen die deze crisis goed weet te trotseren
8852383 against portsmouth i think everyone sat up and took notice of that and wigan was one where we had to dig in a bit more against a very physical team who i think will cause a lot of problems for teams at home this year
8852384 i think its important to take a lot from both games not every game in the premier league is easy to play great flowing football in
8852385 deco has been brilliant against portsmouth he scored a great goal and then the free kick he hit the other day at wigan was a match winning moment its what you want players like him in your team for
8852386 you can never say that you are a first choice at this football club
8852387 if you start to think like that then you can just about guarantee that you are about to lose your place its a big fight to get into the team its a bigger fight to stay there
8852388 of course we have to win things that is the main objective to win something this year
8852389 but if we can do it the way we play it is even better because football is to entertain people and to take pleasure and thats what we are doing at arsenal
8852390 we graciously accepted the postponement of the tournament which is a big setback to our cricket because players raised a hue and cry over the security but it seems as if these players just dont understand the problems being faced by us
8852391 we are trying to play cricket anywhere if we organise a tournament in pakistan india west indies and sri lanka will be available to tour as they said they had no issues on playing in pakistan
8852392 india is coming to play in pakistan in january and want their players to rest due to the postponement of the ct so india can be ruled out we will be playing west indies in a bilateral three match series in november in abu dhabi so inviting them was out of question
8852393 we still have sri lanka as an option but we have asked a couple of nations to invite us in writing
8852394 we have received favourable response from one of these nations and we are awaiting the response of their sponsors for a one day series it can be a bilateral series a tri nation or even a quadrangular we dont know but we are hopeful of getting cricket next month
8852395 cricket australia does not find it necessary to send a security outfit to india on a pre inspection visit whereas india has also had problems with terrorist attacks in recent times
8852396 i think even these players know they cant afford to offend the indians because all the money now is coming from india i would also love to see graeme smiths response if india were in talks with south africa to play a series next month instead of pakistan
8852397 we do think weve got a lot of relevant products that can offset the concerns that consumers do rightly have
8852398 the network music player will be the cd player of the 21st century and squeezebox boom is the first player in its class to deliver high quality audio in a compact all in one design

8852402 the most important things are the hardest things to say
8852403 industry says its money is intended solely to keep doctors up to date critics charge that companies agree to support only classes that promote their products
8852404 i want to make sure were not marketing for industry or being influenced by their marketing
8852405 its a good plan and its a big deal that a place like stanford has adopted it
8852406 when this is all over medical education will not be the same as what its been
8852407 reforms based on transparency can foster accountability and build confidence in medical education and in turn the practice of medicine
8852408 americas pharmaceutical research companies have taken positive steps to help ensure they provide nothing but accurate and balanced information to health care providers
8852409 sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me
8852410 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8852411 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8852412 when hurt will not heal exploring the capacity to relive social and physical pain
8852413 scivee is a very creative example of the potential for cyberinfrastructure or digital information and communication technologies to add a powerful new communication and sharing dimension to science
8852414 posters are the lingua franca for conveying new science but only appear at a conference for a day or two
8852415 postercasts now make that information easily accessible and persistent for a worldwide audience
8852416 scivee has been very successful in its goal to build a community around a particular area of research thereby creating a free flow of ideas across generations as well as different professional levels
8852417 because of this difference in behavior we can track the changes with our analytical instruments
8852418 my research group is one of the few in the world to use these techniques
8852419 any differences that are detected are due to metabolism or microbial degradation
8852420 once the path of pcbs is known how they are circulating in the food web it is likely to be something that can be cleaned up with new methods and kept out of the food chain
8852421 the objective of the diagnosis and management of rhinitis an updated practice parameter is to improve the care of patients with all types of rhinitis with an emphasis on allergic rhinitis
8852422 following a thorough review of the medical literature the evidence was incorporated into this guideline thereby providing the practicing allergist an updated practical guide for the diagnosis and management of rhinitis
8852423 in recent years clinical research has significantly increased our knowledge about rhinitis treatments and new treatments have been introduced therefore an updated parameter was needed to provide new guidance for optimal rhinitis treatment
8852424 research on identity within the field of psychology should broaden its focus to include a wider unit of analysis than the solitary individual
8852425 such a focus will empower parents and educators to take a more conscious positive and active though careful role in the identity formation of youth while previously such a role may have been understood and portrayed as out of bounds
8852426 these data are exciting because they demonstrate that recombinant vlps are a valid and potent vaccine approach against influenza combined with our innovative manufacturing approach our vlp vaccine candidate has the potential to address an unmet need in pandemic influenza preparedness efforts being planned by health authorities around the world
8852427 this data milestone marks good progress in the viability of novavaxs vaccine which combined with ge healthcares ready to use bioprocessing technologies signals the promise of a solution to problems countries face in preparing for the inevitability of pandemic influenza
8852428 in the face of a global health threat innovations are required that can deliver safe and effective vaccines quickly and reliably
8852429 two doses of this novel vaccine which is designed to prevent bird flu gave strong immune responses the data are encouraging that this new vaccine approach can help prevent pandemic influenza

8852445 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8852446 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8852447 knows both the opportunities and the pitfalls and you want that experience
8852448 daschle added that obama might have to disaggregate his comprehensive health care and energy proposals to pass them piece by piece
8852449 has drawn more attention in this presidential campaign than in recent elections
8852450 political reality is that health care reform is just one of many issues on voters minds and even then expanding coverage matters less than controlling the rise in health care costs
8852451 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
8852452 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8852453 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
8852454 i am sure that regardless of results of the elections in the united states georgia has a strong friend as senator obama who knows what should do and is prepared to do his best in order to assist georgia
8852455 we speak about several kinds of assistance including political assistance concrete measures to ensure the world support with the objective not to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia and economic aid
8852456 me juggling two records at the same time can be a lot for people to handle drums on top could have been too much
8852457 the planning department has determined that the harding is a historic resource but that does not mean that the entire building has to be preserved
8852458 what the new project does have to do is convey that this is a very old theater and present that to the public the staff believes it does that
8852459 this is a vibrant neighborhood with little shops and businesses and people are in favor of fixing up the harding
8852460 otherwise its an eyesore that is just going to continue sitting there
8852461 the city has done due diligence and given the historic issues serious attention
8852462 i dont believe we can allow this building to remain derelict
8852463 the enduring integrity of the hardings dual purpose as a movie and vaudeville theater remains a prime historic characteristic of the building that sets it apart among the diminishing number of survivors from the silent movie era
8852464 further review would help determine whether the project could go forward and still preserve the stage thats the crux of the issue
8852465 the new plan should allow the building to be what it was a gathering place
8852466 the harding theater could be an anchor for the community
8852467 god is still at the helm and in the midst of the storm he just tells me to take it easy

8852482 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8852483 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know why else would he define middle class as someone making under five million dollars a year
8852484 how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans
8852485 how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize social security and gamble your retirement

8852488 almost everything about supermarket shopping in the uk is wrong for elderly customers from shelving that is too high to reach or too low to get to
8852489 the kaiser store was the first of its kind in germany and is so impressive the trolleys on their own are lighter and easier to move
8852490 its clear theyre doing everything they can to attract the elderly and its been a commercial success since it open two years ago
8852491 with a growing elderly population this has to be the future for supermarkets we have to adapt to the fact we are living in a society with more elderly people
8852492 were never going to go back to where there is a higher proportion of young people and adults
8852493 police are appealing for anyone who was in the area and has information to contact detectives
8852494 owen will not be ready as he needs recovery time as well
8852495 anyone could play against andorra but croatia is different you need players who are 100
8852496 we sent owen to the right specialist and he had the right treatment so it is just a matter of him getting on with it now
8852497 it has not been easy for him having tendinitis can be irritating for a player
8852498 but he has trained for 10 days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch
8852499 weve already started rehearsals and so far ive danced about six hours
8852500 matthew is absolutely gorgeous in every way and is such a wonderful dancer of course the pressure is on given that he won with alesha last year and she was fabulous but i will try my best not to embarrass myself or screw up i dont want to let matthew down
8852501 ill be up against people with different levels of experience in dancing and who will have more time on their hands to rehearse but im not going to think about the other contestants im just going to focus on my own performance
8852502 yes its going to be a crazy time for me but im just so excited about the prospect of being able to dance at the end of it all

8852504 ive always been a fan of the show but wouldnt know the difference between the foxtrot or the salsa but im going to give it my best and enjoy it while i try its going to be amazing
8852505 this is wonderful news for us but it is also good to know that bitterns are dispersing across the country
8852506 the bitterns are now finding new homes and that has to be good if they are not so dependent on one place
8852507 the bittern has suffered an ill fated history in the uk having endured extinction once and having been on the verge of extinction again in the late 1990s
8852508 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
8852509 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
8852510 i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8852511 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8852512 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back
8852513 financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back

8852530 turkey is our nato ally and as a friend of georgia in my view should have been more supportive of their georgian neighbors and of their american allies
8852531 and this brings back the bad taste of turkey for example barring american troops from going into iraq through turkish ports and turkish territory in 2003 a step that vastly damaged the turkish american relations id hoped we were putting that behind us
8852532 turkey is refusing us naval ships access to georgia via the black sea
8852533 its not a common practice to deliver humanitarian aid using battleships
8852534 on august 8 we were in beijing at the opening ceremony of the olympics where we met with vladimir putin at that moment he received a phone call that was the time he and i learned that georgia had attacked tskhinvali

8852542 they never say were going to cut off your oil because we dont like your foreign policy
8852543 there is a risk that they might do something like cutting oil to hurt the worlds democracies if they get angry enough
8852544 within a decade it will be very hard for russia to push us around

8852556 i really felt her absence in season three i felt that her return was important not only to my character but also to the show in general
8852557 what can i say the fans have spoken sara returns i think it was at some point during the writers strike that i started hearing rumors that sara was returning that the fans were organising write ins and petitions and i think thats emblematic of where we are in terms of television and the media its very much a back and forth conversation between the fans and the writers between the writers and the powers that be their opinions especially when expressed online or via correspondence are important and are taken into consideration

8852564 a fairly large proportion of the distinguished novels of the last few decades have been written by catholics and have even been describable as catholic novels

8852577 should people lose their homes because they have to be hospitalized
8852578 the rate for residential care is a little more than half of the nursing home rate

8852595 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words
8852596 the language center of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain

8852651 ik probeerde iets te herkennen maar zag niets die lange grijze baard dat gedraaide knotje op zijn hoofd ik kon niet geloven dat deze alternatieve genezer het alter ego van radovan karadzic was
8852652 als je niet zou weten waar hij verantwoordelijk voor is zou je hem aardig vinden
8852653 ik was er ooggetuige van dat italiaanse vredestroepen bij een controlepost met hun rug naar een servisch konvooi gingen staan dat radovan karadzic begeleidde
8852654 dat was dertien jaar geleden gelukkig is hij deze zomer gearresteerd en uitgeleverd
8852655 ik wil geen woord missen ik heb karadzic in het voorjaar van 1996 voor het laatst gesproken
8852656 ik heb gehoord dat je met een leuk servisch meisje gaat trouwen
8852657 ik ben op een zondagavond in november 1995 gebeld door iemand die bij de dayton onderhandelingen aanwezig was hij vertelde mij dat over deze kwestie werd gesproken ik heb goldstone gebeld die de volgende ochtend een persconferentie belegde waarin hij zei dat hij ontslag zou nemen als in dayton straffeloosheid zou worden beloond ik sluit niet uit dat holbrooke karadzic iets heeft beloofd maar hij zou dat nooit op papier zetten
8852658 ik heb het gezien dat is een fakedocument voor het proces maakt de vermeende holbrooke deal trouwens niets uit daar staat het vn hof buiten
8852659 een verstandig advies ik ben benaderd door een amerikaanse advocaat om ook toe te treden tot de club van adviseurs ik doe het niet want ik zou veel van mijn bosnische vrienden kwijtraken
8852660 en daarbij bestaan er talloze brieven van karadzic waarin hij het leger opdraagt om de conventies van gen ve te eerbiedigen
8852661 dat gaat gebeuren als de europese unie druk op de ketel houdt en geen genoegen neemt met alleen de uitlevering van karadzic ik bespeur die neiging europa beschikt over de diplomatieke macht om te zorgen dat mladic wordt uitgeleverd e n ding weet ik zeker de militaire veiligheidsdienst van servi weet waar hij zit

8852665 through this trade fair local enterprises should make new contacts and forge partnerships with the international exhibitors present in this fair
8852666 this provides a wider scope of business which also increases the profitability of a company family based and individual businesses fetch less profit
8852667 there should always be interplay between government and the private sector and a clear link between business and policy should exist
8852668 the most laudable feat is the opening of regional borders on a 24 hour basis which will cut transportation costs and hence increase business flow
8852669 i have gathered some information from the time i came to rwanda its quite clear that there are no clear cut building regulations and standards and there are big gaps in the professional capacity of engineers quantity surveyors and craftsmen to do the work
8852670 we have already documented the codes and standards to guide the construction practice courtesy of bsi in this we are very committed to ensuring peoples safety and professionalizing the construction industry in rwanda
8852671 most of the building materials are imported there is going to be strict screening of these materials so that second grade materials are not used in construction
8852672 we shall make sure that there is strict supervision at all levels starting from the initial stage to the end of construction and samples of materials will have to first be tested in the laboratory to ensure quality
8852673 the meeting brings together all member countries and people from various fields in the police force and technical departments such as law and justice to look at the progress in ways of joint police cooperation in dealing with crimes such as arms smuggling and drugs
8852674 the pilot trial was aimed at establishing the feasibility of the one laptop per child project whether it can succeed or not as well as identifying the requirements of the project before a large scale deployment in all primary schools of rwanda
8852675 the children appreciated the education content especially due to the fact that the computers are packaged with comprehensive content on geography science and the english language which has improved their vocabulary
8852676 some students pointed out that the laptops are very important because they have given them the opportunity to teach their parents since they go home with the computers
8852677 after distribution we are planning to take two days in a week to carry out the second phase of training the teachers of the schools given the laptops at their respective schools
8852678 this year the package is much better which means better organization better prizes for top performers and winners and a better all round tournament

8852680 we came to mtn because it is one of the biggest institutions in the country that will participate in the forth coming elections
8852681 the general public needs to be aware of why they have to vote its importance and the benefits that come with a voting public
8852682 employees in both the public and private sector are too busy to follow tv and radio programs that are very informative on the elections
8852683 seventy percent of our employees attended the meeting which is something rare
8852684 this implies that great awareness has been created among the employees
8852685 we are happy that students have appreciated and shown interest in taking part in the eac which i think will be of great value to them
8852686 we are for the government and we are happy that we joined the eac we are ready to work hand in hand with it so as to boost the economic development of our economy

8852689 the eastern africa region is one that has been plagued with conflicts and calamities existing conflicts such as those in the horn of africa darfur the presence of threats to uganda rwanda and burundi in eastern congo are clear examples of the need to have a robust peace and security mechanism
8852690 also incorporated in the plan is the development of a force support system capable of sustaining regional capabilities
8852691 i think it was a good idea for kgbs to secure a collaborating deal with the mtn
8852692 we mtn emphasis more on cultural and social activities such as music and sports and education because we believe they can easily create a positive change to the societys development
8852693 we dont intend to stop on the kgb but the company is also intending to support the entire local music industry to greater heights

8852705 we are really happy that the school decided to put on this event to bring everyone together
8852706 it seems like a great way to socialize and see whats going on
8852707 and its a great chance to catch up with friends
8852708 it was great because it gave me the chance to take a much needed break from work
8852709 we want to make it more an afternoon event so there is more time for people to mingle around

8852727 sean is one of the best young distance coaches in the country and will help our program both athletically and academically
8852728 i hope we improve with each meet and have success both individually and as a team
8852729 i feel it is important to have athletes who bring something more to the table than just their talent on the track
8852730 for people who dont know me im a coach that cares both on and off the field about each individual
8852731 its been very tough not only is he one of my coaches hes one of my best personal friends
8852732 it hits hard when its someone youre close to everyday
8852733 on the field hes making sure were doing something right off the field hes the guy you go talk to
8852734 hes focused on not only fighting his cancer but doing as much as he can in helping this football program
8852735 he told us to not let any challenges hold you back
8852736 more than 40 percent of college students who reported at least one symptom of alcohol abuse or dependence
8852737 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
8852738 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8852739 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8852740 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8852741 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8852742 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8852743 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8852744 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8852745 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8852746 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative

8852753 the mobile platform has regularly been considered an inferior platform to the pc since the launch of mobile data services but these results clearly show that this is not the case especially in terms of one of the key drivers of firm profitability loyalty
8852754 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8852755 in washington they call this the ownership society but what that really means is youre on your own

8852758 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

8852768 its like youve been slapped so hard in the past that you can almost still feel it i just know how much work it was rebuilding everything

8852773 a high school counselor told me about it i always liked science and math and it seemed like a great opportunity
8852774 its more competitive today to get into your college of choice than ever before
8852775 unfortunately its just something thats become necessary if you want to get ahead
8852776 to get accepted into some schools the competition is so steep and they have to decide if thats worth the price
8852777 i think some of the creativity gets kind of drilled out of them
8852778 its a lot of hours its intense we have homework
8852779 my parents are kind of making me but i know it will be totally worthwhile when i take the sat
8852780 the jump is because high school students are starting earlier to work on their college degree
8852781 theyre very ambitious they seem to have a much clearer vision of what they are going to do with their lives than my peers did when i was in high school they know where they want to go they know where they want to be and they know what theyre going to do to reach those goals its really impressive

8852787 there can be no further delay in respect to a drop in the official cash rate
8852788 the weak result reflects a final bout of mortgage rate increases clashing with sharply higher fuel and food bills
8852789 budgeted sales levels are well down on expectations and that runs the clear risk of the next step being a shedding of labour in the industry
8852790 the imminent move to lower interest rates is a welcome first step to a much needed home building recovery but the delay to a tangible boost to construction activity will be significant

8852793 i have experienced the benefits of outsourcing my business accounting and tax functions to a qualified cpa certified public accountant
8852794 a book keeper may be cheaper but a cpa will be worth the while in the long run my cpa apart from keeping the accounts had also been able to advise on areas such as cpf changes simple tax matters as part of client management an unqualified book keeper will not be able to do this
8852795 there is a need to find a solution and that would be to sit down listen to one another and understand each others point of view if we kill them militants they are not going to let us go they will come and kill us
8852796 sit with them militants talk to them ask them what they want nothing can ever be resolved through fighting issues can only be resolved though negotiations
8852797 nothing lasts forever no totalitarian system or hard power and no perverse ideology is powerful enough to destroy the natural human wish of freedom
8852798 i was filming at the time and i heard someone shouting its a bomb run away when i ran a few paces the bomb exploded one journalist was killed and my body was thrown against something i saw someones body on fire and then someone took us to hospital
8852799 as we have changed our system of harvesting now we are producing better quality salt which i hope will meet the countrys demand we were collecting salt before with local traditional ways now we are using polythene sheets in our fields to get clean salts with good quality but our farmers are not getting a good price because at the border salt is coming to our land illegally from myanmar

8852806 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8852807 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8852808 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8852809 die vorliegende steuerreformkonzeption kn pft auch an das bestehende steuergesetz an das unter den gesichtspunkten der internationalen wettbewerbs und leistungsf higkeit weiterentwickelt wurde
8852810 dabei wurden auch anforderungen wie attraktivit t der besteuerung europarechtliche und internationale kompatibilit t sowie steuergerechtigkeit und einfachheit der handhabung ber cksichtigt
8852811 die integration von verm gens und erwerbssteuer erlauben es den bisherigen vergleichsweise komplex ausgestalteten progressionszuschlag sowie den alleinerziehenden oder den verheiratetenabzug durch angepasste abzugs und freibetr ge und einen f nf stufen tarif zu ersetzen und damit deutlich zu vereinfachen
8852812 nicht nur die lebenserwartung ist signifikant gestiegen seit 1980 um 5 jahre sondern auch die markanten z suren wie heirats geb ralter oder scheidungsraten unterliegen einem gravierenden ver nderungsprozess die lebensl ufe sind variabler und unsicherer geworden wir sprechen in diesem zusammenhang von einer destandardisierung der lebensphasen
8852813 der wunsch nach finanzieller unabh ngigkeit sowie die steigenden scheidungsraten tragen dazu bei dass lebensversicherungen zunehmend als single polizze abgeschlossen werden
8852814 die erste s ule dient lediglich der grundversorgung da tun sich erhebliche vorsorgel cken auf

8852817 man sollte sich wirklich gut berlegen bei der nationalratswahl f r die sp zu stimmen wer beweise daf r braucht muss nur nach wien schauen trotz einer geb hren und mieterh hung nach der anderen sind die gemeindebauten in einem desolaten zustand verantwortlich daf r ist der wohnbaustadtrat und das war bis 2006 werner faymann
8852818 jeder kaufmann der so eine preispolitik f hrt landet wegen wucher vor dem kadi aber dem roten wien kann nichts passieren da ist das ganz normal sozialpolitik a la faymann und co eben
8852819 zeigen sie mir einen konsumenten der davon profitiert hat zeigen sie mir ein gasthaus das seine preise aufgrund dieses urteils gesenkt hat
8852820 es muss schluss sein mit dieser schuldenpolitik diesem teufelskreis aus wahlversprechen und darauffolgenden steuererh hungen diese politik der verantwortungslosigkeit reicht uns in wien wir brauchen sie nicht auch noch auf bundesebene

8852822 die bekleidungslieferungen aus sterreich sind allein im zeitraum 1 3 2008 um 14 auf 17 mio euro gewachsen
8852823 russland liegt bereits an sechster stelle im exportranking von bekleidungslieferungen aus sterreich
8852824 der schwerpunkt liegt bei dob lieferungen aber auch w sche haka und sportbekleidung werden exportiert
8852825 im vergangenen jahr ist die russische wirtschaft wiederum und zwar um zirka 8 gewachsen der wachstumstrend wird 2008 mit ca 7 7 anhalten
8852826 der steigende andrang westeurop ischer bekleidungsanbieter wird aber vor allem im mittleren genre eine weitere intensivierung des wettbewerbes zur folge haben
8852827 sterreich ist mittlerweile nach italien deutschland und frankreich viertgr ter lieferant aus dem eu raum nach russland
8852828 die exportentwicklung in relation russland zeigt dass die vom fachverband der bekleidungsindustrie im kooperation mit der awo wko rechtzeitig und vorausschauend gesetzten aktivit ten ein positiver beitrag zur erschlie ung eines bedeutsamen absatzmarktes mit zukunft sind
8852829 ab 1 september 2008 wird eine langj hrige forderung des clubs zumindest teilweise umgesetzt in gewerblichen autobussen zur sch lerbef rderung muss f r jedes kind ein sitzplatz zur verf gung stehen
8852830 auch in linienbussen muss jedem kind ein vollwertiger platz zur verf gung stehen au erdem sollten f r kinder spezielle sitze mit gurten vorhanden sein
8852831 dieser missstand muss endlich beseitigt werden denn auch in taxis ist man vor unf llen nicht gefeit
8852832 eine ausnahme f r taxis ist hier v llig fehl am platz und st t bei der bev lkerung auf unverst ndnis der gesetzgeber sollte daf r sorgen dass kinder in allen fahrzeugen nur gesichert bef rdert werden d rfen
8852833 it is not the worst draw we could have had
8852834 our main issue will be the travel porto is not too bad but kiev and fenerbahce are long trips that is the real issue for us
8852835 i dont think we have got it easy or we have a hard draw it is in the middle with the problem of the distance of course
8852836 we look forward to meeting oleg again i remember being there in kiev when we bought him he always did well for us and gave us 100
8852837 they were my favourites for the tournament after they beat us in 1998 but perhaps they are not as strong as they were
8852838 fenerbahce are not going to be easy they have great local support the team will have to contend with the atmosphere as well playing the team while porto were champions in 2004 so they cannot be underestimated
8852839 die europ ische union ben tigt keine belehrungen von pr sident saakaschwili wie sie sich gegen ber russland zu verhalten hat besser w re es gewesen dieser h tte sich an die ratschl ge der europ er und brigens auch der usa gehalten und keinen unn tigen krieg angefangen
8852840 anstatt die s dosseten die in der vergangenheit viele unangenehme erfahrungen mit dem georgischen nationalismus gemacht haben vom verbleib in georgien zu berzeugen wurden sie immer mehr in die h nde der russen getrieben
8852841 aggressive politik gegen ber georgien und die unterst tzung von ethnisch motivierten vertreibungen in den besetzten gebieten verantwortet hat
8852842 russland kann nicht erwarten dass die olympischen spiele in sotschi erfolgreich und unter der teilnahme der europ er verlaufen wenn es nicht zur stabilit t und frieden in der region beitr gt sondern weiter eine politik der instabilit t und der missachtung der grunds tze des internationalen rechts betreibt insofern muss sich russland entscheiden ob es die spiele zu einem erfolg oder zum scheitern bringen m chte
8852843 die land und forstwirtschaft ist der einzige sektor der volkswirtschaft der ber die pflanzen und den boden wesentlich mehr klimagase bindet als er erzeugt denn pflanzen brauchen zum wachstum co2 und erzeugen dabei sauerstoff selbst die als klimas nder viel gescholtene kuh bilanziert positiv denn sie lebt nicht von fossilen sondern von nachwachsenden rohstoffen wie gras mais oder getreide und diese pflanzen binden deutlich mehr co2 als die kuh an verdauungsgasen erzeugt insgesamt stehen den emissionen der land und forstwirtschaft von 8 mio t co2 quivalent im jahr etwa eine bindungswirkung von 58 mio t co2 beziehungsweise co2 quivalent gegen ber das zeigt dass die klimabilanz der landwirtschaft hoch positiv ausf llt
8852844 wer in diversen studien die landwirtschaft als klimas nder hinstellen will deren umwelt leistung jedoch zu erw hnen vergisst der spielt einzig der erd l und erdgas lobby in die h nde
8852845 es gibt nur zwei m glichkeiten den klimawandel effektiv zu beeinflussen die eine ist die verringerung des aussto es von klimasch dlichen gasen die andere die erh hung der schadstoffbindung die bindung von co2 erfolgt beim wachstum von getreide von anderer biomasse beispielsweise f r die energiegewinnung oder von holz die einzige m glichkeit langfristig noch mehr klimagase zu binden ist eine funktionst chtige und effiziente land und forstwirtschaft
8852846 wenn wir eine klimadebatte f hren dann verlangt die landwirtschaft eine umfassende und vor allem objektive betrachtung der fakten denn nur darauf kann eine vern nftige strategie zur erreichung von klimazielen aufbauen einseitige darstellungen und unausgewogene schlussfolgerungen werden von der lk sterreich abgelehnt
8852847 wer diese einfachen regeln beachtet kann unangenehme und gesch ftssch digende missverst ndnisse vermeiden wir stehen unseren kunden bei bedarf aber nat rlich auch f r ein interkulturelles intensiv coaching zur verf gung
8852848 the operation has been extremely expensive so we will have to balance the domestic pressures on the one hand and pressures in somalia on the other and try to come up with a balanced solution
8852849 we didnt anticipate that the international community would be happy riding the ethiopian horse and flogging it at the same time for so long
8852850 when it was decided the block was to be demolished our investment became worthless and it was obvious that we should be compensated
8852851 this is a very big flat and i was asking for around 250 000 as compensation for all the hassle we have had
8852852 they offered 165 000 which would not have bought anything in this area
8852853 we are left living in a place where we look like squatters it is really depressing my kids are accused of being squatters at school
8852854 we cant invite people back here because we are too embarrassed with the way things are
8852855 and you live in fear of one of the empty flats being set on fire
8852856 i know it was never the warren in caversham here but it was a perfectly okay place to live when i moved here
8852857 now there is graffiti all over the walls and it looks like a squat
8852858 we also had two years of protracted negotiations with the two leaseholders about what they felt was adequate compensation for giving up their flats
8852859 we finally reached an agreement with them that any redevelopment of the site would include building two family size houses they could move into
8852860 unfortunately all the delays meant that by this time the housing market had turned extremely unstable with house prices and land values falling and a few months ago this company also withdrew from the deal
8852861 we are as frustrated as residents about the situation but unfortunately it doesnt seem that any private developer is interested in helping us redevelop the site in the current climate

8852872 my reasons for leaving were not economic nor were they for family reasons it was homophobia
8852873 before i came out in 2002 the rumours about my sexuality already had huge ramifications on my life
8852874 i was a pastor in the latvian church i wrote a column in the church newspaper which was stopped my weekly radio sermon was taken off air and i was kicked out of the cathedral i worked in
8852875 in may 2002 i was ex communicated from the church back then there were only three openly gay people in latvia
8852876 my story was on the front pages of all the latvian newspapers and i have suffered dozens of personal attacks since then
8852877 i have been verbally abused spat at and physically attacked
8852878 last year two men ambushed me as i went to baptise a child
8852879 since then my sight started to deteriorate which my doctors blame on the stress caused by the attacks

8852885 my first step will be to bring the dog around my dog will indicate to me if theres cat scent in the area
8852886 ive never met the cat that says oh great heres the search dog im finally saved what theyll do is sometimes theyll slip away and i dont want to get into a chase situation so ill set up a humane trap where that scent was so when we leave the area the cat typically will come back to where he or she was comfortable
8852887 our neighbours were thinking we were crazy because we had a woman with a big vest and jacket on and a dog on a leash looking and sniffing all around
8852888 it wasnt far but he was a cat that wouldnt have gone to anybody
8852889 i think he probably would have died under there to tell you the truth because if anyone tried to help him out he would have stayed put he would have been too scared
8852890 she came with her little dog and within 10 minutes the cat was found and everything was hunky dory
8852891 we used to call it shadow because you could never find it
8852892 im not going to look for a skittish cat in the same way that im going to look for the super friendly guy thats not afraid of anything
8852893 i thought it would be a delightful thing to offer here because theres just nobody who can really help you
8852894 i have an 80 per cent success rate so 20 per cent of them i just cannot find theres times when i felt so close yet so far that can be really hard on you
8852895 sometimes within just a few minutes we can locate the cat and they just think were amazing
8852896 you go into afghanistan you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didnt wear a veil bluemaks system specs

8852898 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8852899 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight on nov
8852900 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8852901 they had indicated at the time that they were doing it selling dollar drinks because they had to keep up with the competition
8852902 its going to bring unfortunately increased drinking in the downtown which may cause a few more problems
8852903 were opposed to deeply discounted drink prices at bars downtown as far as were concerned they encourage binge drinking and excessive intoxication and they lead to increased calls for service to us in the downtown area
8852904 we see more fights we see more intoxication and general disorder
8852905 it appears that legislation is the only way that this can work
8852906 that committees report is currently under consideration for further action
8852907 its too potent kids arent used to drinking that kind of stuff

8852910 he understood that to truly fulfil our national dream we must accept the challenges and seize the opportunities presented by our north
8852911 as prime minister diefenbaker said as he stood here in 1961 there is a new world emerging above the arctic circle
8852912 hes certainly the liberal leader who has taken his party farthest to the left since mr trudeau if not farther than mr trudeau
8852913 the fact that mr dion opposes any expenditure management in any area of government indicates to us obviously why we have increasingly little common ground in parliament with mr dion and where he is taking the liberal party but more importantly it indicates a direction for the country that i dont think canadians are prepared to accept
8852914 were not saying we dont welcome more federal infrastructure military development
8852915 if were not going to get our kids through school the involvement of inuit in economic development will continue to be slow
8852916 they had indicated at the time that they were doing it selling dollar drinks because they had to keep up with the competition
8852917 its going to bring unfortunately increased drinking in the downtown which may cause a few more problems
8852918 were opposed to deeply discounted drink prices at bars downtown as far as were concerned they encourage binge drinking and excessive intoxication and they lead to increased calls for service to us in the downtown area
8852919 we see more fights we see more intoxication and general disorder
8852920 it appears that legislation is the only way that this can work
8852921 that committees report is currently under consideration for further action
8852922 its too potent kids arent used to drinking that kind of stuff
8852923 it may be better to increase the price after that
8852924 i know when youre young you want to go out and have a good time and buy cheap drinks

8852935 we thought we were stopping in halifax for 45 minutes and ended up sitting in the aircraft on the tarmac for about seven hours
8852936 many people got to hotels only to find out there were no rooms and had to go downtown
8852937 we were prepared to allow the flight to continue on its way
8852938 it was a dispute between the airline and the ground services provider
8852939 the collapse of zoom is a result of matters beyond our control
8852940 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8852941 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8852942 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8852943 what were the chances of travelling on one of the historic last flights of zoom airlines

8852953 nach drei gro en windw rfen innerhalb von 14 monaten dem neuerlichen markanten preisverfall beim s gerundholz und einer deutlichen abschw chung der konjunktur macht sich unter den waldbesitzern eine gewisse ern chterung breit die erwartungen dass sich der holzmarkt bis zum jahresende substanziell bessert sind ged mpft es besteht aber die hoffnung dass sp testens im fr hjahr 2009 mit beginn der bausaison wieder eine normalisierung des holzflusses eintritt wir sehen einen kleinen lichtschein am ende des tunnels dieser tunnel ist aber noch sehr sehr lange

8852985 what to do about the prospect of a nuclear iran however is another question one that has exposed a stark generational divide within the iranian jewish community
8852986 older iranian jewish immigrants who were born and raised in iran and care about the welfare of iran and iranians realize that an attack on iran will only be a temporary fix while american jews of iranian descent who are now in their 20s or early 30s are no longer iranian
8852987 theyre american jews who care about israel and think that a pre emptive attack by israel or the united states is a good idea
8852988 still others like george haroonian a former president of the council of iranian american jewish organizations who has long advocated speaking out against the iranian regime had no problem discussing the matter
8852989 if it comes down to it id rather see israel bomb a couple nuclear reactors than see iran bomb israel
8852990 with respect to the conflict between israel and iran i have no connection whatsoever to the land of iran i have no conflict or worry with respect to how it might end for the iranian nation
8852991 i have a very strong allegiance to israel on the other hand

8853007 i did have a nose job because of the bullying because they made me feel so embarrassed and ashamed and ugly and hideous about it

8853017 at first we thought he was joking but then we saw a bomb in his right hand
8853018 we kept our distance because we were really scared of him i told him to put down the bomb but he refused i took the bomb from his hand and threw it away it didnt do anything
8853019 the whole time morn was speaking with a weird voice almost like the jokers voice in the dark kinight batman film

8853023 i just think the country is divided theyre not to the far left and not to the far right theyre at the centre and i think thats what barack obamas got to do he has to convince them that hes going to lead from the centre and address many of the problems that the bush administration has brought on over the last eight years

8853043 det er positivt og sv rt interessant at hvem som helst kan publisere p wikipedia men jeg har ikke helt sansen for at man kan v re anonym det svekker noe grunnleggende ved etteretteligheten jeg har ikke selv noe sterkt forhold til wikipedia bruker det av og til selv men da med et kritisk blikk
8853044 har ikke gjort det det burde jeg kanskje begynne med
8853045 jeg er tilhenger av bruke tid p formidling s gjerne jeg kan ogs tenke meg at dette kan v re en interessant sjanger for studenter i s fall kan vi trekke dette inn i veiledning av studenter
8853046 man kan og b r ikke p legge forskere publisere i wikipedia og slik som dette fungerer n kan vi ikke registrere dette p noen m te vi kan likevel oppfordre ansatte til bidra p sine spesialomr der fra tid til annen
8853047 jeg ser ikke noe poeng i v re for eller i mot wikipedia er der allerede sp rsm let er snarere hvordan det utvikler seg videre som kunnskapsressurs synes jeg wikipedia b de har gode og d rlige sider men det viktigste er at det brukes med kritisk sans
8853048 artikkelen er brukbar p det biografiske materialet teksten har spr kproblemer noe virker oversatt det er ogs en del un yaktigheter og i tillegg finner jeg noe upresist og til dels feilaktig spr kbruk
8853049 haast nooit heb ik het gevoel dat ik het goed doe

8853051 ik weet niet wat ik aan moet met de problemen van de kinderen
8853052 ik ben niet in staat de kinderen een gevoel van zekerheid en liefde te geven

8853057 het kasteel bewaren voor de toekomst is niet echt een last maar de verantwoordelijkheid kan me soms wel benauwen
8853058 veel van de engelse koningen hebben hier wel een keer gegeten
8853059 koning edward ii heeft op dit kasteel gevangengezeten en is hier in 1327 vermoord
8853060 hij trouwde in het geheim met een eenvoudig meisje uit de buurt mary cole ze was de dochter van een handelsman ze kregen kinderen de oudste zoon werd als de erfgenaam gezien een aantal jaar later trouwde hij opnieuw met haar maar nu officieel toen begon het getouwtrek want waren de eerste kinderen nu wel of niet wettig uiteindelijk werd het eerste huwelijk niet erkend door de rechter de eerste zeven kinderen kregen een buitenechtelijke status niet de oudste zoon maar hun achtste kind werd de echte opvolger en erfgenaam de zesde graaf berkeley de oudste zoon moest het doen met de lagere adellijke titel van baron
8853061 daarvoor moesten ze eeuwen terug in de stamboom en vanaf daar weer naar boven een oud familiedocument schrijft namelijk voor dat de vererving van het kasteel alleen in de mannelijke lijn kan
8853062 de titel kwam pas in de familie na de aftakking van onze stamboomtak
8853063 zij kon niet hier komen wonen en ik kon niet in amerika gaan leven het was bijzonder verdrietig maar het zou niet zijn gegaan
8853064 het is niet echt een last maar de verantwoordelijkheid kan me soms wel benauwen
8853065 we leggen nu elk jaar een ton toe op het kasteel het aantal bezoekers loopt terug dat moet natuurlijk veranderen
8853066 we bieden ruimte aan voor bruiloften bedrijfspresentaties filmopnamen en conferenties om meer bezoekers te trekken organiseren we spannende rondleidingen voor kinderen zo zoeken we naar nieuwe mogelijkheden
8853067 in 2006 hebben wij een noodkreet geslaakt uit onderzoek van de monumentenstichting bleek dat het kasteel hard aan een grote onderhoudsbeurt toe is die kost 5 miljoen pond
8853068 het is lastig om fondsen los te krijgen de olympische spelen van 2012 zuigen al het geld op
8853069 hier op de vloer zit een roodachtige vlek volgens de overlevering is daar eeuwen geleden een nar tijdens een van zijn kunsten te pletter gevallen
8853070 veel schilderijen zouden gerestaureerd moeten worden maar daar ontbreken de middelen voor een paar doeken zijn wel opgeknapt musea die een schilderij willen lenen krijgen het gratis in bruikleen onder voorwaarde dat zij het gerestaureerd terugbezorgen
8853071 ik kon niet meer tegen al het geweld dat ik zag
8853072 ik m t gewoon weten hoe het met mijn landgenoten is
8853073 kijk daar staat weer zon russische tank die zou al lang het land uit moeten zijn
8853074 ik ben nederlander maar blijf toch ook altijd georgi r ik voel me daar thuis
8853075 eerst mochten we niet verder reizen maar omdat we aandrongen lieten ze ons toch verder gaan we zagen de eerste russische vliegtuigen het werden er steeds meer ze lieten bommen los na iedere bom ontstond een zwarte wolk de aarde trilde mensen gilden ze begonnen te rennen alle kanten op want niemand wist waar de volgende bom zou vallen
8853076 huizen stonden in brand de eerste mensen die waren gedood lagen zomaar op straat helemaal verkoold
8853077 ik zie het zo weer voor me het beeld van een opa die had geprobeerd uit zijn tractor te komen maar tijdens die poging was geraakt door geweervuur zijn handen waren nog tegen de ramen gedrukt
8853078 ik denk dat ik in een soort shock raakte misschien ook omdat het me heel erg deed denken aan vroeger toen er een burgeroorlog woedde het maakte me niet meer uit of de bommen me zouden raken of niet dat het voor mij ook gevaarlijk was drong helemaal niet tot me door het was net alsof ik naar een oorlogsfilm keek en niet besefte dat dit echt was het enige wat ik dacht was wat kan ik doen ik wilde helpen iets betekenen voor de mensen
8853079 we hebben in totaal zon acht mensen laten instappen en naar de hoofdstad gebracht waar wij die nacht geslapen hadden er was daar een oud leegstaand weeshuis het was onbewoonbaar verklaard maar de mensen hadden zo tenminste weer een dak boven hun hoofd familie van mijn vriend ontfermde zich over hen van het spaargeld dat ik nog in georgi op de bank had staan heb ik matrassen gekocht en eten drinken en wc papier ondertussen gingen we weer op weg om mensen op te halen
8853080 ik kom zo weer terug ik ga eerst je moeder halen
8853081 ik vraag me af of ik die beelden ooit weer kwijtraak mensen liepen massaal over de autoweg totaal ontredderd ze hoefden helemaal niks te zeggen je kon de angst het verdriet en de onzekerheid zo van hun gezichten aflezen het was goed dat we hen naar een plek brachten waar ze met anderen die hetzelfde hadden meegemaakt over hun ervaringen konden praten twee mannen hadden een vriend begraven op dezelfde dag dat hij was overleden dat is totaal ongebruikelijk in een land waar na een overlijden eerst zeven dagen wordt gerouwd maar ze konden niet anders een vrouw vertelde dat ze niet alleen haar man was kwijtgeraakt maar ook alle fotos waar hij op stond
8853082 we zagen russische soldaten die hun armen omhoogstaken ten teken dat ze overwonnen hadden absurd gewoon want ze hadden alleen maar dood en verderf gezaaid in een land waar ze helemaal niks te zoeken hadden nee ik haat de russen niet zij kunnen er ook weinig aan doen dat ze leiders hebben die angst willen zaaien en hun macht willen laten gelden
8853083 god heeft het zo gewild hij heeft mij elf jaar geleden naar nederland geleid en me hier een veilig bestaan gegeven nu is het blijkbaar tijd voor me om me voor georgi in te zetten want dat is wat ik nu wil doen ik heb een opleiding voor maatschappelijk werker afgerond ik denk dat ik in georgi echt wat kan betekenen kinderen moeten verwerken wat ze hebben meegemaakt ze moeten weer afleiding hebben kunnen spelen ouderen moeten een ruimte krijgen waar ze met elkaar kunnen praten alle ellende een plek kunnen geven want pas daarna kunnen ze verder met hun leven dat is wat ik zelf ook heb ervaren
8853084 die gaf me een lijst van organisaties en tips voor het zelf oprichten van een stichting
8853085 maar veel kunnen wij als bedrijf niet ondernemen het zijn meestal de gemeenten die beheerder zijn van de schuilhokjes zij zorgen dat de schade wordt hersteld
8853086 de laatste details moeten nog geregeld worden maar we zijn heel blij dat dit eindelijk afgerond geraakt

8853095 they tell me you are sending me to earth tomorrow but how am i going to live there being so small and helpless
8853096 among the many angels i chose one for you she will be waiting for you and will take care of you
8853097 here in heaven i dont do anything else but sing and smile thats enough for me to be happy
8853098 your angel will sing for you and will also smile for you every day and you will feel your angels love and be happy
8853099 and how am i going to be able to understand when people talk to me if i dont know the language that men talk
8853100 your angel will tell you the most beautiful and sweet words you will ever hear and with much patience and care your angel will teach you how to speak
8853101 and what am i going to do when i want to talk to you lord
8853102 your angel will place your hands together and will teach you how to pray
8853103 but i will always be sad because i will not see you anymore
8853104 your angel will always talk to you about me and will teach you the way for you to come back to me even though i will always be next to you
8853105 oh god if i am about to leave now please tell me my angels name
8853106 but what i will not do is suggest that the senator john mccain takes his positions for political purposes because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8853107 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination passions fly on immigration but i dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts american wages by hiring illegal workers this too is part of americas promise the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort
8853108 for 18 long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result you have shown what history teaches us that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from washington change comes to washington change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time america this is one of those moments
8853109 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8853110 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
8853111 sen mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game
8853112 in the aftermath of the global credit crisis which is still continuing and when liquidity is still tight and the pricing continues to go up this was another demonstration by emirates nbd to be aggressive in the syndicated corporate loans segment
8853113 the major challenge for us is to choose the right kind of credit and the right kind of borrower to sell in the market

8853130 college campuses have also served an important role in promoting podcasts many colleges and universities now provide podcasts of various lecture series and important speakers on campus
8853131 some professors are experimenting with podcasts in other ways such as producing their own podcasts or having their students respond to readings and lessons by creating podcasts rather than or in addition to traditional papers

8853151 although 4 000 policemen have been deployed in kandhamal district which is the worst hit hindu and christian rioters have clashed in several places we have arrested at least 137 people in the district since saturday
8853152 as per our estimate 10 000 christian families have fled to the forests after their houses were burnt and they were attacked by rioters over 4 000 people have been injured and more than 20 000 houses have been burnt
8853153 it is an emotional and spontaneous reaction of people to the killing of swami laxamanananda saraswati

8853220 es wird nicht leicht werden aber wir haben heute einen guten rhythmus gefunden wir werden sehen was m glich ist
8853221 we play what we love and we love to play for people who like what we like
8853222 even people who dont we like to win them over thats why we play a lot of obscure places if nobody wants us in a club were going to find a place to play
8853223 recording was a bit of a chore for us in other bands that we had been in and we wanted to just go through some stuff rather than hang on to it for years and years to tweak it
8853224 we thought wed bring in some guys we know and have different guests sit in with us but the first two we brought in just stayed it stopped being a project and became a band instead
8853225 i was a janitor on campus and i was cleaning the room that toms band was practicing in
8853226 the drummer hadnt shown up drummers are flaky people so i was in there cleaning and they were sitting around waiting for this guy to show up and i said you mind if i sit down and play and i did for about 10 15 minutes and then i went back to work
8853227 we like to record so were writing songs to fit the genre that we wanted to play songs that we would feel good playing simple songs
8853228 were kind of old fashioned and romantic in the way we look at being part of a group
8853229 wed like to belong somewhere we feel like we sit on the outskirts of americana music were not really a rock band and were not really a country band were just something else in there
8853230 while were not out of the woods yet maybe were beginning to see some sunlight
8853231 at some point the market will begin to look through the trough and gauge the strength of the coming upturn
8853232 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8853233 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas
8853234 but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8853235 there are a lot of aspects that look like a right wing think tank im very worried about that possibility
8853236 people are concerned about the blurring of the line between friedmans technical work in economics and his fairly well known persona as a political advocate of a very pure free market conservative or neoliberal position where the market is the solution to everything
8853237 donors will receive reports and attend lectures but they wont belong to the institute
8853238 they will have nothing to do with its direction and no economist worth their salt would take that kind of direction anyway we will bring in people from all over the world with all different approaches

8853240 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8853241 motorized bicycles and motorcycles have just exploded in popularity because gas prices are so high
8853242 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8853243 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8853244 to build this water plant the taxpayers are getting soaked

8853247 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

8853249 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8853250 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8853251 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8853252 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8853253 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8853254 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8853255 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8853256 the vehicle could not enter the gate and exploded when security people fired on it
8853257 expectations for instantaneous results i think are probably a little bit too high
8853258 i came away from the meeting very encouraged that the focus is where it needs to be
8853259 working with ibm we believe we can deliver substantial cost savings and offer the business a security solution that is both strong and sustainable
8853260 traditionally businesses have tended to deploy multiple small point security solutions sometimes provided by multiple vendors
8853261 while that model worked pretty well for a long time i think business infrastructures are getting complicated enough that approaching security from a single vendor point of view makes a lot of sense for many enterprises
8853262 while large pools of capital continue to be available in canada to qualified buyers of commercial real estate investments lenders today are much more stringent in their lending requirements than they were in the past

8853302 the idea came from our analysis of the tar pit last year
8853303 we found that many students utilized the seating directly surrounding the band the most and this move will add more seating around the band which will be directly in the center of the tar pit
8853304 the movement of the tar pit is crucial in the sense that the students will be right behind the goal posts placing them in a prominent position for acknowledgement and media coverage
8853305 they will be highly covered as well as presented with a full field view which the athletic department is hoping will stimulate student spirit
8853306 many people offer that football will always be secondary here at carolina due to our basketball success and publicity
8853307 we in the caa disagree we are altering our ability to support the team and coach davis in the best way possible we will be the 12th man on the field for the tar heels
8853308 we want the architecture of this campus to be very forward looking but we always want people to know theyre on carolinas campus
8853309 my concern today and from the beginning has been about the process of building this building
8853310 due diligence has not yet been done to determine what this campus is going to be
8853311 it will not launch a style design or concept that has yet to be discussed by this board
8853312 i really question how the first version of this building got to the board in the first place
8853313 i imagine there will be a lot of interesting conversations moving forward about how the campus should look
8853314 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8853315 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8853316 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions
8853317 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8853318 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8853319 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8853320 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8853321 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8853322 we didnt bring the group here to operate in a similar environment we brought them in to operate in the academic environment
8853323 much of the work at dice is going to be multi institutional
8853324 we felt it was actually going to be good for them
8853325 this will open up more of the digital library kinds of collaborations
8853326 were excited to have this very well respected world renowned group here
8853327 we look forward to some exciting collaborations with the dice group and with sils in general
8853328 that will allow us to raise our own sights and our own expectations of our own abilities
8853329 it sounds like a lot of work but its a lot of fun work
8853330 a lot of my friends have rushed or joined and i know theyve enjoyed it
8853331 i wouldnt want to look back and realize i missed out on an amazing opportunity
8853332 we look forward to having our panhellenic community grow with new members
8853333 in the old model people were riding the bus to the pr lot getting in their cars and stopping at cracker barrel on the way home
8853334 we are trying to encourage people to stay and spend their dollars in our town
8853335 it truly is a win win win for a lot of different people
8853336 there were people out at 8 a m until way after the game
8853337 wed like to have that for all seven home games this year
8853338 this way people can eat lunch before the game ride around to tar heel town and then head to the game
8853339 none of us can remember ever having charged this before
8853340 a bunny might come along and choke on it l n t leave no trace
8853341 but its a peanut dont they grow in the ground anyway
8853342 no lo dud cogi a mi hija y la meti en el coche le acompa una t a m a porque yo no sab a que hacer estaba nerviosa tem perder a mi ni a
8853343 nothing to do with the work here in orange county
8853344 we have to learn to use what we have available
8853345 i think the supplys here its just a question of getting the technology
8853346 i dont know having interacted with these delegates for a whole week if id even know who was for who
8853347 were here as one delegation and you dont hear any talk about clinton versus obama
8853348 now you will find that theyre 100 percent behind barack obama
8853349 we go through contested primaries all the time and we get over it and we realize that what unifies us is much more important than what divides us
8853350 theres no question that we are in the hunt this time
8853351 i think there is a common recognition among the north carolina delegates that we are important this year
8853352 i think asg was a little too concerned with its internal politics
8853353 ive tried to treat it like an honest to god budget
8853354 its almost too much money for that organization to handle
8853355 that 12 hour time difference is a real hurdle and it takes two weeks to really recover
8853356 definitely i went through an adjustment period a little jet lag and stuff
8853357 ive been playing hockey for the last eight months and when you have a week off it feels like you havent played in months
8853358 shes got a long international future in front of her
8853359 this is a good environment one thats safe for her but she can still give back to the program at the same time
8853360 thats one of the reasons i wanted to coach to see if i was any good at it
8853361 this weekend is not really about the opposition and who were playing
8853362 we scrambled in may because we were worried about the summer session
8853363 our administration and elected officials arent going to stand up for this so students have to lead this effort so that our friends our peers and people we dont even know in the future will have the same education that we had
8853364 we need students to take a stand choose a side
8853365 the conference is a great idea to see each other across the state
8853366 mcneese is a very explosive fast football team historically theyve always been that way
8853367 theyve had several successful football seasons obviously last year being 11 1 and typically their program is marked by having very very fast skilled players
8853368 theyre going to run a spread offense that when youre playing a spread offensive team you really need to be disciplined you have to it is assignment related football
8853369 we do see holes in their defense and were going to try to exploit them early
8853370 its a lot of eyes on us right now and thats why we have that mentality about the ant and the sledgehammer were just going to try and obliterate teams
8853371 we talk to our football team that you know how well you play to a high percentage is more about you
8853372 its how you prepare its how you play on saturday and you dont have any control over the opponent
8853373 i cant tell you whether theyve had good practices or bad practices i cant tell you whether theyre prepared to play all we can do is control our own fate
8853374 i mean the skys the limit we have the potential to do it
8853375 we just have to come out here and prove to everyone what we can do and show it
8853376 i think it gives us a better chance to win because you know how to get the other guys going and how to push his buttons how to get him hyped
8853377 if youre friends like that you care about that other person and you dont want to let them down
8853378 theres just no other person like him what he can do cant be matched
8853379 hes physically unmatched then when he steps on the field he feels like no one can block him and thats the way you have to play with that confident swagger
8853380 when i came here i didnt shoot to be just a good player on a decent team
8853381 i came here to try and go for the big dance im trying to play under the lights with the blimp in the sky
8853382 coach davis and the things that hes done win the super bowl coach with great coaches the teams that hes been around i think that he can take this program to another level where we can compete for a national championship every year
8853383 last year i was cramming like i was studying for an exam just trying to remember all the plays
8853384 weve been doing it so long now im a lot more relaxed a lot more confident
8853385 you can just see daylight to dawn how much more progress theyve made in the last six months because of the experience that they got to play last year
8853386 that was what i felt my weakest part was in retrospect i can improve every area of my game i always need work in every area but blocking was a big thing
8853387 if i added the 20 30 pounds i knew that just like that i wouldnt pick it up right away but it just helps me that much more keeping my ground against the bigger guy
8853388 and he exploded he got big he worked his butt off in the weight room every day eating right getting reps
8853389 last year it seemed like i was on the ground every play
8853390 after the defensive end made contact he would just throw me around where he wanted me to go
8853391 zack last year was kind of similar to a situational player
8853392 now that hes up to over 250 pounds were counting on zack to be a guy who can play in every single down and distance situation he went from 218 219 to 252 and didnt sacrifice any of his speed and quickness
8853393 it was harmless a lot of people are scared about being put on the spot
8853394 its just an amazing thing to have in carrboro its like a world class theater in our own backyard
8853395 i could just imagine that thats what shes like in real life you could tell she wasnt just doing a shtick
8853396 they focus on being a part of the community its very tight knit
8853397 it promotes getting people to go out and do something different
8853398 i felt like i played well against those two teams
8853399 i feel like that brought a light on me and now i feel like ive got to keep that light shining
8853400 bin ich ein m dchen f r alles mit rettungsschwimmer schein
8853401 jazz is a form of expression thats integral to the new orleans culture
8853402 you do your own thing but at the same time it all comes together
8853403 its three years after the fact and people just dont really care
8853404 if we had held this concert a few years ago right after it happened then this room would have been packed with people
8853405 if you go to places on the coast of mississippi you can see that its not even close to recovery
8853406 when we put our hand on the ground its going to be an earthquake theyre going to know were ready
8853407 we want blood we want food we hungry were going for that ball just know that when we put our hand down they better be scared theres some damage coming from it
8853408 oh s thats what better be going through their head
8853409 we wont really care which four are in the game at the same time
8853410 theyre all four good players and theyre all slightly different
8853411 i think the best thing it brings to the university community is an opportunity for a student to find a niche on campus and to use that niche to become more involved in the campus community
8853412 it helps protect neighborhoods from being overrun by very large groups of students
8853413 thats still about 20 percent more than the next highest district in the state
8853414 for the past 10 years weve concentrated on getting more students into the more rigorous courses available to them
8853415 these initiatives were meant to allow students of all backgrounds access to those higher level courses
8853416 its our policy that a students address should never determine their access to advanced courses
8853417 i think a lot has to do with our community were a college town and that means that students here get exposed to the college experience very early
8853418 ours is a community that sends more students to college than others our students understand the importance of the sat as a gateway to that
8853419 typically the higher the income of parents and the higher the education that they received the better those students do
8853420 notes are indeed a critical source of funding for emerging biotech companies
8853421 ive got loads and loads of work on and im finding the toddler quite demanding on my patience and need for personal space so im sorry if ive been a bit you know
8853422 the ltlp said that i was just fucking odd the other night im still really down about the unfairness of that
8853423 im sorry youve all got your own problems i know
8853424 anyway i think i need to make a couple of positive decisions
8853425 sort of sit down and work out whats important to me and what are you ignoring me
8853426 die kunst der entweihung der unn tzen provokation und des nonsens feiern
8853427 f r eine neue und alles andere als zwingende deutung der gesetzeslage
8853428 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8853429 when youve got money saturating politics and even if you care deeply about the public good youve got to see where the money is and thats what this is about every four years
8853430 now under the help america vote act the entire nation is floridated but the champ former florida secretary of state katherine harris aint got nothing on colorado
8853431 were sitting at purge ground zero the reason that theres a convention here is this is a swing state where democrats are piling in tens of thousands of new voters in colorado at the top of the bucket but at the bottom of the bucket the spread sheets are going poof
8853432 das ist ein historischer moment f r unser land da will ich einfach dabei sein
8853433 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8853434 hopes to receive a favourable opinion on the buyout from the tecmo board by september 4
8853435 i check gamesindustry biz every day you have to to know whats going on its definitely the best european news site and is beginning to offer a more global view too theres a ton of information and news on the net but this is the one that matters
8853436 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8853437 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8853438 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8853439 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8853440 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8853441 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8853444 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8853445 but this is a very solid market and will turn around
8853446 its got to give people pause and surely it will give opponents to casinos in massachusetts new arguments
8853447 casinos suck up all the available discretionary spending in a area and that means owners of restaurants and other small business need to be very concerned
8853448 people in new england like casinos and they have shown theyre willing to drive to them by going to connecticut all these years
8853449 i thought i could do something better i was trying to show off
8853450 these guys want to try a little more of everything
8853451 if you have a mobility impairment gravity is your enemy
8853452 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
8853453 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8853454 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that have shaped my life
8853455 and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8853456 i thought it was really important that he gave particulars of what we can expect
8853457 he was convincing at having an actual economic plan for financing the plans that he proposed so it was believable he could pull it off
8853458 he didnt just say what he was going to do but he laid out a plan for how he was going to do it
8853459 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8853460 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8853461 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8853462 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8853463 john mccain likes to say that hell follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8853464 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8853465 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8853466 dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8853467 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8853468 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8853469 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream the acceptance by senator barack obama of the presidential democratic nomination decided not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character
8853470 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8853471 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
8853472 i think he knows hes going to have to fight this one out
8853473 i think the change in tone is going to make a lot of democrats happy
8853474 i dont know what kind of life john mccain thinks celebrities live but this has been mine
8853475 i should have known since we take similar routes to work
8853476 we try to keep an eye out for each other when we find stuff but theres still this inherent sense of competition
8853477 will be on curb saturday august 23 after 12 00 noon first come first serve
8853478 someone came a while ago with a big van and took everything
8853479 but we prefer recycling it uses fewer materials there is so much stuff out there theres no need to make more if you dont need it
8853480 we cant keep a file cabinet in here because people jump on them for scrap metal
8853481 on thursdays they come in like locusts and take everything thats metal
8853482 our place became uninhabitable we had no place to live i had to live on peoples couches for three weeks
8853483 whom the gods wish to destroy they first call promising
8853484 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family

8853536 i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8853537 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8853538 he described a chance to keep the american promise and he made a lot of promises he is the pied piper of promises
8853539 a government that is powerful enough to give you everything you want can take everything you have
8853540 he is scarier than former president bill clinton because he is arrogant and a true believer
8853541 that is not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past

8853550 estamos aqu porque amamos demasiado a este pa s como para intentar que los pr ximos cuatro a os no sean como los ocho ltimos
8853551 es el momento de cambiar ee uu y por eso me presento al cargo de presidente
8853552 mccain no es presidente indicado para este pa s porque su labor ser una extensi n de la pol tica que bush ha desarrollado en la casa blanca durante los ltimos ocho a os
8853553 la pol tica exterior de bush y mccain ha despilfarrado el legado construido por generaciones de americanos dem cratas y republicanos y nosotros nos disponemos a recomponer ese legado
8853554 mccain no se mofa de la situaci n actual de ee uu m s bien parece que no entiende la realidad que nos ha tocado vivir
8853555 la creencia de que podemos lograr todo lo que nos propongamos es lo que ha caracterizado a este pa s pero ahora esta creencia est en peligro porque estamos en un momento de guerra nuestra econom a est agitada y el sue o americano est de nuevo bajo amenaza

8853571 as roma tahu mengenai tim liga primer karena sudah menghadapi manchester united selama dua musim terakhir jadi itu takkan jadi partai mudah bordeaux kubu prancis yang selalu bisa bagus di fase grup seperti lyon dan marseille jadi kami tak bisa meremehkan mereka
8853572 tentu saja tim rumania cluj tak bisa dikesampingkan walau saya tak tahu banyak tentang mereka tapi tim manapun yang bisa mencapai fase grup liga champions layak dihormati sehingga kami tak bisa meremehkan mereka kendati kami akan melakukan pekerjaan rumah tambahan menyelildiki tentang mereka

8853574 it is of course unfortunate in the circumstances that we had to change venue because we were all looking forward to a great icc awards night in pakistan
8853575 but dubai is a major player in the world of international cricket these days and it is good to be able to bring such a prestigious event to the home of the icc
8853576 in fact dubai is in many ways the perfect venue for the icc awards the city is centrally located for the global game and it is set to become a major cricketing hub in its own right the icc global cricket academy is set to open early next year as is the brand new 25 000 seater cricket stadium at dubai sports city

8853582 john mccain ha votado con george bush el 90 por ciento de las veces al senador mccain le gusta hablar de tener criterio pero realmente qu criterio tienes si piensas que george bush estuvo en lo cierto el 90 por ciento de las veces

8853591 in reference to what democrats must stand up and say on election day november 4th
8853592 they call it the ownership society but what it really means is that youre on your own
8853593 pull up your boot straps even if you dont have boots
8853594 the management and the administration at the hospital had been informed numerous times since 2005
8853595 they were warned there was a risk that the number of cases of c difficile would increase
8853596 we were not yet done being inspired by his leadership
8853597 why do we lose good men like shawn eades because only good men volunteer to serve their country
8853598 he was a soldier he loved his job but you and the girls were his life
8853599 he was someone who was respected and looked up to not only by his family but by his troops and those who served under him
8853600 the outpouring of love and respect since his passing stands as a far better tribute than anything i could say
8853601 he was a good man a loving father a cherished son a respected friend and he was my brother
8853602 its important for us to see what is out there
8853603 we want to make sure that our standards and practices are the leading edge practices and that we leave no stone unturned to make sure that the propane facilities are very safe to operate in ontario and that the public is safe
8853604 doesnt matter the age what matter is the love you feel
8853605 we need to boil that down we need to figure what changes have to be made to accommodate the concerns that are raised
8853606 theres been positive feedback but theres also been some adjustments that need to be made and we really need to sit down and talk about that and put our best foot forward
8853607 what are the adjustments that have to happen not to assume we got it all 100 per cent completely right
8853608 in my mind its a statement of principles its not a recipe
8853609 i think if we talk to people and tell them this is a statement of principles of intent and during the implementation that theres leeway to discuss with canadians i think thats the logical way to do it
8853610 one of the french language journalists who has left his mark on the coverage of canadian politics in the last 40 years
8853611 the chain of command has basically told us thats for the families and families alone and we are not doing any media exposure on this days as they go out the door
8853612 its normal activity for that region west of vancouver island is one of the most active earthquake areas in the world
8853613 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8853614 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
8853615 i think that it should be investigated at the nursing home but i think the plant in which all this has developed it certainly should be checked into very very thoroughly
8853616 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8853617 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
8853618 they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8853619 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
8853620 it is intended to be divided equally as the minister noted
8853621 we recognize that from one day to the next the absolute amount of time on a particular task may not be exactly equal
8853622 i dont think canadians were looking for an election but i think theyre ready to have one if thats what has to happen
8853623 i dont think theres going to be too much of a push back from canadians if in fact the writ is dropped
8853624 the data that were seeing suggests that if stephane dion and the liberals perform well in the campaign and soft ndp soft bloc quebecois and soft green voters are looking to change government that could favour the liberals
8853625 but thats an important if if stephane dion and the liberals perform well in the campaign its obviously a rule that holds true for the conservatives too
8853626 if thats the case how come so many people have died and we dont know how many more will be showing symptoms
8853627 the ball fell through and consumer confidence is right down the tubes with respect to government and companies like maple leaf its absolutely outrageous
8853628 i think that it should be investigated at the nursing home but i think the plant in which all this has developed it certainly should be checked into very very thoroughly
8853629 its affecting more and more people than you can possibly imagine
8853630 school lunches are going to have to be re thought hospitals cafeteria this is a major major consumer issue
8853631 they have to find out what caused this so that it can never happen again
8853632 if they dont find out how do i know that next month its not going to happen again or with some other products more care has to be put into how our food is prepared
8853633 the important message for people is that if you have the symptoms that are associated with listeriosis that you take precautionary actions as you see fit in terms of seeing a health professional or public health person
8853634 you know by a strange coincidence i was not elected miss congeniality in the united states senate this year
8853635 the good news is that we now have enough money to run the entire campaign in colorado the bad news is some of that money is still in your wallets and purses
8853636 in case you missed it a few days ago senator clinton tried to spend 1 million on the woodstock concert museum now ladies and gentlemen i wasnt there im sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event i was tied up at the time
8853637 remember the words of chairman mao its always darkest before its totally black

8853642 we spent 3 million to study the dna of bears in montana i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue
8853643 i spent several years in a north vietnamese prison camp in the dark fed with scraps do you think i want to do that all over again as vice president of the united states

8853647 the leader of the pad sondhi limthongkul has told me that the entire political system needs to be changed and says that perhaps thailand isnt ready for full democracy because of the endemic corruption
8853648 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8853649 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8853650 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8853651 is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive because next week in minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8853652 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 of the time
8853653 now i dont believe that sen mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8853654 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8853655 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11 and made clear that we must take out osama bin laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights
8853656 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8853657 a misleading speech that was fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8853658 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8853659 restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8853660 ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves
8853661 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
8853662 brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known
8853663 that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams
8853664 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8853665 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8853666 not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character this is one of our nations greatest defining moments
8853667 on this 45th anniversary of the march on washington and in honor of the legacies of my father and bobby kennedy let us elect a leader who has heard the clarion call
8853668 i would sit in the bathroom here and listen to him over the radio
8853669 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8853670 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8853671 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8853672 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8853673 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8853674 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8853675 those who made the judgment regarded themselves as educated people
8853676 in spite of that they tortured an innocent person and had her executed although it was known to them that the alleged crime was neither doable nor possible and that there was no legal basis for their verdict
8853677 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8853678 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8853679 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time

8853710 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8853711 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8853712 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8853713 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways

8853746 south ossetia is not a province it is not a country it is not a regime it is a business an enterprise run by chechist kgb generals and ossetian bandits for the sole purpose of grabbing the biggest possible chunk of money flowing from moscow to help destroy georgia
8853747 i cannot stomach the designation of south ossetia authorities as separatists
8853748 it could be vassily luniev south ossetias minister of defence who until recently was the military commissar of russias permsk region in siberia or perhaps anatolij barankiewicz former deputy military commissar of the stavropolski region of russia and the name jurij morozov premier of south ossetia doesnt sound very ossetian either

8853758 the number of achievements she has recorded in her life is impressive

8853812 there are a bunch of styles some of them are really low cut one of them is a thong some can hold two dildos

8853814 oh we recommend that you try them on right here over your clothes
8853815 no its okay really everyone does it this is good vibes weve seen it all believe me
8853816 i meant just for balance so you dont fall again
8853817 really i dont suppose youd like to have a glass of wine with my girlfriend and me
8853818 this is bad enough as it is im a dyke definitely not interested
8853819 if i loved both of you i wouldnt be one
8853820 psst skip the jelly ones and go for something firmer
8853821 it has a bendable core that lets you get just the right angle and it cleans up with warm water and soap
8853822 but if you use it for butt play or multiple partners we recommend boiling it
8853823 no that wont work at all dont you have a bigger bag

8853827 oh goody its a gift in a plain brown wrapper
8853828 its a tricky thing the tabloids know that a lot of people read them and they gauge whos hot and whos not by who is on the cover if thats what being hot right now is i dont want to be that

8853830 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8853831 we havent got a bottle to work on lets not underestimate how difficult it will be for us to get to the bottom of this
8853832 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8853833 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8853834 im humbly anticipating a game this week and thats it
8853835 i dont really know what to expect im very much looking forward to the game im ready
8853836 its a big game for us we need a win and im confident we can get one
8853837 hes been around a long time and knows what to expect
8853838 mark has done everything asked of him at training and deserves this chance
8853839 we saw dino zoff win a world cup at 40 mark needs time to get back into the rhythm and routine of football but hes still got it
8853840 i think once hes back in top condition and form theres no reason why he couldnt be regarded as one of the best in the league
8853841 queensland roar is a registered trademark its registered with the ffa also with the trademarks division so we certainly intend to keep the name queensland
8853842 weve spent four years marketing queensland and we certainly dont see any need to change that
8853843 the first two new teams coming from queensland shows that football is alive and well in this state
8853844 were producing good players and to have two new teams for the derbies its going to be fantastic

8853847 in case of an account loss its not only people working on that account who are impacted but also the support staff
8853848 the sooner it gets out of the way the sooner it becomes less of a distraction for our side and for the wider football community
8853849 but when it happens were not too concerned with it and i would expect given his average of shots on goal that somewhere in the first half or somewhere in the third quarter he would get an opportunity to kick his couple of goals that he needs
8853850 if he only kicks one but if our team kicks 15 or 20 goals and we win the game then were not too fussed about that
8853851 brads last three weeks have been ok but probably some of his ruck work has dropped off a bit

8853880 i think people have become complacent and they have not understood what would happen if an economy starts to slow fast if firms start to close what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming and people with little experience of what is really going on

8853883 what is needed from the devolved administration at stormont is a set of policies to take account of the different population profiles in the catholic and protestant communities to answer their different needs and stop following the outdated nio mindset of trying to pretend that everything here would be ok if everyone started behaving as if they lived in england
8853884 in january five north belfast protestant clergy wrote to the unionist oriented news letter complaining of the failure of the executive to tackle sectarianism they wrote we have poor inter community relationships effective apartheid in housing across our villages towns and cities community division exemplified in but not confined to the physical structures of peace walls slow pace of reconciliation sectarianism and fractured educational provision our real angst is that a suggested programme for government almost totally fails to acknowledge these profoundly difficult issues exist the response from the dup junior minister in ofmdfm mr donaldson was that power sharing was the shared interpretation which seemed to confuse politics as means with the ends it aimed to realise the draft programme for government had significantly replaced the language of a shared future with a better future inline with its prioritisation of the economy a much more convivial focus for members of the political class than the challenge of tackling the communal divisions in which they were so deeply implicated the revised pfg32 published by messrs paisley and mcguinness introduced the clumsy circumlocution of a shared and better future
8853885 is a matter the government has to consider in due course but we are not at that point in our discussions at all yet the point of discussion we are at at the moment is examining the outcome of the referendum and obviously there will be a lot meetings with eu colleagues between now and the end of the year where it will be discussed further with them so its not just a matter for our own personal consideration or national consideration it is a matter we have to discuss with colleagues as well
8853886 in every society there is a substantial gap between the life expectancy of the children of the most affluent and privileged and those who are born into deprivation but some countries are better than others at closing the gap
8853887 a boy in the suburb of calton glasgow can expect to live 28 years less than one raised in lenzie a few miles away one born in hampstead london will live around 11 years longer than a boy from st pancras five stops away on the northern line of the underground
8853888 even in these times when all the talk is of putting history behind us the easiest way to tell the difference between the irish and the english is to utter the word
8853889 i was myself assaulted and received death threats the depth of hatred that still exists in ireland is matched only by unawareness in non catholic english circles of what cromwell did in ireland i am reminded of gk chestertons remark that the tragedy of the english conquest of ireland in the 17th century is that the irish can never forget it and the english can never remember it
8853890 it was in accordance with the laws of war but it went far beyond what any general had done in england
8853891 this was ethnic cleansing on a scale undreamt of by slobodan milosevic
8853892 reverence for cromwell was one of the few socialist traditions that survived the transition from old to new labour
8853893 he was on the right side in the civil war and because of him the right side won he changed the course of english history and changed it for the better
8853894 until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved
8853895 it is increasingly a manifestation of republican frustration at the failure of sinn f in to deliver what it promised to its own movement
8853896 nationalists and republicans will once again be disappointed by the attitude being displayed by the sdlp
8853897 any commitments that were given by the government to sinn f in are a matter for the government but the dup made the situation perfectly clear before we left st andrews that we had not agreed to any dates for the transfer of powers
8853898 i say again that until the executive shows that it can deal with the matters already devolved it should not be taking on more especially a portfolio as contentious as justice
8853899 i was outside the family home when the raid began and i was inside immediately afterwards speaking with the family who are close friends of mine the reality of the ruc psni was here for all to see in broad daylight and the residents of this estate remain justifiably suspicious of the force
8853900 most accounts agree that it was south ossetian separatists who committed the first act of escalation when they blew up a georgian military vehicle on august 1 wounding five georgian peacekeeping troops georgia responded in kind killing six south ossetian militiamen
8853901 capt ivanov and eduard kokoity the pro moscow president of south ossetia say they held a meeting that day between marat kulakhmetov commander of the russian peacekeeping forces and temur yakobashvili the georgian minister for re integration whose job is to deal with the breakaway regions
8853902 i would like to address those who are now shooting at georgian policemen i want to say with full responsibility that several hours ago i reached a very difficult decision not to respond with fire this was no use however and the fighting escalated
8853903 georgian president sakashvilis biggest lie was his attempt to airbrush the fact that he created the crisis by launching an artillery barrage on the south ossetian capital which killed scores of civilians and 15 russian peacekeepers it was absurd to think russia would not retaliate so the next lie was to claim russias leaders had prepared a trap in fact they were taken by surprise as much as the ossetians nevertheless russia should pull back completely now it should also have restrained south ossetian militias from running amok against georgian villages
8853904 eyesight of thousands to be saved after nice approves drug
8853905 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8853906 clintons deputy national policy director jake sullivan outlined several irish policies that would be undertaken in a clinton white house come 2009 he said clinton would immediately appoint an american special envoy on ireland who would maintain an office in the white house and report directly to the president clinton would also firmly focus on economic development in northern ireland sullivan said and have her secretary of commerce and other government agencies get involved in developing strategies for ireland
8853907 in the observer alan ruddock begins his account with the morning of september 11 the day of the terrorist attack on the world trade centre in new york as the us special envoy to ireland richard haas was preparing for a meeting with sinn fein leader gerry adams
8853908 after a few minutes of talking about inching forward towards the peace process haas finally snapped
8853909 yet there were indications that no 10 had more room for manoeuvre than it realised in july 2005 the ira had finally agreed to decommission all its weapons at the last minute adams called no 10 to demand that some of the weapons not be destroyed so that the ira could arm itself against possible attacks from dissident members unless this was allowed he threatened decommissioning would not proceed the blair government conceded but wanted to check with dublin irish justice minister michael mcdowell refused to acquiesce in the backsliding despite enormous pressure powell told adams of the problem and adams gave way decommissioning took place as planned
8853910 anyone who omits one step in that sequence of values is falsifying the situation
8853911 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8853912 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8853913 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031
8853914 the cardinal has not made clear why religion should get a free pass
8853915 at least one blast bomb as well as bottles stones and petrol bombs have been thrown at police investigating a security alert in the tullygally and drumbeg areas of craigavon
8853916 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8853917 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8853918 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8853919 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence

8853962 the work is assembled from our collection of naturally mummified animal parts tiny little creatures teased and tortured by our feral farmyard cat that when assembled will cast a shadow of our profiles onto the walls of the ancient egyptian galleries
8853963 the series and this project are united in their ambition in both cases across both media the desire is to highlight sculptures unceasing potency statuephilia will bring together a group of modern sculptors all of whom have prowled through the corridors and display cabinets of the british museum in their formative years looking at sculpture and feeling its unmatched international potency the british museum helped to make these artists what they are now they are seeking to return the favour
8853964 perhaps because the british museum is often celebrated as a museum of antiquities it is not always realised that its collections also include a broad range of contemporary works from around the world ever since its foundation in 1753 the museum has acquired modern material alongside objects from ancient times and this exhibition is a demonstration of the power of this duality
8853965 the british museum is a laboratory of possibility for any creative mind it is filled with objects that reach across time and touch us intimately seeing as a child the great head of rameses and the assyrian winged bulls at the bm was what made me become a sculptor
8853966 we are delighted to sponsor this unique exhibition to mark the broadcast of the sculpture diaries series our ongoing partnership with the british museum is a great inspiration to our work

8853986 angesichts des bis zum ende des jahres erwarteten beitrages aus ver u erungserl sen aus der vivico sind wir zuversichtlich dass das ergebnis des zweiten halbjahres 2008 deutlich ber dem des ersten halbjahres ausfallen wird wir sind als investor mit einer dezidiert langfristigen perspektive vom nachhaltigen inneren wert der ca immo berzeugt und bringen dies nicht zuletzt durch den im juli 2008 begonnenen aktienr ckkauf zum ausdruck vor diesem hintergrund halten wir somit an unserem ziel der n chsten hauptversammlung erstmals eine dividende vorzuschlagen fest
8853987 das in den ersten drei quartalen erwirtschaftete ergebnis ist sehr gut auch f r das vierte quartal sind wir positiv gestimmt und best tigen unsere prognose
8853988 die schaffung der wirtschafts und w hrungsunion wwu war die richtige antwort europas auf die herausforderungen der globalisierung und die teilnahme sterreichs von beginn an war die logische fortsetzung einer in den jahrzehnten davor betriebenen w hrungspolitischen stabilit ts und integrationspolitik
8853989 es waren ereignisreiche arbeitsreiche und erfolgreiche jahre jahre die von einer f lle von ver nderungen gepr gt waren wie sie wohl einmalig im leben eines menschen sind
8853990 qualit t geht vor geschwindigkeit das hei t die erf llung der konvergenzkriterien ist unabdingbar
8853991 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8853992 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as
8853993 i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8853994 the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8853995 never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8853996 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8853997 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8853998 im just so proud were standing here cheering for a black man
8853999 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
8854000 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
8854001 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
8854002 those are well known we thought we had overcome them apparently there are still some lingering frustrations but there is no territorial ambition or desire to dismember iraq
8854003 what really stands out when youve got vlad and teixeira back to back in the same lineup is what he isnt
8854004 lets put it this way i know which one i fear and it isnt him to me when you see truly great players they always have that extra edge that killer instinct well if this guy has it he doesnt project it
8854005 seriously two people got paid to pass this information along how come they have jobs in sports arrrgh
8854006 yeah teixeira sure isnt projecting definitely not hitting consistently and with uh power
8854007 must be a reason this guy wanted to remain anonymous zing
8854008 die bilanz zum dritten gesch ftsquartal ist besser als prognostiziert ausgefallen und k nnte eine erh hung der analystensch tzungen nach sich ziehen
8854009 diese aussagen sind nat rlich nicht positiv f r merck und k nnten heute im tasgesverlauf zu einer unterdurchschnittlichen kursentwicklung f hren auch wenn die aussagen zum wachstum mercks erwartungen entsprechen
8854010 es ist keine wirkliche berraschung und die aktien haben gestern schon fast zehn prozent zugelegt
8854011 im going to f ck you like a dog f ck me in the a se etc so last night i had sex with this girl ive been dating but she kept laughing and giggling is this normal en espa ol
8854012 dass wir uns auch beim gas nicht noch st rker einseitig abh ngig machen d rfen
8854013 for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons the shortage of secure supplies of energy food and water the challenge of climate change and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
8854014 in recent days weve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with russias challenge to the free and democratic country of georgia barack obama and i will end this neglect we will hold russia accountable for its actions and well help the people of georgia rebuild
8854015 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8854016 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8854017 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors

8854028 jeg ved ikke hvilket liv john mccain tror at celebriteter f rer men dette er mit liv disse mennesker er mine helte deres historier er det som har formet mig
8854029 hvis du ikke har nogen friske ideer s er du n dt til at bruge teknikker til at skr mme v lgerne
8854030 john mccain st r alene med sin st dige afvisning af til at afslutte en forkert krig
8854031 john mccain siger han vil f lge bin laden til helvedes porte men han vil ikke engang f lge ham til den hule hvor han bor det er ikke den form for d mmekraft vi har brug for det vil ikke holde amerika sikkert vi har brug for en pr sident som kan st op imod fremtidens trusler ikke een som bliver ved med at h ge sig fast i fortidens ideer
8854032 how can mccain walk out on a stage with any confidence after this
8854033 in football soccer its the other way round if our english qualified figure starts to fall then that will begin to affect the national team there can be no question that is starting to happen in soccer

8854035 i genuinely could not walk down a flight of stairs after games i was playing on one leg there was absolutely no way i could step off my left leg
8854036 i was honestly surprised i was getting selected for australia i think i was getting selected on reputation not form
8854037 i think players need to take far more ownership of their injuries and the management of them i should have been resting my knee but i made myself available during the 2005 tri nations
8854038 at that time stirlo stirling mortlock got injured chris latham got injured and elton flatley suffered his head knock so they told me they needed me i knew my body wasnt right but i knew the team was struggling i thought i would just have a bench spot and play a few minutes but i was starting every game
8854039 when you look at it if you are physically in good shape then you should be improving each season but that hasnt happened with my career i never kicked on from my good debut season
8854040 i know that when i am in good shape and fit i play well and i keep improving every time i have not played well it has been because i have been carrying an injury
8854041 a la cl avec le rsa ce sera aussi des conomies ce seront des salaires qui seront vers s et donc de la richesse en plus pour tout le monde

8854044 als je goed met statistieken omgaat leidt dat absoluut tot betere business dat kan meer omzet zijn maar ook betere service of meer leads
8854045 het is nog lang niet bij iedereen doorgedrongen dat dat allemaal realtime kan
8854046 als je goed met de beschikbare informatie omgaat kun je aan de knoppen draaien en direct je business verbeteren maar daar moet je je organisatie dan wel goed op inrichten
8854047 het vraagt om een bijstelling van je bedrijfsprocessen grotere klanten hebben soms wel tot 250 websites hoe krijg je het dan als onderneming geregeld dat je voor al die sites steeds de juiste informatie boven water krijgt en er dan ook nog wat mee doet dat is een enorme uitdaging ik denk dat deze problematiek ondanks de enorme groei van het online kanaal in de meeste boardrooms nog niet eens is doorgedrongen
8854048 hoe je als organisatie nu met alle beschikbare informatie omgaat is heel erg afhankelijk van je mensen zijn die bereid of in staat om op een nieuwe lees snellere manier te werken het nieuwe werken vereist mensen die comfortabel zijn in een omgeving waar ze snel moeten schakelen de jongere generatie heeft dit wel in zich maar het probleem is dat zij vaak weer minder andere bagage hebben en nog niet ervaren genoeg zijn voor complexe bedrijfsvraagstukken dat is het probleem waar alle organisaties nu mee kampen onze consultancytak loopt dan ook als een trein er zijn gewoon niet genoeg mensen die hierbij kunnen assisteren
8854049 informatie moet realtime zijn en makkelijk toegankelijk het is juist niet de bedoeling dat je allerlei cursussen moet volgen voordat je kunt segmenteren ook de hr manager moet ermee kunnen spelen
8854050 were going to have everything 100 percent under my control
8854051 if i stayed in the race id have to give equal time every time i talked on the air
8854052 i knew i could not stay in that crazy environment anymore
8854053 i took a leap of faith that something would happen
8854054 its something weve never seen before and hope to never see again
8854055 i think its maybe the economy right now lots of people cant find jobs
8854056 im really surprised with the economy with the way it is that there hasnt been more robberies
8854057 i hear every day another area another store has been robbed im anxious to address that issue particularly
8854058 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence
8854059 to the contrary at this meeting the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut
8854060 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8854061 im acting based on what my obligations are under that law and based upon what city council has asked me to do
8854062 you enjoy nature and the people and places that you see
8854063 you drive your car up north you dont take all the back roads its just a slower pace and you look around and see all the open fields
8854064 were aware of all the constraints around that week but we havent got a preferred outcome because we dont know what the results of the games beforehand are going to be
8854065 with all the finals venues and the potential clashes we tend not to worry too much about them because you finish up worrying about things that dont happen
8854066 potentially for a grand final qualifier clearly telstra dome would be our preference
8854067 if we want to play it at telstra dome its only available saturday thats a pretty clear choice if we want to play it at telstra dome
8854068 i think there will be a lot of people interested to come straight from an afl grand final straight to a major rugby league final
8854069 thats up to us to increase our awareness and do all we can to make people aware of the importance of the game
8854070 thats the way channel nine and the nrl hold the games and we think it will be an interesting exercise
8854071 well play any time anywhere provided its played here in melbourne
8854072 were confident that it will sell well and we can get as much of melbourne as we can behind us
8854073 last friday april 16th 1943 i was forced to interrupt my work in the laboratory in the middle of the afternoon being affected with a remarkable restlessness combined with a slight dizziness
8854074 ok guys now step slowly away from the stage before it gets cheesy oops too late
8854075 ci teniamo a fare bene nella prima partita di campionato ha detto colantuono
8854076 come tutte le squadre ancora non abbiamo raggiunto il top della condizione che arriver dopo la quarta quinta giornata la nostra una squadra che ha voglia motivata concentrata e che ama non perdere da domani si riparte si chiuso un ciclo con giocatori importanti e speriamo di aprirne uno nuovo con giocatori altrettanto importanti
8854077 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8854078 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8854079 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8854080 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8854081 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8854082 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8854083 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8854084 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8854085 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8854086 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8854087 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8854088 south africas wildlife overwhelmed me i did a bit of research before my arrival in johannesburg hoping that i would not be totally unprepared for the nine day birding trip but no amount of research could have prepared me for the experience

8854096 dont be fooled glaxosmithklines scare tactics are only concerned with protecting its profit not the health of people with hiv aids
8854097 basically in very short and lay terms an ad cannot be false cannot be misleading and must have what is called fair balance
8854098 ask your doctor if there are hiv medications with a low risk of diarrhea
8854099 theyre more or less fighting for market share at this point
8854100 one of the classic examples of that would be the pepsi challenge
8854101 from my perspective this is the way that gsk has always kind of handled things in the past
8854102 their modus operandi is always kind of to bash the competition and they do that in a number of ways
8854103 running jaws ads is just going to raise the anxiety level very high for people nervous about getting treatment this could put them over the edge
8854104 this all started because we asked our customers what they liked about our stores and what they didnt like
8854105 more cosmetic changes like changing signs and names are creative but dont address that more fundamental problem of competitive pricing
8854106 it is just not like the state stores when i grew up they are very well run well prepared
8854107 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8854108 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8854109 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8854110 this all started because we asked our customers what they liked about our stores and what they didnt like
8854111 more cosmetic changes like changing signs and names are creative but dont address that more fundamental problem of competitive pricing
8854112 it is just not like the state stores when i grew up they are very well run well prepared
8854113 two companies to follow the same principles to a different outcome
8854114 it makes sense to have a single standard but the transition is going to be difficult
8854115 its an immense project this will be like a full employment act for the accounting industry
8854116 simon property group put in roads sewer and water now we own the doughnut around them and our site is fully prepared to develop
8854117 well probably spend 150 million by the time were finished
8854118 the real 64 000 question here is how many units is it going to generate
8854119 we think its going to be a substantial number of new basic customers
8854120 this is the time to hold onto your free television experience because what is happening with digital television is revolutionary
8854121 you cant expect the redemption rate to be 100 percent
8854122 we are working to make sure we dont exclude anybody
8854123 well probably get a few new customers but we are not banking on a big windfall
8854124 you dont need mass appeal or millions of customers to be a success but your definition of success needs to be a keystone of your brand you decide what success is then show the world how magnificently successful you are by that light youve got to create the fame and fortune in your own outlook first claim your position
8854125 the behavior of one demographic remained absolutely consistent every single time a child walked past he or she tried to stop and watch and every single time a parent scooted the kid away
8854126 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
8854127 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8854128 men are so scared and ashamed of the feelings they have sometimes
8854129 the worst thing a man can admit is im not 100 percent fulfilled by my family
8854130 twelve years ago i would have been hard pressed to understand why id want to be involved sexually with one person this long
8854131 before t a the longest my intense sexual interest would last would be maybe two years but the thing men dont realize is that initial rush you get from sex gives way to something else a lot of guys run with fear when that intensity starts to fade but the real rewards of a relationship come after youve been together a while thats where t a and i are lucky it keeps getting deeper its kind of exciting im as surprised as anybody
8854132 im not running for president so i dont have to answer that question but theres nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of lifes rich experience
8854133 and if my wife were sitting here shed say the same thing the only thing that matters is your word and whether you live up to it or not you cant control your mind why would you want to you cant feel guilty about being alive about being a man about feeling attracted you can only control your actions
8854134 how do i get breast milk out of my black dress
8854135 christina went through hell and back growing up for years she struggled with her self esteem so she knows how hard it is for young girls
8854136 to learn how she can help them get better without having to go through all the pain she did as a child
8854137 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8854138 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8854139 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8854140 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8854141 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8854142 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8854143 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8854144 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8854145 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8854146 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8854147 john daly has produced some truly iconic films proving that he is one the greats of his generation and we feel very proud to be honouring one of our own countrymen
8854148 he has inspired generations of film makers and actors and as a university with a long standing reputation for excellence in media we believe its very fitting to honour him at this time
8854149 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8854150 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8854151 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8854152 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8854153 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8854154 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8854155 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8854156 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8854157 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8854158 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8854159 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8854160 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8854161 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8854162 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8854163 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8854164 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8854165 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8854166 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8854167 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8854168 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8854169 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8854170 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8854171 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8854172 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8854173 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8854174 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8854175 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8854176 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8854177 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8854178 porque lloro bueno no importa el porque pero si sigo aqui llorare mas
8854179 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
8854180 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani
8854181 la scuola ha detto deve rimettere al centro la persona e preparare i ragazzi ad essere cittadini consapevoli dei diritti e dei doveri e conoscitori dei principi costituzionali
8854182 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
8854183 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti
8854184 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8854185 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8854186 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8854187 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8854188 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8854189 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8854190 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8854191 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8854192 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8854193 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8854194 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8854195 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8854196 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8854197 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8854198 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8854199 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8854200 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8854201 who are open to doing something on the production side
8854202 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8854203 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8854204 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8854205 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8854206 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8854207 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8854208 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
8854209 vi chiedo di farlo con gli occhi fissi al futuro nello spirito dellunit e con lo scopo della vittoria
8854210 obama dovr ricostruire il sogno americano e restituire allamerica il suo prestigio nel mondo
8854211 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8854212 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8854213 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8854214 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8854215 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica
8854216 hillary marted ha conquistato tutti e con bill avete visto cosa accade quando un presidente mette la gente al primo posto ci riprenderemo lamerica perch sono le persone normali a fare cose straordinarie

8854218 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8854219 grazie al loro impegno alla dedizione dei giovani ed alla certezza delle posizioni tenute dal partito
8854220 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit
8854221 la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori
8854222 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
8854223 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

8854226 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
8854227 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8854228 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
8854229 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre

8854232 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
8854233 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8854234 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8854235 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8854236 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8854237 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8854238 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
8854239 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
8854240 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
8854241 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema
8854242 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani
8854243 con profonda gratitudine e grande umilt accetto la nomination per la presidenza degli stati uniti
8854244 a john mccain sta a cuore lamerica il problema che non capisce
8854245 che ciascuno di noi libero di vivere come vuole ma che abbiamo anche lobbligo di trattaci lun laltro con dignit e rispetto
8854246 in quando commander in chief non esiter mai a difendere questa nazione ma invier le truppe solo con una missione chiara e il sacro impegno a fornir loro quanto necessario durante la battaglia e le cure e i benefici che meritano una volta tornati a casa

8854249 if i look at the situation in the second quarter we would have to say it was more self inflicted
8854250 whenever youre restarting growth what i can tell you is its an imprecise process there were some parts of the business where we were probably too aggressive
8854251 when you look at their arsenal price is really their only weapon
8854252 they play their music loud though so they want a condo thats soundproof
8854253 on the basis of the physical damage to the aircrafts forward cargo hold and cabin it is evident that the number four passenger oxygen cylinder sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurised contents
8854254 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8854255 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8854256 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8854257 i thought it was marvelous he laid out what he is going to do its not going to be easy but he is going to try
8854258 individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise
8854259 he did a great job addressing the areas where he has been attacked patriotism his qualifications for the job and how he plans to pay for all his ideas
8854260 the over the top stadium show surrounding the speech might help motivate his supporters but it might be playing into the hands of his critics who try to paint him as a rock star with no substance
8854261 he described a chance to keep the american promise and he made a lot of promises he is the pied piper of promises
8854262 a government that is powerful enough to give you everything you want can take everything you have
8854263 he is scarier than former president bill clinton because he is arrogant and a true believer
8854264 it was a feel good speech it made you think about yourself and where you wanted the united states to go it was just him making you feel good for the purpose of him getting elected
8854265 o problema que se voc acha esse tipo de coisa na europa uma cidade se voc acha isso em outro lugar tem de ser outra coisa
8854266 elas t m planejamento e organiza o incr veis mais do que muitos exemplos cl ssicos do que as pessoas chamam de urbanismo

8854269 a historic day for hp and eds and the clients we serve
8854270 the largest in the outsourcing sectors history and the second largest in the it industry overall
8854271 its second only to hps 19 billion buyout of computer maker compaq in 2002
8854272 for sa there is still work to do before we are able to finally close
8854273 my expectation is that in the next two to three weeks we will have a much clearer view on what the next steps will be for us locally
8854274 i think staying for too long at the head of an organisation might not be a good idea
8854275 a major national crisis with potentially perilous implications that will go beyond our national economy if not properly resolved
8854276 the response to this national crisis must begin from a clear understanding that the situation which now exists in the niger delta region cannot be resolved through force of arms
8854277 niger delta a major national crisis and admirable vision and objectives of delta state governments economic strategy
8854278 the country must recognise that we now have in the niger delta region a major national crisis with potentially perilous implications that will go beyond our national economy if not properly resolved
8854279 with this partnership we greatly extend the consumer value of our oem technology platforms evo1 and evo2 under this agreement our oem customers can now chose to integrate premium video demand services from one of the international leaders in the vod content business when they use our platform for their own connected tv or set top box products
8854280 establishing winbox as our first partner in europe is a great step forward in our strategy towards expanding our services to consumers and retailers outside the u s
8854281 with winboxs innovative solutions we can extend the premium online experience to the tv further delivering on the cinemanow mission to empower consumers to enjoy digital entertainment anytime and anywhere
8854282 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8854283 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8854284 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8854285 i felt that no one could see beyond the fact that i had a two year old son and therefore they had no expectations of me i was determined to prove them wrong everyone else was going to uni so why shouldnt i
8854286 i am lucky because i get the chance to have two lives one as a mature and responsible mum and the other as a young woman at university who enjoys student life the university have been really supportive especially when i decided to change my course at the end of the first year
8854287 university has taught me so much not just about studying but about motivation self discipline and also other people one of the best things has been meeting and studying with students from other countries and learning about their lives and cultures which has been an education in itself
8854288 du bliver der indtil du f r lov at g

8854290 sugerir que os estados unidos orquestraram isso em benef cio de um candidato presidencial n o soa racional
8854291 a suspeita de que algu m nos estados unidos criou esse conflito especialmente com o prop sito de tornar a situa o mais tensa e criar uma vantagem competitiva para um dos candidatos brigando pelo posto de presidente dos estados unidos
8854292 o fato que cidad os americanos realmente estavam na rea durante o conflito na oss tia do sul

8854297 whenever a downturn appears the next 3 4 quarters will be difficult for panel makers in running their business whether this will occur again between 2h08 and 1h09 rest on two main factors 1 can the production output cutbacks ease the current supply and demand imbalance 2 when panel prices reach near the cash cost level panel makers will have little willingness to continue producing panels whether this will stabilize panel prices remains to be seen but one thing for certain is that the current macroeconomic woes are causing panel makers to face bigger pressures in sustaining their profits

8854347 this is my first varsity game as a head coach
8854348 and second of all we will like to go down as not losing but having a winning season
8854349 we will be the first team to ever play varsity football
8854350 thirty years from now we can look back and say yeah we did ok
8854351 you win a game by using the sound fundamentals that we do or by doing our best
8854352 when you watch someone play it makes you want to get in
8854353 this book was easy to read and is highly recommended as reading for undergraduate students i would also recommend this book as a quick reference for clinicians this book gives the reader an excellent basic understanding of dental trauma
8854354 so many games are won in the fourth quarter or lost in the fourth quarter so as much as you can you want to keep those guys fresh for the fourth quarter when we go into the fourth quarter i want our best soldiers on the field and you want to press if a guy plays 65 70 plays you go into the fourth quarter and he doesnt have much gas left
8854355 the game has changed a lot in the 13 years ive been in the league
8854356 before defensive linemen had to do everything now you have guys to rush the passer guys playing against the run they used to have to do both you have to study more because youre probably going against more than one guy
8854357 if you get your opportunity and take advantage of it you can play a while because there are a lot of tricks you can learn as you get older
8854358 its because you dont really have to do much more than block people
8854359 a lot of those other guys even if theyre backups are playing on special teams and putting themselves in position where they can get hurt that has a lot to do with it youre asked to do less youre specializing there arent a lot of other things youre doing
8854360 thats when you can get rolled up from behind thats how you get hurt
8854361 i think a lot of the defensive injuries come from friendly fire you know theyre hitting each other during tackles on top of piles and stuff thats how a lot of them get hurt gang tackling but on the offensive line you can control what you hit and how youre getting hit one of the main things we have to protect is our knees getting rolled up on the line of scrimmage
8854362 they know what spot they have to get to so we have to kind of read off their motions thats pretty much the only advantage they have theyre trying to get their hands on us and we have to prevent them from doing that and get our hands on them first you have to learn how to read certain keys so when you see an offensive lineman move a certain way you know how to react thats the biggest thing for us
8854363 theyve probably helped the offensive linemen because they can hold more
8854364 they dont call holding quite as much they let you grab up in here the chest a little bit i dont think they ever put in rules that help the defense theres a rule that you cant touch a receiver after 5 yards everythings changed a little bit to favor the offense
8854365 you have to hold off guys who are 300 some pounds and at the same time try to get to the ball and make reads see where things are at
8854366 i really think everybody has a mutual respect for each other out there
8854367 i think theres actually more skill involved because its very technical
8854368 the players in what are called skill positions are in more of an athletic position theres more skill involved in what we do
8854369 last time team officials called me up and said were going out to oakland for a week
8854370 so i pack up some clothes and get out to oakland and look on tv and everything i own is under water
8854371 weve all had time to put together a clear plan as to how it affects the organization the team the families of the team
8854372 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8854373 we have wide splits we may consider a version of it for next year
8854374 i dont know enough about it but im going to look into it
8854375 i read about it in a magazine article we might revisit it as a mix up play
8854376 playing good football i would even take it to the first couple of weeks in camp where he struggled with a couple of things worked through that and came out in a positive way
8854377 kevin is ready to play and a j has already proven he can play thats a real positive thing right now i have no problem putting kevin in a game right now hell do a good job
8854378 although its just the preseason and the starters werent there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8854379 the biggest thing now is to not regress ive gotten progressively better i just cant regress when im sitting on the sidelines i have to make sure i get plenty of reps in practice and keep my part
8854380 the group we have out there right now i really like
8854381 i dont know if its the twos or what it is but it seemed like everyone we had in there had great continuity everyone works hard and thats all you can ask of those guys
8854382 there are a couple of things there that we are working on and i think weve got that nailed down
8854383 i think he has a chance to be a pretty good quarterback so well see how he keeps progressing
8854384 hes been through a full year and going into your second year most players are a little bit more comfortable with the system he can anticipate the upcoming events a little bit better
8854385 absolutely spent was i thinking about leaving him in i definitely had a thought about it but i knew there definitely was no sense in sending him back out
8854386 this is our time to hold these leads this is our job were not getting it done right now
8854387 it would be kind of interesting wouldnt it to play for the nlcs title right here
8854388 anyone who has played in the last six ryder cups has experienced getting their butt beat so i mean im not looking for experience im going to pick players that are playing well and that are very confident
8854389 i really want to play on the team but thinking about it would get in my way
8854390 if i just focus on what gets me to play well it will help me get on the team and if i do get on the team it will help me play well in the ryder cup
8854391 for one thing he is definitely faster than derrick was
8854392 i think he is going to be even better than derrick was last year
8854393 we are trying to defend the title to the best of our ability
8854394 i asked them if i dont get a call then what should i do
8854395 it doesnt matter im just going out there and if i can show the eagles something thats good if not hopefully one of those 31 other teams are looking sure i want to be a part of this nobody wants to start over but if i have to go i still want to make a living i have a family to take care of
8854396 ill take my butt back to college and finish up my last semester then try again next year i have a semester left for a communications degree
8854397 you never know exactly whats going on or what theyre thinking
8854398 ive been there myself all you can do is control what you control play hard and let it fall where it may
8854399 it was a bad time you have anger disappointment and uncertainty about whats going to happen
8854400 the hardest part is accepting it and the uncertainty of what youre going to do next
8854401 its really not about cutting its about waiting for that next call
8854402 im trying to get back everything i did last year
8854403 i think we have a shot at being in the mix at the end well have a chance
8854404 if we lose a dorian bell or another impact player thats going to be tough to overcome
8854405 i didnt know i had a day off until i saw the situation taking place
8854406 in my mind i thought i was going to face somebody in the eighth but i just work here they know what theyre doing hopefully in september well have extra bullets in our arms
8854407 sometimes they are smarter than we are we just go with our energy and adrenaline im never going to second guess my manager hes the boss if he feels i need a day off so be it but as athletes we like to be out there every day but we still have a few days before september im pretty sure once september arrives you might not see that happen
8854408 hopefully ill be able to finish up strong for them
8854409 i dont know i looked in the stands the whole time
8854410 dubee already told me are you ready to lead the pitchers meeting im not a whole lot of help a couple of the hitters asked how this guy is going to pitch them how is this pitcher going to try to strike me out try to get you to swing and miss three times chase thats what i told chase last night
8854411 but our focus is still to outwork other teams and win the league championship
8854412 were going to have to keep them as fresh as possible
8854413 im going to have to be conscious about getting them on and off the field
8854414 i think its fair the only problem is it is really kind of tough for some of these other schools
8854415 edison has a lot of kids so they are a big school
8854416 he is probably one of the best defensive backs that i know of
8854417 he is one of my best athletes and most intelligent athletes
8854418 we kind of thought that adding the catholic league was the one last missing piece that we wanted
8854419 we stayed away from our championships being considered a true state championship because the whole state wasnt represented
8854420 we are now at the point that we can say it is a true state championship
8854421 i think this is a great opportunity for us to show what we are all about
8854422 and maybe we can put an end to all of this western pennsylvania bias
8854423 if you have 598 football playing schools now there is a better argument to lets go to six classes
8854424 lets go to 100 in each class and shorten the season by one week too
8854425 and i think it is going to be awesome again this season so to be able to come out and see how we actually can do in the piaa is really exciting its a great opportunity for us
8854426 we assured our members that they are under a microscope down there because everybody knows how they operated in the past
8854427 they are under such a tight microscope that anything that they do people are going to question it
8854428 those are things that we will have to rely on each individual administrator in each of our schools to make sure of
8854429 the integrity of the coaches has to be kept in check as well
8854430 we want everybody basically playing by the same rules to make sure there is a level playing field
8854431 you talk about academic standards those are certainly some of the best schools in the country
8854432 we are not going to turn anybody down that is going to voluntarily join
8854433 i think the fifth year thing is something the schools could deal with
8854434 in reality most of our schools do not have fifth year seniors
8854435 we are just going to sit tight and see how things unfold
8854436 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners
8854437 i feel like i was extremely justified to do what i did
8854438 i needed to do it and thats the way it went lets make it real clear i am not apologizing for it and thats that
8854439 i dont think there is a right or a wrong i dont think there are any rules
8854440 usually when a team gets a big play on you its because people arent doing what theyre supposed to do and blown assignments on the field
8854441 a lot more people are focused and want to do the job
8854442 coach told us after the game last year that were bringing basically the whole team back
8854443 if we make the same mistakes the outcome will not change
8854444 we have more depth and we have more experience so this is a much better team from start to finish
8854445 our football iq is much better our nucleus is strong this year and should be even stronger next year
8854446 im anxious to see what we have were not going to have as many freshmen on the field which will be a big bonus
8854447 mathis kan du ikke lige tie stille i 2 minutter
8854448 recent shifts in the release dates of other pictures created an opportunity for us
8854449 burying the 2008 yankees has become too darn easy like practicing layups on an eight foot rim or beating a 4 year old at checkers
8854450 if you are a yankee in 2008 the red sox are your daddy
8854451 they have some talented and dangerous people in their backfield
8854452 he has a very good arm great feet he makes things happen
8854453 we are still in first we still control what happens well be ok no one in here is worrying
8854454 everything was 100 percent focused on the game at hand i think we take that into consideration
8854455 if i had to put a one two three on my question marks
8854456 we do have a depth problem on the offensive line no question about that
8854457 when 32 year old megan santos of riverview fla noticed that one of her baby daughters eyes was a slightly different color than the other her intuition told her that something was wrong
8854458 after i put the picture up she saw it and she sent me a private e mail in which she said that rowan might have retinoblastoma in her left eye
8854459 she said not to worry you but i think you should look at this web site
8854460 her prognosis is good as far as the doctor can tell
8854461 the cancer had not yet reached her optic nerve which would have then brought it directly to her brain
8854462 i thought he had been playing well enough where he could sit this one out
8854463 i was thinking of that when i decided to sit him
8854464 i cant think of another time right off the top of my head maybe there was one
8854465 i already told donovan hes going to hear from my lawyer
8854466 a guy of his stature in the community should be aware of others feelings here he is making me feel ashamed of something that i cant control
8854467 really this is one of the reasons why i will enjoy playing for this team when your leader is that kind of guy who doesnt allow you to take football too seriously its a lot of fun when you talk about me desean and westbrook were all no higher than 5 10 and im the tallest among the three so i feel pretty good about that
8854468 the head coaches dont run the teams in the national football league
8854469 in the old days if guys got into a fight it was who won
8854470 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
8854471 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it
8854472 its sad to see it go but i think itll be fun to move to the new stadium
8854473 dale youre startin to piss me off you need to toughen up bub

8854484 i have never seen persecution so bad in my life and i have seen a lot of opposition to the gospel over the years said yohannan
8854485 the christians in orissa have fled for their lives into the forests and some have been in hiding for three days without food or water said yohannan
8854486 several of our pastors are in the forest along with their church people and one said that he could have escaped but would rather die with his people than leave them
8854487 so it is no surprise that opposition is increasing he added

8854491 if the united states had genuine broadband competition internet providers would not be able to profit from artificial scarcity they would invest in their networks to keep pace with consumer demand unfortunately americans will continue to face the consequences of this lack of competition until policymakers get serious about policies that deliver the world class networks consumers deserve
8854492 when a government makes a promise to the country and then reneges on its promise then not only will the government lose credibility but also any respect that the public may have for it
8854493 i do not often agree with malaysia today net and website editor raja petra kamaruddin he had been sometimes quite irresponsible
8854494 but court action had already been taken against him he is not above the law and if he is found guilty there are already adequate punishment that can be passed against him
8854495 it is also a desperate act by the bn government that is still reeling fromits repeated defeats and refusing to listen to the clear signals demonstrated by the rakyat time and again via the ballot box the grounds given that malaysia today is a seditious website are completely baseless and unfounded in any principle of law given that there are ample laws which govern such activities and there has yet to be a single court in all of malaysia that has found the website to contain seditious content
8854496 pkr calls upon the mcmc and the government to keep its promise to the msc and to immediately revoke this order and resist any temptation to arrogantly show callous disregard for the right of malaysians to access alternative information

8854533 i dont know enough about it but im going to look into it
8854534 i read about it in a magazine article we might revisit it as a mix up play

8854549 and second of all we will like to go down as not losing but having a winning season
8854550 we will be the first team to ever play varsity football
8854551 thirty years from now we can look back and say yeah we did ok
8854552 you win a game by using the sound fundamentals that we do or by doing our best
8854553 when you watch someone play it makes you want to get in
8854554 my wife says the same thing when were in bed mary ellen is on the verge of losing someone very close to her and instead of blogging she is on death watch
8854555 not that i would know directly i no longer read her blog but that is another story
8854556 honestly this is such a personal attack i find it really cruel distasteful and pathetic
8854557 to be honest me and i have not spoken in months we had our own issues which sadly have not been resolved
8854558 that said as a human being with a heart that beats and some basic level of respect and compassion i cannot sit silently and read this then click on
8854559 i am sure this will go unnoticed by me as she is in a hospice somewhere waiting for a death that might have already come
8854560 if you dont want to approve that comment fine by me

8854565 you dont want there to be any questions if they want to know you have the answer right there
8854566 they just wanted to see tapes of the first few games from my senior season before making a decision on an offer at delaware i ran a 4 39 40 they said it was enough and i did well in their cornerback running back drills
8854567 i wouldnt say i felt like i had to have this done by the end of the summer i just wanted more interest and hopefully some good offers you never know what can happen in the season with regard to injury ive developed a good relationship with the delaware coaches its where i want to be
8854568 they have some talented and dangerous people in their backfield
8854569 he has a very good arm great feet he makes things happen
8854570 we kind of thought that adding the catholic league was the one last missing piece that we wanted
8854571 we stayed away from our championships being considered a true state championship because the whole state wasnt represented
8854572 we are now at the point that we can say it is a true state championship
8854573 i think this is a great opportunity for us to show what we are all about
8854574 and maybe we can put an end to all of this western pennsylvania bias
8854575 if you have 598 football playing schools now there is a better argument to lets go to six classes
8854576 lets go to 100 in each class and shorten the season by one week too
8854577 and i think it is going to be awesome again this season so to be able to come out and see how we actually can do in the piaa is really exciting its a great opportunity for us
8854578 we assured our members that they are under a microscope down there because everybody knows how they operated in the past
8854579 they are under such a tight microscope that anything that they do people are going to question it
8854580 those are things that we will have to rely on each individual administrator in each of our schools to make sure of
8854581 the integrity of the coaches has to be kept in check as well
8854582 we want everybody basically playing by the same rules to make sure there is a level playing field
8854583 you talk about academic standards those are certainly some of the best schools in the country
8854584 we are not going to turn anybody down that is going to voluntarily join
8854585 i think the fifth year thing is something the schools could deal with
8854586 in reality most of our schools do not have fifth year seniors
8854587 we are just going to sit tight and see how things unfold
8854588 thats why i have to stay away i havent gone to any practices didnt go to camp theyre trying to inch me back ah just go watch for a half hour thats not my style
8854589 somebody will come in to replace me and pretty soon ill be forgotten thats fine with me thats the way i want it
8854590 i understand what vince is always saying to me john youve done it all what more is there to do we had some great times i just know im going to miss the kids from west to northeast to frankford to washington man so many great kids they gave so much theyd do anything for me just like id do anything for them
8854591 maybe afterward ill go see everybody but during the game no cant do that too hard you wont see me on the sideline ill be up in the stands just watching
8854592 i just dont get intimidated by bigger players ive always been this way
8854593 every football team i played with for 10 years with the frankford chargers youth program through 2006 i was always the smallest didnt let it bother me couldnt be scared about it i always showed the most heart
8854594 about 60 percent of our kids had never played football we stuck to the basics
8854595 everybody was concerned i could see it when they talked to me
8854596 made me feel good anybody that asked i told them what was going on i was worried especially because i didnt have any problems before the physical but dealing with it got better as time went on
8854597 the doctors said he was drinking too many sodas with caffeine
8854598 they kept him out through the winter to be sure but once he stopped drinking so much caffeine everything got back to normal they cleared him in april
8854599 i still have a regular soda every so often but mostly its water or fruit juices
8854600 we have some talent though i think were on the right path
8854601 we have a 14 year old freshman enrique garcia who goes 6 3 280 and is going to be one of the best around
8854602 so im sitting at a red light behind another car at the intersection of martel and beverly at about 12 15 a m a few days ago as soon as the light turned talking about a fraction of a second here this old fart in a beat up green camry starts to honk at me and the driver in front to start moving it wasnt even a light tap of the horn which would have been ridiculous in and of itself i was like you gotta be kidding me right so what would you do i purposely drove slower than i normally would while i was making my left turn i saw this angry old man riding my bumper so close that i could see the scowl on his ugly face then get this he starts tailgating me for a whole 2 blocks 2 blocks before making a right off of beverly its past midnight and the roads are completely empty wheres the fire did you really need to travel 2 blocks that badly
8854603 weve been calling this a shallow recession and the data today tend to support that view
8854604 but that doesnt mean they point toward a quicker recovery either
8854605 going forward whether core measures of cpi excluding food and energy would show signs of inflation would be the key factor in determining the bank of japans actions
8854606 he is a genius and my tactics against him didnt work
8854607 today is the day that nigeria shows argentina how soccer is really played
8854608 it will be interesting to hear from the prosecutor when he will be able to have this new indictment
8854609 in terms of finding out about the beginning of the trial that will be vital

8854630 the overriding priority especially in baku tbilisi and kyiv will be the same a clear and simple message that the united states has a deep and abiding interest in the well being and security in this part of the world
8854631 has clearly taken on increased importance in light of russias recent military operations and its decision to recognize unilaterally the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8854632 reaffirm americas unwavering commitment to continue strengthening our relations with these countries not just today but for the long haul
8854633 russias actions in recent weeks have clearly cast grave doubts on its intentions its purposes and its reliability as an international partner
8854634 it is critically important at this time of uncertainty that we are consulting and coordinating very closely with our friends especially those who literally are living in the shadow of russias recent power play
8854635 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8854636 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8854637 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8854638 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8854639 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8854640 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8854641 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8854642 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8854643 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8854644 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8854645 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8854646 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8854647 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8854648 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8854649 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8854650 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8854651 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8854652 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8854653 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8854654 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8854655 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8854656 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8854657 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8854658 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8854659 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8854660 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8854661 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8854662 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8854663 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8854664 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8854665 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8854666 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8854667 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8854668 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8854669 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8854670 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8854671 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8854672 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8854673 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8854674 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8854675 no one works for someone we all just work together
8854676 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8854677 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8854678 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8854679 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8854680 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8854681 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8854682 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8854683 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8854684 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8854685 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8854686 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8854687 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8854688 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8854689 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8854690 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8854691 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8854692 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8854693 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8854694 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8854695 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8854696 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8854697 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8854698 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8854699 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8854700 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8854701 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8854702 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8854703 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8854704 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8854705 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8854706 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8854707 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8854708 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8854709 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8854710 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8854711 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8854712 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8854713 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8854714 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8854715 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8854716 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8854717 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8854718 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8854719 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8854720 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8854721 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8854722 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8854723 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8854724 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8854725 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8854726 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8854727 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8854728 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8854729 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8854730 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8854731 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8854732 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

8854740 the gt gt gt gt gt mountain loomed over him
8854741 the lake beckoned him to a refershing gt gt gt gt gt swim
8854742 i know theres always a situation when an individual may commit some act that isnt favourable
8854743 if he extends himself to commit an act of bravery it doesnt mean you have to wipe the honour out
8854744 the information simply came in to us and we were in a position to act on it in a very quick manner
8854745 ive seen so many over my lifetime that these ones are just run of the mill
8854746 the initial responders the patrol members were willing to pitch in and help out
8854747 we havent done the full computer forensics thats going to take at least a couple of months for us to actually get to them
8854748 this falls far short its not what the need is in calgary the need is growing its not shrinking it is not as far as we need to go when we look at the toll on this community
8854749 the only way to curtail the crime and drug activity in this city and region is to get on it to have a goal alberta should be gang free focus on it just as weve done with rats
8854750 i dont know how much more detailed and how much more of a compelling argument we can put forward if we dont arrest the bad guys and keep arresting them when is the message going to go out to this community loud and clear that were serious about law and order
8854751 there are 400 plus individuals of interest to the calgary police service wreaking havoc in this community if we dont get on them sooner its only a matter of time before some innocent bystander gets caught in the crossfire and i dont want to see that happen
8854752 this is not just about calgary it is a problem that is growing and if we dont deal with it in calgary guess what the gangs set up shop in the neighbouring communities
8854753 i would have liked to have given the direction to the chief of police to get hiring there are over 400 people in the queue ready to start working for the calgary police service
8854754 obviously we have to go back and look at the plan what do we give up
8854755 sounds like the tories are being soft on crime would this have been easy for them to do of course it would have been easy lets get cops on the streets to battle these scumbags and rats
8854756 i put my kids in their hands to watch them and he gets hurt

8854760 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8854761 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8854762 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8854763 after that 2004 fiesta bowl everybody knows who the university of utah is
8854764 certainly the university of utah is much more of a household name now
8854765 of course michigan is a well known big team across the nation
8854766 we respect them as an opponent but im not going to be intimidated by them just because theyre the university of michigan
8854767 i thought it was going to be a big towering structure but when we got there it was kind of underwhelming when it fills in its magnificent and they have an incredible program and tradition but in the end were all football players fighting for the same thing
8854768 there are a lot of veterans here and weve been in a lot of tough situations
8854769 we arent going to let a lot of people or a big stadium affect us

8854771 we believe that the release of the four is the results of the persistent and continuous campaigns to demand for the abolition of the isa
8854772 gmi reiterates that punishing or detaining people without giving them any opportunity to defend themselves is barbaric
8854773 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8854774 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8854775 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8854790 it is now almost three weeks since the bodies of xi zhou and zhen xing yang were discovered
8854791 since then officers have been working tirelessly to catch their killers
8854792 they have been examining forensic evidence cctv mobile phone and banking records computer and website data
8854793 we are building a picture of xi zhou and zhen xing yang and possible motives behind their deaths
8854794 i hope that anybody who has information and has yet to come forward will see the new appeal and contact my officers

8854830 i am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now i am recording the sound of my speaking voice and i am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce themselves so that any semblance of my speech with perhaps the exception of rhythm is destroyed what you will hear then are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech i regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have
8854831 i think the fans will be great there were some great years and great memories that he was a part of
8854832 were going to put season ticketholders back in their original seats
8854833 the team spent the session continuing set up preparations for the grand prix
8854834 will join us this evening to take over from nico tomorrow
8854835 we are putting a lot of effort into finding the right settings on the car for this track
8854836 on top of that we are obviously paying careful attention to reliability and the way the car behaves over the kerbs an aspect of the package that saw us in difficulty last year i think we are working well even if we will only have the first real confirmation of this after qualifying for the italian grand prix
8854837 it was a busy day as we tried lots of different settings on the car to try and improve the overall balance
8854838 once we were happy with the basic set up we did some work on the brakes as this circuit is very demanding in that area we found out some interesting things and learnt quite a lot about how the car behaves with low downforce the track conditions were not too bad and it was quite consistent which is always useful when you are testing
8854839 and again we had good reliability from the car which was pleasing because the engineers could get straight down to the programme without any interruptions we had quite a long test list to get through today looking at aerodynamic tweaks brake testing and some set up work the results look quite encouraging and have given us good direction for tomorrow
8854840 i felt comfortable in the car and we could do a lot of laps and found some items that will help us move forward and prepare for the race here we had some work to do to find a good set up that works over the kerbs and in the slow corners without losing time on braking or on the straights and also trying to get a good setup with the inertia dampers we made some good steps forward that will also help us at next weeks belgian grand prix so i am happy and feel quite prepared for these coming races
8854841 with adrian evaluating set up options and wing levels for the italian grand prix
8854842 these have been a couple of useful days preparing not just for the italian grand prix but also the other races starting with
8854843 the team including the renault crew did a good job and we got through a lot of work in terms of data id say the first day produced more useful information than today but overall a good test and im now looking forward to belgium
8854844 we concentrated mainly on the important things for this track which are an efficient aerodynamic set up good braking feel and the need to feel comfortable over the kerbs im satisfied with progress
8854845 we carried on with the programme that we started yesterday
8854846 concentrating on set up and tyre work and doing more experimentation with the brakes and brake balance that was the main thrust of the schedule it all went to plan we didnt run with low fuel and we achieved everything we were aiming at we changed an engine but that was for homologation purposes and was scheduled
8854847 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8854848 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8854849 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8854850 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8854851 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8854852 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8854853 the response weve gotten from the public has been fantastic
8854854 just love everybody that interacts with you no matter how personally or how peripherally involved with you they are the efficiency of the people who deal with you everything is orchestrated by the manager called
8854855 since the employees and contract labourers had left the plant late last night so it was a conscious decision of the company that there would be no attendance at the project site at any of the three shifts today
8854856 i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made
8854857 its a thriller thats thought provoking and still a pretty good yarn
8854858 not too much speechifying somewhere betweenthe bourne identity and syriana
8854859 i dont like to do research if i have to do a lot theres usually something missing from the script its the writers job to do research and jeffrey nachmanoff did a ton of it
8854860 what interested me was how similar the monotheistic religions are the same players just talked about and viewed differently
8854861 most people just want to get through the day make some money take care of their family be happy and safe its their leaders who push these agendas
8854862 sometimes it hard to do a softer ver sion of an accent rather than a fullblown one
8854863 director jeffrey nachmanoff indicated that clayton is from the south hes educated and hes left my dialect coach tim monich travels around finds locals and interviews them and has this incredible library its just brilliant you can say tennessee well educated hasnt been there for a long time and hell send you a bunch of cds
8854864 im physical its fun to do physical stuff instead of yelling cut and bringing in a stuntman
8854865 i wanted to be a stuntman before i became an actor what changed my mind i think i got smart
8854866 i look for characters that are real with aspects i can relate to that spark my imagination i like to be involved in things that make people think that sometimes pushes people out of their comfort zone
8854867 to do the job you have to get your ego out of the way
8854868 you have to trust people let them help you do your job the actors have to make the characters come to life to make them their characters not my characters
8854869 there was a lot of spirited debate with jeffrey about the script on traitor
8854870 ultimately i had to concentrate on being an actor and let him concentrate on being a director
8854871 directors often feel like they need to be directing all the time as if you hadnt read the script or anything
8854872 but im ready the day after i read the script i dont need to be told what my motivation is im a bit of a control freak some directors say thats great if youre self reliant its one lessthing they have to worry about
8854873 getting behind the camera interests me but years of raising money and gathering people together doesnt
8854874 i see things that could be done better and say uh excuse me how about doing this this and this to fix a problem im really aware of time being wasted on film sets
8854875 when you make a movie you have to make certain logical leaps
8854876 its the language of cinema all sorts of short cuts like when an actor picks up a phone in a movie he doesnt say uh hello this is so and so hi how are ya he says something that moves the plot forward sometimes the needs of storytelling stretch the reality you have to concentrate realism in the first part of the film you get more license in the second and third acts by then youre into it you dont care if you wanted to actually watch reality youd watch whats going on in the streets
8854877 the fact that don was doing traitor and was a producer helped me decide to do it
8854878 its put my career on a trajectory that i like
8854879 film is a difficult medium to address issues you cant get into it the way you want to get into it i want to entertain first and then smuggle in more thoughtful material were not issue based i like ridiculous pratfall comedies too
8854880 i dont want to shoot anywhere besides los angeles and in making los angeles look like wherever were supposed to be filming
8854881 id like to vacation in russia spain cameroon but not with a movie camera i dont like working four months away from home we used to pack up the kids and take everybody along but theyre of an age now where theyve got their own lives and its not fair to dragthem away from that
8854882 do any of these two artists need really an introduction i dont think so both are big shots in the world of experimental music early 2003 shortly after the re discovery of the hafler trio the trio did a performance in preston called how to slice a loaf of bread the performance was attended by colin potter who lives and works in the same city afterwards it was suggested that the two should work together but mckenzie being iceland and potter in preston made a tete a tete not easy andrew mckenzie mailed colin potter the original source materials for the concert which potter happily reworked into a pressed on sandwich the original performance was also released so there is something to compare both the hafler trio and colin potter are masters of drone music but there are some subtle differences the hafler trio seem overall more monochrome in approach with so it seems for the listener who doesnt know any better whereas potter seems to be using more sound effects to create the soundscapes that he does maybe less organic and more electronic as said the differences are quite subtle here and there is certainly no hierarchy both are masters of the genre potters mix is perhaps a bit more dense and obviously more concise the hafler trio release spans three cds but it moves as gentle and dark as the original great collaboration
8854883 psychic space invasion is ian holloways main project and pendulum is already the eighth release by this project if i understand correctly
8854884 you dont want there to be any questions if they want to know you have the answer right there
8854885 they just wanted to see tapes of the first few games from my senior season before making a decision on an offer at delaware i ran a 4 39 40 they said it was enough and i did well in their cornerback running back drills
8854886 i wouldnt say i felt like i had to have this done by the end of the summer i just wanted more interest and hopefully some good offers you never know what can happen in the season with regard to injury ive developed a good relationship with the delaware coaches its where i want to be
8854887 a walk in the woods a photographic study of arkansas
8854888 if you see pickled watermelon rind for sale chances are good its ours
8854889 we were bumping up against the farmers market which gets bigger and bigger
8854890 and we decided that moving more into the center of downtown would give the festival more visibility and tap into that historic thing well be within walking distance of some of the hotels too
8854891 last year we went 2 200 in the hole but we had dug our way out by december
8854892 we know its so hard right now for our sponsors and donors to contribute so we have cut back on expenses
8854893 back in february buddy was struck by viral encephalitis and almost died
8854894 if he hadnt gotten to a hospital i think we would have lost him
8854895 jimmy had filled in for buddy when he was on the cruise
8854896 and hes from a musical family where his dad plays guitar and his mother plays bass and jimmy played drums with them so hes equally proficient on drums bass and guitar and a darn good singer he was influenced by both stevie ray vaughan and john mayer so hes into blues and rock and pop and hes a great country picker too
8854897 it was the first time we played at the arkansas river blues festival in 87 or 88
8854898 confessed that in 1961 and 1962 he would go absent without leave from his army base to catch shortys performances
8854899 there are records that just dont ask for more than their sheer existence and that people play hundreds of times without any real reason simply content of keeping them functioning in that fragment of time in which theyre enjoyed
8854900 i dont know im not a bat maker and im not a termite so i cant tell you whats good wood and whats bad wood
8854901 im happy to see manny i respect him in my career barry bonds and ramirez have been the two best of my time
8854902 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength
8854903 ladies and gentlemen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
8854904 i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
8854905 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8854906 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8854907 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8854908 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
8854909 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over sign in before you can post messages

8854911 they are the bosses they are the ones that run the team and they know what is best for us
8854912 sometimes we just have to stay back and watch even though as an athlete you are very competitive and you want to be there every time but its not that easy we play 162 games and they are trying to do what is smartest for the team so when september comes we can all be ready to go
8854913 all you can do is keep your fingers crossed and do what you can do
8854914 his past three or four times out there down there i understand he was throwing real good
8854915 his command was good he was pitching much better we figured that that is going to be pretty tough on him to pitch him 2 or 3 days in a row
8854916 i dont want to say i wasnt wanted but i kind of got dismissed
8854917 but the best thing is he didnt send me somewhere that doesnt mean anything he sent me to a playoff contending team and ill be forever grateful
8854918 the committee was very disappointed in ms rileys actions and felt that the fighting situation was in violation of the principles of fair play and sportsmanship that are so important in our championship
8854919 lets just say my foots got caught in the door

8854923 the afp has concluded its active inquiries although some long standing overseas inquiries are yet to be fully resolved
8854924 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8854925 i think hes one of the top quarterbacks in the country
8854926 i think he can create a lot of problems for people this year
8854927 hes that double threat of being a runner and a passer he knows where to go with the football what true freshman backup chris whitney didnt have last year was that ability yet to read a defense antwon brings that back
8854928 he can also scramble make some plays that way hes experienced and hes a winner
8854929 he can do a lot of different things to make it happen he worked hard to come back even stronger and faster
8854930 i was actually excited to get into camp just to be able to run around and compete in drills again
8854931 you can get a feel of things from the sideline but sitting outs pretty tough all my friends were out there the quarterbacks supposed to be the leader i felt like i kind of let our team down a little bit because we were doing pretty good
8854932 i actually feel a lot better than i did before the injury ive been working out with the trainers and strength and conditioning coaches through the summer a lot of lower body things im running harder its great
8854933 i cant think about the injury throughout the rehab ive worked on my agility i probably improved on some things im capable of leading the team i feel like im ready for anything
8854934 in high school i really never ran i joke with the coaches a lot that i really dont like to run but when things open up i guess im starting to enjoy becoming a runner
8854935 now i kind of get yelled at every once in awhile if i pitch it
8854936 he worked together with visionaire all the time and i didnt know who was the better one
8854937 hopefully the light will go on when he comes around the turn into the stretch
8854938 he can get distracted in the littlest of ways hopefully by next year he can be a nice handicap horse and become even better
8854939 he got a little body sore so we backed off a little bit and were just jogging him through the woods he looks like hes about ready to get back to galloping again
8854940 the first day i got back i went into my local bagel shop later identified as delrans bagel cafe and they treated me to a free breakfast
8854941 later on that day i went to the medport diner in medford and they gave me a free lunch its been cool you can tell its really been exciting for everybody some people more than others
8854942 people here are just so happy for her that for us it really is the least we can do
8854943 for many of us it was like watching your own daughter everyone in the community has just been so touched by what she has done
8854944 its been nice to be home and relax but i never get tired of training
8854945 it was great to go out with a bang at the olympics but i know i have to get better every day so im ready to get started
8854946 i found it on the agenda of the board meeting for consideration
8854947 we had previously discussed the matter and if they were aware or not i dont know
8854948 i felt from the bottom of my heart that it was improper to deal with a cabinet minister in such business because we had visited a neighbouring country where a similar incident had happened and the fund had been put on a lot of political pressure
8854949 i am not constrained at all and i can say exactly what i said then but what i mean is that the context was slightly changed
8854950 why did you rush into such a high class transaction it was meant for long term investment but was expedited so quickly what could have been the matter
8854951 we had a lot of money to spend so we could not wait
8854952 mr md did you as an auditor know that what you were engaging in was wrong and did you in your mind know that there was a road called old port bell road
8854953 nssf has always been used in the same way and the new management is falling under the same trap mr mbabazi should have used at least the companys name in obtaining the money and so we shall have to summon him to explain
8854954 since parliament started investigating nssf our efforts are being circumvented by an unholy alliance between nssf and akright where akright is trying to say that we have no point
8854955 i get an impression that what akright is doing is contempt of parliament they are trying to water down what we are doing the chairman should guide us on whether this does not tantamount to contempt of parliament
8854956 but as a return man he sure looks like hes got a little zip to him
8854957 the next time if it did happen again like that id probably let that one go
8854958 the two new cyber shot phones that we have announced today share certain characteristics both phones place ease of use and best in class picture quality at the heart of their designs
8854959 yet both appeal to different audiences one is engineered to let you take more pictures in more places and the other is designed to look as stunning as the pictures it takes
8854960 to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our lineup did against ryan dempster
8854961 it was one of those days where it wasnt going where i wanted it to go
8854962 we got in a situation where we couldnt get people out
8854963 thats why i have to stay away i havent gone to any practices didnt go to camp theyre trying to inch me back ah just go watch for a half hour thats not my style
8854964 somebody will come in to replace me and pretty soon ill be forgotten thats fine with me thats the way i want it
8854965 i understand what vince is always saying to me john youve done it all what more is there to do we had some great times i just know im going to miss the kids from west to northeast to frankford to washington man so many great kids they gave so much theyd do anything for me just like id do anything for them
8854966 maybe afterward ill go see everybody but during the game no cant do that too hard you wont see me on the sideline ill be up in the stands just watching
8854967 im not really worried about whats going to go on
8854968 the coaches they have a lot of decisions to make all around the board not just me just put it in gods hands i just played real hard just left it all out on the field thats been my whole attitude throughout the preseason
8854969 its good when you can just turn it over to god and go out there and play
8854970 take everything else out of it and just go out there its football you grow up playing football your whole life and its supposed to be fun its not supposed to be like eating dirt or whatever sometimes when you put a lot of pressure on yourself you take the fun out of it i really feel like ive turned the corner
8854971 now well go back evaluate the film and make the cuts i thought there were some guys here who really showed well for themselves there were other guys that didnt
8854972 it was my first start although its just the preseason and the starters werent out there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8854973 i just dont get intimidated by bigger players ive always been this way
8854974 every football team i played with for 10 years with the frankford chargers youth program through 2006 i was always the smallest didnt let it bother me couldnt be scared about it i always showed the most heart
8854975 about 60 percent of our kids had never played football we stuck to the basics
8854976 everybody was concerned i could see it when they talked to me
8854977 made me feel good anybody that asked i told them what was going on i was worried especially because i didnt have any problems before the physical but dealing with it got better as time went on
8854978 the doctors said he was drinking too many sodas with caffeine
8854979 they kept him out through the winter to be sure but once he stopped drinking so much caffeine everything got back to normal they cleared him in april
8854980 i still have a regular soda every so often but mostly its water or fruit juices
8854981 we have some talent though i think were on the right path
8854982 we have a 14 year old freshman enrique garcia who goes 6 3 280 and is going to be one of the best around
8854983 we have a good team and well go up there with the idea of playing well
8854984 our guys are going to be super juiced i know i will
8854985 we made a majority of the home games the last 2 years when wally started
8854986 id be lying if i said this wasnt a special game to me we get a chance to play in front of more than 100 000 people in the same stadium that my brother played in i never would have imagined something like this when i was younger
8854987 i dont get back to penn state as often as i would have liked mainly because i became a college coach after i finished playing in the nfl
8854988 a lot of those reunions happen during football season so for me it was almost impossible
8854989 they did have a reunion of our teams a few years back i was going to go but i was coaching at the university of connecticut then and tv switched the time of our kickoff from noon to 7 30 p m so that took care of that
8854990 i know jack ham will be there because he does the radio broadcasts for penn state
8854991 i havent gotten a full list of those attending but chuck burkhart and steve smear are in charge of that so theyll be there for sure i heard pete johnson is coming too
8854992 im hoping mike reid comes back and franco harris ted kwalick i want to see them all and it goes without saying of course that i have the deepest respect for my old coach joe paterno
8854993 i liked the idea of playing a team that has so much tradition and support
8854994 penn state does things the right way at coastal we feel that thats what were doing we have a successful program and not just in terms of winning football games to an extent weve modeled our program very much after the penn states of the world
8854995 i told our guys theyd better not get caught looking around with their mouths wide open or they could get embarrassed
8854996 i had never played safety before corner is my natural position
8854997 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8854998 i dont like it the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8854999 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular time needs that
8855000 come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco at first
8855001 its armageddon baseball is a game of human error it always has been and always will be why would you want to take that away i think its dumb
8855002 they should remove two rows of seats in the rightfield stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in leftfield 12 feet that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the 8 foot wall
8855003 they should put wind screens up in the gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and right center
8855004 its the only sign weve missed all year and you only have to look for one thing
8855005 its going out there every game every win is crucial
8855006 all of a sudden you come into this scenario from where i was coming from

8855009 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength

8855021 this is not a comfortable position to be in i am a democrat
8855022 once the legislative council takes its role it can approve cancel or amend any of the plan
8855023 we cannot create a legal vacuum because of the absence of the legislative council
8855024 this level of concentration of powers has not existed ever in the history of the palestinian authority not even during arafats time
8855025 during arafats time we had a functioning legislative council now the council is not functioning at all and the executive is more powerful were losing oversight
8855026 the absence of opposition within the system within the process is dangerous
8855027 not made any effort to coordinate with members of the legislative council not even with democrats or fatah members
8855028 how could people who were presented as democrats practice such an authoritarian approach
8855029 being put forward now as fast as possible to take advantage of the time left before any change in this government

8855041 right from the days of the great depression era in the usa it has been seen that if inflation is high the expense on entertainment goes up
8855042 besides inflation the other challenges that the entertainment sector faces are quality content difficulty in increasing ticket prices and contracting peoples costs
8855043 there definitely has been a reduction in the occupancy rate and the footfalls have gone down adding to the woes of distributors and exhibitors
8855044 the past six months have been slow for the film industry but it will be premature to attribute that to inflation
8855045 there have been just three hits out of the 33 films released
8855046 every year we expect a 7 per cent increment so we hike the ticket rates accordingly
8855047 most of the films which are already in production will not be impacted but the ones that are going to be launched will require a bit of budget reshuffling
8855048 as the pressure on spending on leisure is felt more at that level
8855049 by the way has anyone seen a movie starring mahendra khan in 1947 rock on 9 am tomorrow yay
8855050 n o farei o papel de bill mas li o roteiro e a hist ria muito humana que est ao cerne do filme me comoveu muito
8855051 the county could stand good for the debts until the 15th and take their money out of it when the money transfers
8855052 but they take a risk if for some reason the money doesnt transfer and in this short budget time theyre going to be very reluctant to do that
8855053 that would be a constitutional gift and we cant gift those teachers because they do not work for us and they are not county employees we cannot just pay their payroll
8855054 i gave them my insurance card and its suspended and everything had to be paid out of my pocket
8855055 were going to miss this if you dont come here
8855056 tell em to blow off this recipe show no just do it
8855057 you know when you go into that g meth world
8855058 i cant do nothing about it its they world they make it up in your head they do it
8855059 we want to get people used to the trains now
8855060 yeah ive never seen a train on it and i see all kinds of people using it
8855061 its easier than walking all the way around to a crosswalk
8855062 it sounds like a lot of money but to run a campaign like this thats really very little
8855063 you have to have enough money which today would be 500 000 or 600 000 for these guys democratic candidates and its a tremendous advantage to the incumbent because the incumbent is known
8855064 while we always want more we have more resources than any other candidate in this race
8855065 what i have heard most often is the students couldnt hide among a lot of other students
8855066 the teachers knew what they needed to learn and i think that made a big difference
8855067 one of the most important things that has happened in arizona education in a long time
8855068 but when two types are mixed one contaminates the other reducing the value of the material or requiring resources to separate them before processing
8855069 most plastic bottles are baled for transport and if they dont crack when baled the ones with tightly fastened lids can explode when the temperature increases
8855070 if this isnt the biggest event in the monsoon season its right up there
8855071 when you get enough heat and certain conditions are just right its like breaking though a roof
8855072 its the worse storm ive ever seen and ive lived here my entire life
8855073 the tree wasnt split in half it was completely uprooted
8855074 the show on the stage is nothing compared to the one in the sky
8855075 it was about as windy as god would want it to be for judas priest
8855076 our parents raised us to believe that the earth isnt ours to take but ours to take care of
8855077 we will be working together to implement more sustainable practices to the already impressive lineup
8855078 run errands together instead of on multiple trips walk to local attractions shop at farmers markets use energy efficient light bulbs
8855079 i dont think the plaintiff had a fair opportunity to present its case and id like to give them the opportunity do that
8855080 its our job to make sure their voices are heard
8855081 the caller said he was witnessing a car that wasnt supposed to be on the road and had illegal plates
8855082 this has the potential to change a lot but there needs to be more research into this
8855083 it was the realization that we had the tools and technology that we could do something that nobody else thought possible
8855084 frequently we have mixture samples that are nothing more than dna soup and we cant make heads or tails of it
8855085 this sounds like it could be a very helpful development for forensic scientists in dealing with a very tricky problem
8855086 may have dire consequences and privacy issues related to protecting individuals
8855087 it is kind of cool kind of exciting for the field but it is a matter of practicality and legality whether this would be acceptable in a court and the cost
8855088 they will be able to see a lot more peoples dna is that good or bad it makes life more complicated for the investigator in a way

8855095 i have two years left and i can still get my degree
8855096 im just trying to win ballgames and win a championship
8855097 i was just trying to keep him from turning on himself really
8855098 i always wondered when i got on the field with him what i would find out i didnt know what i know now is hes a very poised player who had some bad things happen to him and around him and handled it with class in my opinion
8855099 he took a lot of the younger guys especially the young quarterbacks under his wing and guided them a lot
8855100 with a lot of situations sometimes things get blown out of proportion
8855101 sometimes its just the people you surround yourself with we felt a change of scenery would be good for him and it turned out it has he hasnt done one thing wrong hes walked a straight and narrow line were pleased with him so far
8855102 hes one of the best athletes ive eve been around
8855103 our focus right now is making adjustments and seeing what weve got to do to get better next week
8855104 i want to win a championship and this team wants to win a championship
8855105 from what ive seen tonight we have an opportunity to win a championship
8855106 its amazing how well we did the past couple of years considering how many guys we had that hated football
8855107 there were all stars on our team who absolutely hated coming to the stadium every day
8855108 coach stew treats us like men he shows us respect
8855109 you can go talk to him whenever you want if you tried to go up and have a conversation with coach rod it felt weird and uncomfortable
8855110 the deal with coach rodriguez everyone has moved on that situation is long gone
8855111 a few weeks before coach rodriguez left coach stewart and one of the former assistants who ended up leaving for michigan got into it practice
8855112 he and the other coach were really going at it the main thing i remember is that all of the players gathered around coach stew we had his back and not the other coach
8855113 that said a lot about what this team thinks of him
8855114 the biggest problem people had wasnt just that rodriguez left
8855115 it was how he left it was a tough time for everyone
8855116 hed walk in that room and sit in that chair and it was like hed been there before there was no stuttering or stammering there was a confidence about him that permeated throughout the entire room
8855117 each time i looked at billy i never sensed any fear in him that hed be unsuccessful
8855118 i never let it be shown and i never stressed it to the staff or to the team
8855119 but i knew we needed that win for this school and this state id have given my life to win that game that night
8855120 we got to arizona and in my very first press conference i said in a very serious voice we came out here to win we came out here to
8855121 quite frankly there was emotion involved itd be unrealistic to say there wasnt wed just beaten what some said was the best team in the country by 20 points it was our best victory ever and he coached it
8855122 its symbolic of the lives we lead here in this great state
8855123 west virginians are so blue collar and down to earth theyre coal miners and construction workers who put in an honest days work for an honest days pay thats how i was brought up
8855124 west virginians have a feeling and a love for one another thats like no other
8855125 its kind of us against them you know what i mean
8855126 people think were a bunch of hillbillies that live in shacks and trailers well i very proudly spent the first five years of my life in a trailer and someday when i retire ill be back in a trailer if im trailer trash im trailer trash if thats what people think it doesnt bother me
8855127 all i need is to walk into a store and see my dumb face looking back at me ive never thought coaches should be put on pedestals were not presidents or governors were teachers of young men
8855128 i like to treat people nice but this isnt some church camp
8855129 if you cant stay on sides if you have mental busts if you talk back to a coach youre in the bleachers i dont have to say anything i just point to the steps they know as soon as i point they start running
8855130 there wasnt a day on this practice field the last three years where you wouldnt hear at least 150 swear words
8855131 seriously there wasnt a day that went by when that didnt happen now its nothing like that people are having fun
8855132 it is night and day in the past even the staff was walking on eggshells around here you didnt want to do anything wrong now its much more of a laid back and relaxed atmosphere i think it will pay off come game time
8855133 i came to this thing last year when rich rodriguez spoke and he said hed be here for another 20 years
8855134 everyone hates him believe it or not there are a lot of people that think he lost that game against pittsburgh on purpose so he could go ahead and get started at michigan instead of playing in the national title game
8855135 im rooting for two things this season west virginia to win and michigan to lose
8855136 ive got friends that are going to lay down bets against michigan every game
8855137 bill stewart was in the right place at the right time now hes got to capitalize on it i think hell do it
8855138 hes still undefeated hes 1 0 so everyone is behind him
8855139 but you know how fair weather college football fans can be
8855140 but after that after pat white is gone who knows
8855141 thats when well find out what kind of coach he really is
8855142 it has to be someone that sees the big picture someone that can all of a sudden manage a staff that he was probably friends with and very close to before
8855143 theres no sure fire way to know when someone is ready to take that step i think its a feel thing
8855144 bret called me after about two weeks on the job and said you didnt tell me all of this stuff was going to happen
8855145 youve got different things coming across your desk every day that you arent prepared for different decisions you have to make theres a demand on your time all the time
8855146 a lot of assistant coaches dont see that they just know their own little world
8855147 its difficult to get a program where youre winning consistently
8855148 were at that point right now all of the things are in place for it to continue
8855149 i think this michigan man label has been tossed around too much
8855150 to me a michigan man is from my fathers era guys who went to school served in world war ii and came back to school a michigan man is humble has class is a good student served his country and is successful in life
8855151 i like rich rodriguez and am 100 percent behind him and all of the former michigan players i talk to are behind him too i think were going to be successful and win
8855152 sure i guess but its just that the school wants to be the best at what it does academically or athletically michigan state fans used to always call ann arbor arrogant asses but michigan is an outstanding school that ranks up there with ivy league schools
8855153 did they push the panic button it just seems like a strange fit to me a guy like michigan state coach
8855154 i do think you better beat these guys now while they are learning his system because they only will get better and win
8855155 with an outsider coming in we feel like michigan is now a player in the real world
8855156 we were a traditional old program that was insulated and always promoted from within now we are high dollar high stakes program
8855157 i have been to practices and i think too much has been made of the salty language rodriguez and his staff supposedly use
8855158 i heard a lot worse when i played for bo and as for the kid guard
8855159 its no secret that it had become a country club atmosphere the last few years under carr i thought the linemen were out of shape which led to some injuries and not being ready and in shape was a big reason why we lost to appalachian state
8855160 the players attitude has been tremendous as far as working hard and buying into it and also i think from the standpoint of all the questions about a so called outside guy come in ive not heard that at all from my fans
8855161 you have to remember that michigan still has the second best talent in the big ten
8855162 the x factor will be the transition to a new coaching staff and scheme how long that takes to implement will be the key to how well michigan does this fall dont underestimate michigan
8855163 but if he doesnt win people will find stuff to complain about
8855164 there are clearly economic benefits to being in a relationship
8855165 the cost of being single can extend to thousands each year

8855168 during the boom buyers usually accepted the property as is and we even occasionally offered to pay the sellers state and county transfer taxes
8855169 some of these items include availability of high speed internet cost and availability of homeowners insurance
8855170 they cover environmental aspects of the home and neighborhood as well as local services and amenities
8855171 sellers are much more flexible on issues that come up on the home inspection and i mean big ticket items like roofs and furnaces
8855172 and this is after they have already been flexible on the price
8855173 its hard to ask for that after already getting a price reduction
8855174 but its a buyers market and sellers are attuned to that

8855177 i dont want to dwell on it to be honest i would rather talk about the rugby
8855178 i think emotion played a great role on saturday and because of the booing of other people
8855179 its so sad that people dont know the words booing it out
8855180 you could do better if you only applied yourself worked hard stopped answering back just behaved yourself listened to the teacher stopped fidgeting started paying attention stopped talking didnt play with tommy stopped messing around ate your brussels sprouts paid more attention in algebra worked harder
8855181 youre such an idiot im soooo stupid i hate her my bum is fat i look awful ill never make it i cant do that nobody loves me im scared of making a fool of myself i hate my job a glass of wine will make it better im not good enough
8855182 im good at lots of things im intelligent and attractive there are many people in my life that love me im a good person i love being alive my bum is sexy i can achieve anything i set my mind to
8855183 we have strong publishing lists for the second half and beyond and current trading remains in line with our expectations
8855184 the second half has started well with year to date like for like sales 3 ahead of last year and our focus is firmly directed towards maintaining this progress
8855185 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8855186 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8855187 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8855188 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8855189 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8855190 whilst we remain alert to the impact of difficult economic conditions our outlook for the remainder of 2008 remains unchanged

8855277 we want low taxes but we want them to be paid by everyone not just salaried employees and pensioners we will carry on in the same manner because we prefer to be useful rather than temporarily pleasant
8855278 instead of creating an effective system to catch tax dodgers and benefiting from its consequences you are indiscriminately punishing all self employed professionals with a tax of 1 000 euros per head
8855279 our mobile operations achieved dynamic growth and market share gains in all countries

8855283 you will still be able to upgrade to later ie8 builds as they become available but you wont be able to uninstall them
8855284 while you can have a philosophical argument about putting an application in the os there are still a lot of low level hooks between the two
8855285 they increased that with ie 7 because ie 6 was notoriously insecure so this is one of those things where they are trying to do whats right and you got some lock in

8855300 we determined it would be difficult to overthrow the initial ruling
8855301 the continuation of the detachment procedure was a standard medical practice and no negligence is acknowledged on the part of the defendant
8855302 criminal and judicial authorities unreasonably intervened in normal medical operations
8855303 the court pronounced a rational decision as this was a case of a doctor performing a proper medical operation and there was nothing that he could have done to prevent the patients death
8855304 the medical industry should not be content with the acquittal but look into the case from various perspectives and voluntarily start efforts toward prevention of a recurrence
8855305 we have a three year plan which is going to cause us to focus on building the business for the long term its our hope well build value and well be out there acting as one of the consolidators

8855311 after all this they are still my brothers i wish them the best
8855312 i still believe this case should have went before a military court for the simple fact that military jurors have an easier time understanding what happens in combat

8855327 has the potential to end widespread hunger in drought prone areas of sub saharan africa
8855328 land degradation is particularly acute in sub saharan africa where the soil has been overused coupled with low unpredictable rainfall
8855329 with microdosing they dont invest much and that reduces their risk
8855330 reports indicate that land degradation affects more than half of sub saharan africa leading to loss of an estimated 42 billion dollars in income and five million hectares 12 5 million acres of productive land each year
8855331 the majority of farmlands suffer from poor soil fertility due to poor farming techniques nutrient deficiency and lack of water
8855332 thousands of successful experiments across the dryland areas of west and southern africa demonstrate that microdosing can boost yields enough to eliminate the need for food aid
8855333 we do think weve got a lot of relevant products that can offset the concerns that consumers do rightly have

8855339 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8855340 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8855341 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8855342 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8855343 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8855344 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8855345 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8855346 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8855347 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8855348 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8855349 i am keen to hear the views of ratepayers local government and all who have a stake in the future of our rating system people should exercise their right to be heard confident that their comments will be fully considered
8855350 so far the views of ratepayers have made a real impact on the improvement measures being introduced additional relief for pensioners a lone pensioner allowance and a freeze in regional rates liability
8855351 it is clear that devolution makes a real difference by helping local people shape local policies i am committed to taking full account of what local people say before finalising the detail of these new proposals
8855352 this is not a new form of relief nor is it another allowance rather it provides a payment choice allowing rate bills to be conditionally postponed
8855353 in recognition of the difficult decisions involved it is proposed that participants would be made fully aware of the possible financial implications of the scheme before entering into a deferment agreement
8855354 since the return of devolution a priority of the executive is to make a real difference quickly to the most vulnerable ratepayers and pensioners in particular
8855355 while many would like to see the automatic delivery of rating reliefs and allowances this is not possible at present however the new measures would improve the targeting of reliefs and make the verification system easier with automatic delivery remaining a longer term aim
8855356 energy efficient homes will be cheaper to heat more fuel efficient and with the proposed rate rebate save householders money
8855357 i cannot emphasise enough the importance of hearing the views of the northern ireland public i especially want to hear from those who pay the bills year in year out including those who have never responded in the past
8855358 invest ni continued to deliver high private sector investment commitments to strong projects as our clients displayed increasing ambition to achieve the scale necessary to compete effectively in global markets despite some challenging economic conditions
8855359 the results presented in this report reflect not only increasing ambition on the part of our clients but also increasing proactivity by invest ni
8855360 overall we have met or exceeded substantially all of our operating plan targets and continue to witness high levels of interest in our product offerings and range of support programmes

8855365 a waiter told me at the end of a meal that an english tourist presented him with 100 and told him to keep the change
8855366 when the waiter politely told him how much is expected in the states the customer graciously added more to the gratuity to boost it to the 15 level
8855367 however the other english customers darted disapproving looks at him because of the economy globally there has been a decline of restaurant sales and a decline in the more generous gratuities in america beyond the standard 15
8855368 it is a long standing american standard that tipped employees are only paid the current minimum wage so gratuities are vital here
8855369 when researching your holiday destination do read up on the tipping etiquette for that country so that you can factor this into your spending budget
8855370 in some places like the usa giving a little extra is considered really important for example
8855371 familiarising yourself with the tipping culture will lessen your chance of causing offence and stop you spending money unnecessarily do always take some small notes and coins in the local currency just in case
8855372 the new building will provide excellent facilities for the pre school playgroup and after schools club which are run by the local community i am pleased that by working with the local community my department has been able to make this project happen i think it provides the clearest possible demonstration of the real benefits that our support for communities like ballee can deliver

8855412 fifty percent of the variance in inequality in lifetime earnings is determined by age 18 the family plays a powerful role in shaping adult outcomes that is not fully recognised by current american policies as programs are currently configured interventions early in the lives of disadvantaged children have substantially higher economic returns than later interventions such as reduced pupil teacher ratios public job training programs convict rehabilitation programs adult literacy programs tuition subsidies or expenditure on police this is because life cycle skill formation is dynamic in nature skill begets skill motivation begets motivation motivation cross fosters skill and skill cross fosters motivation if a child is not motivated to learn and engage early on in life the more likely it is that when the child becomes an adult he or she will fail in social and economic life the longer society waits to intervene in the life cycle of a disadvantaged child the more costly it is to remediate disadvantage

8855425 there is a lot of speculation going on when we are able to we will issue facts
8855426 we are not able to go into the building so we do not know what if anything is inside
8855427 until we can enter the property we do not know whether the family was inside at the time of the fire which we believe was started deliberately
8855428 once it has been deemed safe specialist search teams and forensic experts will go in
8855429 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8855430 scenes of crime officers have already carried out examinations at the various outhouses
8855431 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson

8855436 chris jill and kirstie please be safe and well my thoughts are with you all
8855437 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8855438 we believe that the department for work and pensions should support adults who become carers during their working lives to combine work and care and enable those who wish to return to paid work when caring ends or changes to do so
8855439 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8855440 dwp needs to provide adequate financial support for those who provide care when of working age either by compensating them for the extra costs of caring or if they need to give up work to care through adequate income replacement and pension protection mechanisms
8855441 we welcome the committees recognition that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and needs to be radically overhauled
8855442 the current system is enormously complicated and even dwp staff struggle to correctly identify and clearly explain the benefits that carers and their families are entitled to
8855443 it is crucial that the government takes action to boost carers incomes as a matter of urgency
8855444 if the government is serious about reaching an 80 employment rate and empowering people to work it needs to look seriously at how it can remove the barriers that make it very difficult for carers especially those on means tested benefits to engage in the labour market
8855445 we appreciate the valuable contribution carers make to their families friends neighbours and communities thats why we launched the carers strategy earlier this year
8855446 the strategy is backed up by an extra 255 million to support carers this includes 150 million over two years so that carers can take short breaks over 6 million to support young carers and up to 38 million to help them to enter or re enter the job market
8855447 we are working with employers to ensure that carers can have a better balance between their work and caring responsibilities the government is committed to reviewing the care and support system as part of the longer term welfare reform programme
8855448 we welcome this report which is a valuable contribution to the debate we will study the recommendations and respond to them in due course
8855449 this cross party report informed by expert evidence backs up what carers have been telling us
8855450 we argued for improvements to benefits as part of the governments carers strategy and were bitterly disappointed when none were included
8855451 as well as being insultingly low at just 50 55 per week carers allowance does not recognise carers individual circumstances and discourages them from combining caring with paid work
8855452 the two tier benefit recommended by the committee would be a major improvement to the current system carers need a separate benefit which recognises that they are not unemployed but are making an important contribution to society
8855453 government has promised a review of benefits but the message from carers is clear we cant wait many carers are living in poverty and rising food and fuel prices are hitting them hard
8855454 their unpaid contribution to society is worth 87 billion each year yet carers allowance is just 50 55 per week carers deserve better and need change now
8855455 the committees excellent report lays bare the extent to which carers struggle to access the support they need while carrying out one of the most valuable jobs in our society
8855456 carers save our health and social care systems billions of pounds and they deserve a better deal in return
8855457 as the committee acknowledges there is a growing funding gap in our care system and the government must not shy away from filling it
8855458 too many carers have to give up work because of their caring responsibilities
8855459 we are delighted that the committee has recognised the potential of care vouchers and we look forward to working with the government and the dwp to implement the committees recommendation
8855460 the proposals for a two tier system of benefits reflecting the need for a flexible system that suits working carers as well as those unable to work because they are dealing with intense levels of need is one that is very close to users and carers hearts our hearts and the hearts of many hundreds of benefits advice colleagues all over the country
8855461 at the very least the reports conclusions and recommendations should be at the forefront of the current thinking thats going into the green papers on both welfare reform and on social care funding for adult services
8855462 weve put additional resources some 250 million additional into short breaks for carers to ensure they get the respite needed
8855463 the carers allowance was established as a kind of thank you to carers some 30 years ago and we have recognised that it needs to be looked at
8855464 we need to look at it in terms of welfare contents for wider benefits
8855465 weve seen improvement in the support we give to carers
8855466 for some carers its about how they get support into a job how they keep contact with the labour market we have revamped some of our jobcentre plus activity to ensure that carers are now part of our mainstream delivery for support and we are working with local authorities
8855467 its a range of things that need to be done to support carers
8855468 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8855469 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8855470 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8855471 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8855472 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives
8855473 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio
8855474 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8855475 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this amp squo amp squo he told macquarie radio
8855476 beat us what team what team are you talking about
8855477 a lot of years they let me go off and play basketball
8855478 now to be able to spend time with them its awesome
8855479 i saw the fumble come out and picked up the ball i looked at the ref he looked at me and i just started running
8855480 they were driving down on us so to see a d lineman running down the field everyone got excited and picked everything up
8855481 college football is all about turnovers turnover margin is huge thats how you win and lose ballgames
8855482 its a great way to start the season offensive line did well tonight cameron threw well i thought it was where we need to be
8855483 i dont know how this gets us ready for hawaii
8855484 but were going to learn off the film and generally you improve the most from the first game to the second
8855485 it was fun to see the guys relax we messed up the locker room a little bit
8855486 we could have been known as the team with the great start and didnt make the playoffs or a team that had a great start and success afterward
8855487 our pitching has carried us the last week or two
8855488 based on the repetitive lies that the defendant has told we do not know with whom the child is or even if the child is alive
8855489 she continued to claim ignorance and at times laughed about the situation
8855490 we are determined to do everything possible to promote long term stability and fairness in the
8855491 the international credit crunch has created significant challenges not just for the uk housing market but in other parts of europe and the united states
8855492 experience in data and xml schema modeling including concepts such as namespaces restrictions extensions validation and modularity
8855493 experience in translating mapping relational data models into xml and schemas
8855494 nice to have experience utilizing xml databases oracle xml db
8855495 nice to have insurance industry experience the breakdown of time spent on job tasks is approximately xml schema amp related activities 50 xslt development maintenance etc
8855496 these cars are ideal for shopping trips and great fun to drive
8855497 we hope residents will enjoy using these cars knowing that they are doing their bit to protect the environment and at the same time avoiding the rising costs of petrol and road tax
8855498 we will continue to keep brenden ready to go we will be very smart in the way we draw up the plays for him with formations and stuff but hes ready to go he could go in right now and call our offense and get it done
8855499 i was not happy with the play of our backup quarterbacks in our last scrimmage
8855500 it appeared to me that collie might be our next best option in case max were ever to get hurt
8855501 brenden gaskins austin is not ready to play quarterback yet
8855502 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8855503 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8855504 even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8855505 your car has arrived itll be ready for pick up from the 1st september
8855506 when can you collect it i can slot you in for 9am
8855507 we need to tax it so we need the insurance documents

8855509 we do have a deal with norwich union for a 7 day drive away period we can accept their insurance over email
8855510 for 7 day drive away or an annual policy press 1
8855511 for 7 day drive away or an annual policy press 1
8855512 for 7 day drive away or an annual policy press 1 to amend a policy press 2

8855516 ah yes in order to give you the 7 day drive away i have to quote you for an annual policy
8855517 it looks to me as though theyve withheld pretty much as many documents as theyve provided
8855518 its very clear that they havent provided us with what we asked for
8855519 shes got an infection and basically shes on an antibiotic drip her spokesman said today
8855520 they are just monitoring her and she needs full rest and that is the opportunity they are giving her
8855521 ive spoken to her and shes in good spirits but she has to rest
8855522 she amp squo s got an infection and basically she amp squo s on an antibiotic drip amp squo amp squo her spokesman said today
8855523 they are just monitoring her and she needs full rest and that is the opportunity they are giving her
8855524 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8855525 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8855526 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8855527 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8855528 when we take the field on friday night nothing less than three points is going to be acceptable
8855529 to get a sense of how important this game is i talked to my team today about what its going to take to win the match i usually reserve that for the day before the match i really feel like this is a gigantic game three points is really the only acceptable result
8855530 right now they are a team below us in the standings and were trying to keep them below us
8855531 the rocky mountain cup thing is there and thats important but right now were trying to make the playoffs and winning for that reason is the main goal
8855532 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8855533 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8855534 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8855535 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8855536 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8855537 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8855538 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8855539 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8855540 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8855541 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8855542 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8855543 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8855544 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8855545 na dann brauchst du deiner freundin ja nicht mehr erz hlen du h ttest wieder kopfschmerzen
8855546 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8855547 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8855548 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8855549 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8855550 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8855551 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8855552 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8855553 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8855554 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8855555 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8855556 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8855557 the test was made on 01 21 june 2008 using windows xp professional sp2 on a p4 3200 mhz 2048mb ddram
8855558 the 246705 virus samples were chosen using vs2000 according to kaspersky f prot nod32 dr web bitdefender and mcafee antivirus programs each virus sample was unique by virus name meaning that at least 1 antivirus program detected it as a new virus
8855559 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8855560 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8855561 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8855562 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8855563 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8855564 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8855565 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8855566 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8855567 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8855568 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8855569 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8855570 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8855571 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8855572 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8855573 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8855574 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8855575 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8855576 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8855577 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8855578 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8855579 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8855580 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8855581 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8855582 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8855583 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8855584 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio
8855585 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it
8855586 shes got an infection and basically shes on an antibiotic drip her spokesman said today
8855587 they are just monitoring her and she needs full rest and that is the opportunity they are giving her
8855588 ive spoken to her and shes in good spirits but she has to rest
8855589 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8855590 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8855591 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8855592 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8855593 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives
8855594 le fait est que des citoyens am ricains se trouvaient dans la zone de conflit pendant les hostilit s il devrait tre admis quils taient l apr s avoir re u des ordres de leurs sup rieurs et le seul qui peut donner de tels ordres cest leur dirigeant
8855595 si jai bien compris cela laisse penser que quelquun aux etats unis a cr ce conflit sp cialement pour que la situation empire et pour cr er un avantage en faveur de lun des candidats
8855596 ich m chte bei der mannschaft sein es ist eine schwierige situation so lange zeit nicht mehr gegen einen ball getreten zu haben ich bin sehr traurig muss aber geduldig sein das schlimmste liegt l ngst hinter mir
8855597 wir haben die gelegenheit anderson nach seiner teilnahme an den olympischen spielen nani nach seiner sperre in der premier league und gray neville nach seiner verletzung die n tige spielpraxis zu geben
8855598 schon damals habe ich mir geschworen so etwas nie wieder zuzulassen
8855599 erkl rte der 54 j hrige der sich bisher nur auf seinen zweifachen torsch tzen milivoje novakovic verlassen konnte
8855600 die gei b cke haben bislang erst einen z hler gesammelt wir wollen ihnen von beginn an zeigen dass es auch am freitag nichts mit dem ersten saisonsieg wird
8855601 im freistaat bayern herrschen nun mal andere regeln und richtlinien
8855602 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8855603 for technical reasons we have to install receivers it cant be done by saturday
8855604 and it certainly couldnt be done in all of the iowa launch areas by saturday
8855605 we may be moving a channel or changing the lineup to make room were doing all of that as expeditiously as possible
8855606 some people will get the channel more quickly than others
8855607 it was difficult for us and difficult for mediacom im glad they kept pushing and pushing to get it done in time for opening weekend
8855608 its a great network we just had to get it fully distributed
8855609 our goal is to put it on family cable and that is where its going
8855610 i think it was pretty clear that both sides were committed to getting a deal done
8855611 we wanted to make this available and tried to make it available and were glad to get to this point
8855612 id say well over 90 percent in the eight states
8855613 the network was created to be seen by fans i think the biggest thing for now is fans will be able to see these games and see all the other programming
8855614 im very very happy with how the university has committed to me and my family
8855615 i think its a vote of confidence from gary barta and the university they are happy with the success weve had on the floor
8855616 we took into consideration that lisa has had a great tenure here
8855617 she stands for everything we believe in philosophically shes proven she can have success here
8855618 you want to reward your performers when they do a great job
8855619 the better the year the higher the performance level the greater the financial reward for the coach if someone has an elite 8 season that is something special
8855620 he looks at the success in the classroom and the type of people we recruit
8855621 i think its important when you are recruiting athletes that you are going to be leading the program the whole time
8855622 the recruits want to know and should know its important
8855623 it was very important to us but it wasnt urgent
8855624 we have traced the hard drive and are currently retrieving it the purchaser is co operating with charnwood and has stated that the data has not been distributed to any other parties
8855625 we can confirm that an individual has been arrested and is assisting the police with their inquiries
8855626 as this is now a criminal investigation the council is unable to make any further comments at this stage we have also notified the information commissioner of this incident
8855627 i regret the concern caused to charnwood residents by this serious matter we have worked vigorously to investigate the case
8855628 i am pleased that we have quickly been able to identify and track down the hard drive and deal with the situation appropriately we will give every assistance to the police in their further investigations and i will personally ensure a thorough review is also completed by the council to find out how this happened
8855629 we are redoubling our efforts to ensure that rightmove generates the enquiries from prospective home buyers which our customers so desperately need
8855630 in our view the remainder of 2008 will see estate agents leaving the industry at higher rates than in the first six months of the year as conditions continue to toughen indeed given the current low level of transactions in the market it is probable that 2009 will also see a further decrease in the number of estate agents trading
8855631 this is an exciting day for the landmark trust and for kimmeridge bay
8855632 the towers future is secure and it can now resume its role as sentinel on this stretch of coastline its familiar silhouette will continue to welcome the many thousands of people who visit and walk in kimmeridge bay each year
8855633 we at the heritage lottery fund are proud to have helped to save this iconic building for future generations to enjoy
8855634 the opening of these new homes in dereham has been the result of 19 months of dedicated work the demand for good quality affordable homes in the area is very high and these homes at dereham represent an important step towards meeting this need
8855635 the new homes have been sensitively and appropriately designed to contribute positively to the appearance of dereham as well as provide good homes at affordable rents to local people who are in housing need in the area i warmly welcome the new residents and hope they will be very happy in their new homes
8855636 there is a high demand for affordable homes in dereham and this development has made strong inroads into addressing this need
8855637 i am particularly impressed with the quality and the energy efficiency levels anticipated at these new homes as well as the care that has been taken to ensure the layout and design of the buildings are sympathetic to the area
8855638 it is hoped that new houses will provide its residents a sense of community and assist those desperately in need of affordable housing the opportunity to stay in dereham and continue to contribute positively to the area
8855639 we are determined to do everything possible to promote long term stability and fairness in the housing market
8855640 the international credit crunch has created significant challenges not just for the uk housing market but in other parts of europe and the united states
8855641 we are looking at a wide range of options to further support the housing market in the current climate working closely with industry and lenders what form that support will take will be announced in due course
8855642 we dont have the schedule out yet but the big ten is going to help us out there
8855643 one of the things we did after the season is all of us shared with the big ten that the 8 oclock game was a big challenge
8855644 we had such a great tradition of having all our basketball games on tv
8855645 it was so hard on our fans to be without it
8855646 i have confidence in myself and i think the coaches throughout the fall have gotten a lot more confident in us as specialists because last year we were kind of mediocre we had good games and we had bad games
8855647 i dont really worry about it too much because i just want to play
8855648 i think its healthy it pushes me because even last year with austin we both had a competition but we werent as accurate throughout the fall so it didnt really push us
8855649 but i think trent coming in for me at least he was pretty accurate so it pushed me continually because youve got to do the best you can you cant just have a bad day or a couple bad days because trent will stay the same
8855650 i think both of them are doing a great job out there
8855651 but for the big big picture theyve really done a good job and theyre competing well
8855652 so i think the extra points hurt me just in the publics eye
8855653 wisconsin i think was an interesting situation just because i kind of went out not knowing how to prepare for the situation
8855654 i just kind of went out and did what i knew i could do
8855655 i didnt really over think anything i just went in there and basically just kicked the ball and i think that helped me out quite a bit
8855656 ive got a little experience under my belt and i know what to expect
8855657 compared to last year i should say its night and day pretty much compared to where we were last year
8855658 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8855659 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8855660 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8855661 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8855662 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8855663 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8855664 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8855665 ive got three or four players who i wouldnt stand in their way if we get a decent offer
8855666 theres no great pressure for me to do anything on that side unless i think a good offer comes in weve got two offers on the table which dont match my valuation
8855667 we paid good money for danny higginbotham last season and if someone tells me his value has halved in that time then he wont be going anywhere
8855668 we had one or two players who could have gone out in the last week but im under no pressure to sell
8855669 we turned down one offer yesterday which was well short weve got to play hardball because every club i ring plays hardball with me you get no favours in this business
8855670 theres one or two areas where i think were stronger than others i certainly wouldnt be looking to let any of my defenders go but the strikers is an area weve got to look at
8855671 weve got quite a few in the middle of the park so there are positions where youd think if certain offers came in wed have to consider it
8855672 but if theres nothing happening in the next few days in terms of players going out it wouldnt be the end of the world but i think a lot will happen over the next 48 hours
8855673 we hope to make progress but the situation is constantly changing everyone knows were crying out for a player to fill a certain position it doesnt take a genius to work it out
8855674 id hoped to get things started at the weekend at spurs but it wasnt to be and i cant expect to walk straight into the side with such quality players around
8855675 i knew i had to take my chance when it came along and thankfully i got myself off the mark
8855676 if we draw a premier league club maybe i will get a lot more publicity back home
8855677 obviously in my home town of adelaide they keep up to date with me and hartlepool if we get a big side in the next round that would be fantastic for all of us
8855678 i dont know any of the aussies in the premier league i would love to come up against newcastle and mark viduka because when i was growing up he was one of best players in australia and someone i looked up to
8855679 he has had a fantastic career both for clubs and country
8855680 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8855681 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8855682 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8855683 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8855684 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8855685 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8855686 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
8855687 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time
8855688 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
8855689 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now
8855690 was released at the end of june 2005 and featured remixes from jj flores and peter bailey
8855691 you make me want to be a man bloodshy amp avant mix

8855696 pleased to see that jean lambert has specifically addressed the need for increased responsibility sharing amongst the 27 eu member countries indeed ms lambert has seen for herself the problems facing our country on her various visits to malta and her first hand experience is being translated into concrete suggestions in her report
8855697 we look forward to a positive vote on this report next week in strasbourg responsibility should be shared equitably between all eu states
8855698 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
8855699 wed wanted him for a while and at first we were told he wasnt available for loan but we kept asking the question and eventually were told he was available
8855700 we felt we needed a physical presence and we dont know when pawel abbott is going to be fit and proudlocks not a real physical presence like tommy wright was
8855701 dont get me wrong i still want us to pass the ball since tommys gone we have passed the ball along the deck a lot more and i want to continue that but liam should give us a threat in the air and he can play too
8855702 with all these crosses that we have had going into the box we have needed someone there and liams 6ft 3 and fantastic in the air
8855703 weve not had that option in the air of being able to flick on goal kicks and when weve put a lot of balls into the penalty area but havent converted our chances
8855704 the loans give us time to get other strikers fit plus it means we do not have to use curtis main too much just yet because that would do him more harm than good
8855705 but he is staying involved in training and getting better in time and the same goes for michael smith
8855706 it depends on the player how he reacts to not being in the side but youve got stiff competition for places at every big club especially up front and its no different here
8855707 id love mido to stay because hes a quality player and hes shown that by scoring three goals already this season we need players like him at the club and id be disappointed if he left but its his decision and also the managers
8855708 its time he had a more stable period in his career and was at a club for a bit longer
8855709 its a different position for me but i did play there for arsenal and i need to learn the defensive side of the game im learning with every match and if the manager wants to play me out wide ive got no problems with that
8855710 were good enough to finish in the top 10 its a long season and you can get hit by injuries but after the start weve had were looking to finish top 10
8855711 weve started this season much better than last year weve hit the ground running and its important to do that to get as many points on the board as possible to get confidence high
8855712 fitness wise as the leg goes i dont feel any pain in it ive been training now for about a week and hopefully get out there on sunday and try my best
8855713 you could say ive trained at this place a few times before
8855714 i think someone winning the olympic games at a distance that you have jumped before all be it no jumps or behind the board is a fair bit of inspiration for me
8855715 but at the same time to watch an olympic games won with a distance of 8 34 and to see people winning championships that youve beaten many times before is slightly frustrating in another way its encouraging that it at least shows ive got the potential and if my body was to hold up for once i could do something special
8855716 ive had a lot of weeks of just training there wasnt really the opportunity to race out there so sunday will be the first time to race in a few weeks so hopefully it should all go well
8855717 christine will be going for it she always does so well see
8855718 planning for 2012 i just need to sit down with my coach plan our four year cycle take it year by year
8855719 there are different major competitions in the four years leading up to 2012 so just take it bit by bit and try and improve on the training as we go along
8855720 gateshead is a good track its my home track so its nice to come and perform in front of a home crowd adult tickets start from just 12 tickets will be available for purchase on the gates from 12 30pm with the first event beginning at 2pm
8855721 in his nearly four years as president of the newspaper association and the print media association trevor had played a major part in settling the associations into a new structure and ensuring that they functioned professionally within the strategies that had been set for them
8855722 we just believe in ourselves this year we beat lone peak 1 0 and last year we lost 1 0 we lost to american fork 2 0 last year and beat them this year 1 0 our girls want it and we believe in ourselves we have that much more experience
8855723 looking really good at times and shaky at times but theyre looking good more of the time
8855724 its been a long summer but a short summer things have gone fast for me but im excited about this season so im ready to get it going
8855725 its been a fun ride i just want to get caught up on my sleep right now and then ill be a lot happier have a little more chance to reflect
8855726 i think most of the guys that were on this team want him back
8855727 it was just amazing that that could be man made
8855728 we will continue to keep brenden ready to go we will be very smart in the way we draw up the plays for him with formations and stuff but hes ready to go he could go in right now and call our offense and get it done
8855729 i was not happy with the play of our backup quarterbacks in our last scrimmage
8855730 it appeared to me that collie might be our next best option in case max were ever to get hurt
8855731 brenden gaskins austin is not ready to play quarterback yet

8855744 my wife discovered this loophole as well i just recently called my local costco and asked if i could cash out my cash card and to my surprise she said i could all i have to do is get a supervisor to do it for me after hearing this i went online and ordered two 600 gift cards the limit is 1k per card and i dont think there is a limit to how many which well both use for costco gas and food my plan is to see how easy it is to cash out and if it proves to not be a problem i am going to purchase an additional 2k worth of cards per month cash out redeposit into my banking account and get those air miles from my mortgage payment im sure that would interest you it sounds to good to be true well see
8855745 i dont think a manager would let you cash out 2k gift cards especially on a regular basis good luck with that plus the value of a 100 in miles is about 1 i dont think id want to chance buying 2000 worth of costco credit and then not be able to cash it out simply for a 20 return

8855747 i believe that the super cup is now considered as a five star event in monaco
8855748 it gives monaco an economic boost as well as all of the nearby communes
8855749 prince rainier iii wanted to stage this match because it makes monaco known throughout the entire world
8855750 the organisation of the next super cup match starts the moment that the previous match finishes
8855751 gradually meetings take place with the various government services and the work accelerates from may
8855752 monaco is a city where safety and security is very important and people come to the stadium with pleasure because the spectator can sit down with his children knowing that there will be no problems in the stands
8855753 the grand prix has helped us enormously as far as football is concerned
8855754 the super cup is the organisation of the grand prix on a reduced scale in terms of welcoming and accommodating people and security aspects and we know that these have to be at the highest level
8855755 super cup matches permit me to see things that i cant see in a championship match
8855756 thank you im not as good a speaker as my opponent but i was a p o w so suck on that
8855757 in the light of continuing weakness in the housing market and the wider economy we continue to expect arrears and repossessions to increase for the remainder of the year although we will be putting further resources into tackling the problem
8855758 in terms of lending the main area of focus remains buy to let where tenant demand remains strong and rents are rising however we plan to reduce mortgage volumes in the second half and into 2009 until more favourable economic conditions return
8855759 first of all we have to progress from the group stage and to do that you need 10 points to qualify
8855760 the tournament really kicks off in february that is when it gets exciting the one off knock out stages
8855761 i think we have a squad to challenge the best but you cannot think of yourselves as favourites when you see teams like ac milan barcelona and juventus all great names
8855762 we will make sure we apply ourselves in the right way then we will have a chance
8855763 standard liege were a surprise to me because belgian football has not been that great for some years now but it was an excellent performance against liverpool
8855764 i am delighted for our fans we have once again drawn the champions of europe last season it was ac milan the year before it was barcelona
8855765 if we are going to play in europe and we are very proud to be scotlands representatives we may as well start with the big ones
8855766 they dont come much bigger than manchester united so we are delighted

8855775 dat starttarief was om de kosten te dekken van technische handelingen die het netwerk moet doen om je te kunnen laten bellen zoals het zoeken van de andere beller en het verbinden van de twee telefoons in plaats van dat starttarief brengen providers nu altijd de eerste minuut volledig in rekening

8855787 we are determined to do everything possible to promote long term stability and fairness in the housing market
8855788 the international credit crunch has created significant challenges not just for the uk housing market but in other parts of europe and the united states
8855789 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8855790 we believe that the department for work and pensions should support adults who become carers during their working lives to combine work and care and enable those who wish to return to paid work when caring ends or changes to do so
8855791 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8855792 we are taking these steps because we want to reinforce the tremendous importance of workouts and reward their use
8855793 giving our servicers more time and greater compensation to help troubled borrowers is fundamental to preserving homeownership and maximizing our efforts to minimize foreclosures
8855794 one of our best wholesalers had been bugging us youve got to make a pumpkin beer
8855795 i was just scratching my head it wont last i thought the wholesaler was just jumping onto a trend
8855796 its developed a following all its own and you have to say its on merit not just for kicks
8855797 the essential reference of domestic brewers and their bottled brands
8855798 tell me what is more american than pumpkin at thanksgiving
8855799 at this time of year there are really only two major styles competing for seasonal popularity and between the oktoberfest beers and the pumpkin flavored brands i think pumpkin beer wins hands down for uniqueness and flavor
8855800 brewers can practice a ton of creativity when it comes to the pumpkin beer style some pumpkin ales purely rely on natural pumpkin flavors while others are highly spiced and take on the pure delight of liquid pumpkin pie
8855801 the amount of exuberance that pumpkin beer gets its just unbelievable
8855802 its not just a fad people honestly cant wait for pumpkin beer

8855804 turretinfan hopes to create the impression in the minds of his audience that the catholic church teaches that islam is salvific
8855805 contention that tfs questions are based on a false premise
8855806 those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the gospel of christ or his church yet sincerely seek god and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do his will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience
8855807 those who in shadows and images seek the unknown god
8855808 they claim to profess a belief in the god of abraham
8855809 a step closer to accepting the fullness of his gospel even if there is much error in what a muslim may otherwise believe
8855810 if we accept that muslims do in fact believe in the god of abraham then such a belief would make them more receptive to accepting the gospel of jesus christ and thus be saved
8855811 it would be contrary to the faith to consider the church as one way of salvation alongside those constituted by the other religions seen as complementary to the church or substantially equivalent to her
8855812 converging with the church toward the eschatological kingdom of god
8855813 if it is true that the followers of other religions can receive divine grace it is also certain that objectively speaking they are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those who in the church have the fullness of the means of salvation
8855814 the catholic church does not believe that a person can be saved through adherence to islam
8855815 catholic church does not believe that a persona can be saved by adherence to
8855816 all the children of the church should nevertheless remember that their exalted condition results not from their own merits but from the grace of christ if they fail to respond in thought word and deed to that grace not only shall they not be saved but they shall be more severely judged
8855817 i believe that all roads lead to the same place
8855818 turretinfan hopes to create the impression in the minds of his audience that the catholic church teaches that islam is salvific
8855819 i dont think that god exists but if i was shown convincing reasons to believe that he does then i would go and get baptized immediately and become one of his devout followers
8855820 even if there is a god ill still refuse to believe in him and ill spit in his face when i die

8855840 i really like the pizza they always have at the cfug meetings

8855842 oop is the future of cf unless want it to stay in the limited run limited traffic site category
8855843 but a database enabled website is not a web application

8855848 oo has the potential to be more sustainable in the enterprise lends itself to standards compliance oo standards until weve compiled cf standards and to give cf a wider venue i would prefer to inherit an oo app over a pp app oo can give cf a deeper acceptance and penetration into markets that previously only accepted java and net there will always be a place for pp even if its supporting legacy apps but oo is the key to opening more doors
8855849 with such an array of financial products to choose from it can be tempting to turn to a price comparison site to do the legwork for you
8855850 you need to use two or three comparison sites and check directly with providers to get the best quote and remember that cheapest isnt always best its a false economy if you dont get enough cover for your needs or have to pay a huge excess if you claim

8855854 jadi usaha arifin untuk menyeret amerika intervensi ke dalam hubungan belanda dengan aceh sudah dimulai sebelum panglima tibang tiba di singapura
8855855 untuk memastikan isi perjanjian itu muhammad arifin telah membuatnya begitu katanya dalam bentuk perjanjian yang pernah dibuat antara beberapa negara dengan siam rancangan yang dibacakan sendiri oleh muhammad arifin kepada studer tetapi studer kurang setuju dengan rancangan perjanjian tersebut ia mengambil sebuah buku kemudian membaca teks perjanjian brunei dalam bahasa inggris yang diterjemahkan ke dalam bahasa melayu oleh seorang kerani konsulat sedangkan arifin menulisnya
8855856 intrik intrik yang sangat serius antara perutusan aceh dan konsul amerika di singapura terungkap hal ini memerlukan pertimbangan langsung perincian dikirim dengan kapal yang pertama
8855857 perutusan menyampaikan kepada konsul italia dan amerika surat sultan aceh yang meminta bantuan unruk menghadapi belanda konsul amerika berjanji akan menyurati laksamana jenkins di cina dan telah menyusun sebuah perjanjian 12 pasal yang akan ditandatangani oleh sultan dan akan mengirimkan kembali orang orang amerika siap sedia datang dalam waktu dua bulan informasi ini kiranya mendapat kepercayaan sepenuhnya
8855858 jika anda tidak merasa bimbang terhadap kebenaran informasi konsul singapura kirimkan angkatan laut yang kuat ke aceh untuk meminta penjelasan dan pertanggungjawaban atas sikap bermuka dua dan khianat itu
8855859 selama kedaulatan kita tidak diakui tetap ada campur tangan asing yang mengancam kita seperti pedang democles
8855860 dewan hindia di batavia yang saya pimpin dengan dihadiri oleh jenderal dan laksamana menyetujui usul saya untuk mengirim secepat mungkin komisi yang didukung oleh empat batalyon ke aceh untuk menyampaikan ultimatum adakala pengakuan kedaulatan adakala perang kita akan hadapi amerika dengan fait accompli presiden nienwenhuijzen adalah orangnya
8855861 jika orang orang belanda datang menyerang aceh hendaklah semua orang aceh serentak menyerang dan menghancurkannya
8855862 dan sumber yang sangat dipercaya diterima kabar bahwa armada amerika di hongkong dipastikan telah menerima perintah untuk berlayar ke aceh sebelum kita berada di sana
8855863 mengucapkan terima kasih atas khidmamya yang baik terhadap belanda terutama yang dialami dalam peristiwa peristiwa yang terjadi pada masa yang akhir di kepulauan hindia
8855864 pemerintah belanda menginginkan supaya dikawatkan kepada konsulat amerika di singapura agar tidak campur tangan dalam masalah masalah sumatra
8855865 pemerintah amerika tidak mempunyai bukti bahwa konsul di singapura campur tangan oleh karena tidak memperoleh bukti yang nyata tidak mungkin menganggap dia telah melakukan hal hal di luar yang ditugaskan jika pemerintah belanda mengajukan pengaduan hal itu dengan sepenuhnya akan dipertimbangkan dan kepada konsul kami akan dikirimkan instruksi sesuai dengan kewajiban yang dituntut dan kami terhadap sesuatu negara sahabat
8855866 pemerintah belanda menyatakan adanya campur tangan anda dalam urusan urusannya di sumatra hentikan kalau ada dan laporkan kejadian yang sebenarnya
8855867 kita harap kita tidak ingin melarang anda mengadakan perundingan akan tetapi pertimbangan bahwa pengakuan kedaulatan atau perang sebagai tuntutan akan menimbulkan pengaruh di mana mana
8855868 diperkirakan tidak akan ada jaminan keamanan tanpa pengakuan kedaulatan dengan tidak adanya pengakuan kedaulatan pengiriman ekspedisi tidak ada faedahnya mengharapkan segera perintah yang positif atau biarkan saya memutuskan sendiri persoalan ini atas tanggung jawab saya sendiri
8855869 tidak berkeberatan apabila pengakuan kedaulatan merupakan hasil dan perundingan akan tetapi saya tidak membenarkan pengakuan kedaulatan merupakan tuntutan

8855886 what is e commerce and how it can triple your profit fast
8855887 we have long seen hips as not fit for purpose and as the wrong answer to simplifying the house buying process quite simply the government tried to force square pegs into round holes and the slower property market is making this situation worse
8855888 for instance the current call for local searches to be conducted as part of a hip is madness due to the length of time properties are on the market in the current climate a majority of searches are now out of date by the time the property is sold which means they have to be repeated at extra cost to the consumer
8855889 not all banks have been affected by the global credit crunch in the same way among the uk banks those with less exposure to the us and uk housing markets and greater exposure to asia have fared relatively well the key areas to monitor now are the strength of banks capital and liquidity positions as well as their exposure to commercial property and specialist mortgage markets where prices may weaken further
8855890 when conditions eventually stabilise banking stocks are likely to experience a sharp bounce but it may be short lived tough fundamentals such as a relative lack of growth options pressure on margins from increased competition and still stretched capital positions will soon reassert themselves

8855904 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8855905 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed

8855911 if you take money out of the companies and they have to find it somewhere else then their investment costs will go up and customers will have to bear the brunt of that there is a serious risk that bills would go up
8855912 last year we made just a whisker under 500million in the uk that doesnt buy even one new power station
8855913 it is our plan to spend more money than we earn in the uk for the next ten years that is a big commitment and if there was a windfall tax that is the sort of commitment that would have to be re evaluated

8855917 i was working in a job that wasnt very fulfilling and i was very stressed until i came across some meditation and therapy cds after that i was hooked
8855918 i did some research on sound therapy and found music by jonathan goldman
8855919 he uses sound frequencies that allow the listener to actually de stress i listened to those and found that sound therapy was a very powerful tool to help one shake off some of that unwanted stress that tends to accumulate
8855920 i went seeking those cds called a few distribution companies and i ended up opening up a webstore in which i carry all types of relaxation music

8855950 the catalyzer brought it under the allowable level which is 5g km
8855951 prior to that regulation a typical two stroke could be 10 times that
8855952 just as the emissions regulations of 1997 were the end of conventional larger displacement two strokes
8855953 that is going to be a very very tough row to hoe
8855954 the cleanest motorcycle engine is far dirtier than the dirtiest car
8855955 if we were to force the same levels of emissions onto scooters as are on automobiles theyd be bigger heavier and more expensive by a fair bit
8855956 all our standards are in line with the epa which are recognized as being the most stringent national standards in the world for on road vehicles
8855957 we looked at it but testing was going to be so horrendously expensive to try to capture all the different varieties available and find environmental standards for them
8855958 it would be quite expensive for vehicles that are driven four months a year and usually just on weekends
8855959 we didnt think that by introducing this program we were going to sell a whole bunch more bikes
8855960 we wanted to highlight the fact that driving a vespa is a good thing to do

8855974 ultimately we developed this to help you get through the weekend its a tool to help you have a better experience of the festival
8855975 a lot of what we hear is that with so much to do and see at festivals such as electric picnic the challenge is to figure out whats going on where to go next and what time your favourite bands are playing at
8855976 were also sending out the o2 electricnav via bluetooth so non o2 customers can avail of this for free in the nokia bluetooth zone
8855977 mobile technology fits in with the way the festival model has evolved over the past few years the old model involved large groups of people heading to see one or two bands the slane type model
8855978 now youre seeing more complex diverse festivals such as electric picnic and oxegen where the lists of artists and things to do and see is mind blowing
8855979 with this o2 has a great opportunity to help people make the most of the modern festival experience
8855980 people are more likely to be there without their wallet than their mobile phone
8855981 youre talking about a tech savvy crowd that is more than happy to use the mobile phone to its full potential
8855982 imtv is bringing two camera crews to capture the sights and sounds of electric picnic and we will be using our twitter account to keep festival goers up to date and to be able to interact with other twitter attendees about their experiences
8855983 were aiming to spread the electric picnic experience across as much online media as possible wed like to qik live interviews over the web as well as publish links straight onto twitter

8855995 the boys were terrific to go down and beat peel last week we blew them off the park in the third quarter and the way we were moving the footy and with our forwards being dangerous was really exciting
8855996 our back line was outstanding again kyle hardingham gave us plenty of run andrew macpherson didnt give hayden ballantyne a sniff and we got on top through the middle and aaron monk calib mourish andrew mccarrey and anthony kyanga who were dangerous up forward
8855997 we can only control what we can and its a must win game against west perth obviously then we hope peel can knock off swans at bassendean which is a possibility but our only focus is on trying to beat west perth
8855998 its a huge challenge up there they are a quality side and they also have a lot to play for its a big challenge for our young group but i know they are looking forward to it there were no expectations at the start of the year and we have continued to get better throughout our slow start could still come back to bite us but the way weve played in the second half of the year has been terrific

8856022 one more step to create a habit is preparation with preparation making your habit stick is easier e g set your alarm clock if you want to get up early the more preparation the better move the alarm clock across the room so you cant easily hit snooze prepare your clothes so you dont need to think about it as you sleep walk through your morning go to bed early to make it easier to get up know your morning routine in advance so you dont have to think about it when youre tired

8856025 productivity inclined is a preference for hyper productivity squeezing in as much as you possibly can within a 24 hour period with an extremely full schedule and tight routine on the other hand simplicity inclined is a preference for achieving goals and happiness by paring your life down to the essentials and actually have less items on your to do list but with more focus
8856026 with all due respect i fear i fundamentally disagree with you i would be tempted to argue productivity and simplicity should perhaps not be seen as alternatives but deserve to be combined into what can be termed effectiveness

8856029 nebraska should have a fairly easy time with western michigan the opening game with a new coach they will want to make a statement however western michigan brings back a number of starters with an excellent defense husker quarterback joe ganz should have a big game p s smash mouth football is back
8856030 western michigan comes into lincoln with a recent track record of knocking off the big boys on their home turf
8856031 on the flip side nebraska has the potential to place a world class offense on the field and the defense should be drastically improved over the product weve witnessed the last couple of seasons given a relative lack of depth talent does exist in lincoln just not in the numbers we expected under coach osborne expect nu head coach bo pelini to play fairly conservative early on and to substitute younger less experienced players often i think hell try to get basics established please read this as running the football aggressively and will show a more aggressive pass rush as well look for a very solid win but not a blowout
8856032 one would think we could bully around this team from the mid america conference
8856033 we believe our offense will click right away or at least after a quarter ganz will be great this year the o line should be alright and we have some great running backs we want to see smash mouth football
8856034 the defense is a huge unknown it will take some time to instill the culture and physicality that embodies what the blackshirts are all about western michigan returns 20 starters including cornerback londen fryar son of nu legend irving fryar and eight on offense that being said we believe the excitement of the new era will be too much for western michigan and our guys will play inspired ball
8856035 thats the beauty of it physicians can sit at home on the weekend and earn these credits

8856044 financially it helps because i cant get insurance to save my life now with my diagnosis
8856045 with the muscular dystrophy clinic a large number of the cases we see involve relatively rare conditions

8856048 the physical therapist teaches me about exercises i can do to keep from deteriorating

8856086 die exaa will eine br ckenfunktion bernehmen da wir einerseits im westeurop ischen strommarkt gut verankert sind und unsere liquidit t durch zusammenschalten der m rkte unseren zum teil nicht so liquiden nachbarl ndern zur stimulierung ihres marktes zur verf gung stellen k nnen
8856087 der echte konkurrent der stromb rsen ist der otc markt
8856088 dadurch wird sich mittelfristig ein europ isches netzwerk an stromhandelspl tzen etablieren das einen sicheren und transparenten stromhandel in europa gew hrleistet das bringt den vorteil dass dieses netz an stromhandelspl tzen den wettbewerb bei der erbringung der dienstleistung sicherstellt was den markt belebt die qualit t sichert und ein preismonopol verhindert

8856090 i would have much prefered an ice based secondary to the cryocopter rather than some out of place debuff
8856091 the itunes business model works brings in money for us too but we lack price differential control apple wont let us we hate that
8856092 it might be that all it takes is a few good men to do nothing for evil to flourish but it only takes one or two good men to take things too far for injustice to flourish
8856093 this is the same system we have in place today
8856094 the only difference is that we will now provide a limit by which a customer may be contacted
8856095 an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis

8856101 since the employees and contract labourers had left the plant late last night so it was a conscious decision of the company that there would be no attendance at the project site at any of the three shifts today
8856102 we will not allow anyone to enter tatas plant on friday
8856103 based on the evidence available to me i do not believe any of the detainees were beaten up stripped naked or mistreated by the australian fe force element on april 29 30 2008
8856104 a strong sense of cultural appropriateness underpins the initial allegations as some ana soldiers at the fob forward operating base objected to infidels handling muslims and did not believe an old man and a cripple could be taliban
8856105 the accommodations used for the prisoners at the fob which had previously been used for dogs may have also increased their anger
8856106 the economic structure has been optimized the governments working efficiency had been raised and peoples living standards have improved
8856107 is one of the highlights of the hu administration that government is becoming more and more transparent and open
8856108 years ago you could never imagine such a big amount of embezzled money would be audited and then publicized
8856109 china is now in the process of reform both economically and politically
8856110 although it is painful or even cruel for some government agencies and officials it must be that way it is the cost we have to pay for reform and development
8856111 were always looking for the right developers the right location and the right product templar development fits our model
8856112 as the buzz around this new brand continues to grow were looking forward to opening our doors here in cranberry and showing off the great amenities this brand has to offer
8856113 cambria suites was designed for travelers who want to take their lifestyle with them when they travel and its exactly the kind of new innovative hotel brand thats perfect for a place like cranberry township
8856114 were excited to build this contemporary new hotel that appeals to both business and leisure travelers in such a great market
8856115 were excited to work with template development in building this new upscale lifestyle hotel brand throughout the pennsylvania region were currently in discussions with templar about several other key opportunities in the region
8856116 this offer represents the best package of pay and benefits in the aerospace industry
8856117 at the same time its a contract offer that allows our company to meet its commitments to customers and sustain our success into the future
8856118 we believe these contracting changes along with other modifications help to clear up those possible misperceptions
8856119 have helped fuel excessive and dangerous off label use of aranesp
8856120 i will say this though due to the fact that real time strategy games are real time there is always an advantage to being a faster player and i think people should take that into consideration what im saying is if you like slow strategy games you might want to play turn based games instead since that removes the real time factor and then it wont matter who the faster player is and it will be more dependent on either luck or the strategy you picked

8856122 the recovery of such a major haul of weapons is a success not just for the force but for the people of manchester as we have stopped these guns from getting onto the streets and into the hands of people who would use them
8856123 we see somebody down and out we care for them
8856124 to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than their self interest
8856125 it is now up to the new head of the board to decide on our recommendations
8856126 in any case asif has already been suspended from all forms of cricket because of his positive dope test in the indian premier league
8856127 hes a faithful servant in the truest sense of the word
8856128 one of the most important decisions i will make as governor
8856129 we believe we have the key growth drivers in place to build upon our solid financial footing
8856130 the community is the primary beneficiary because any gain from operations is invested back into the medical center
8856131 not only is cvph medical center the largest employer in the region but the quality of health care it provides in this region is crucial to the quality of life and crucial to the economic development of the region
8856132 weve been identifying medical reimbursements to cvph as a top medical issue for at least three years
8856133 our message has always been to find a way to make medicare reimbursement rates fair
8856134 he chose to retire because he wasnt up to his full capacity
8856135 i was told it was because of his back and his health problems
8856136 i think thats their story and theyre sticking to it
8856137 hasnt been paying as much attention as he could have been
8856138 ive noticed a trend when they retire all of a sudden
8856139 in my opinion its maryellen and her staff and with jack
8856140 blaming it on transportation department head john franklin would be so unfair he was given the tools he was given and the staff he had
8856141 they seem to have a handle on it and people are getting through i heard that today for the first time
8856142 there has to be accountability for what happened we just cant have this its just been nightmarish for everybody concerned
8856143 all im asking for is someone to respond and call me back
8856144 he has a hard enough time with school without being on the bus for two hours
8856145 she needs to know how much parents have had to spend
8856146 its the frustration of it all you cant really put a price on frustration its put a hardship on a lot of people
8856147 this is being treated as arson and until we can determine whether the family was inside it will remain arson
8856148 this will allow them to have better communication with the rest of the system
8856149 we want to get everyone playing on the same field
8856150 weve been struggling with controlling speed limits along that stretch ever since inter faith care center opened its doors across the street from the pine view apartments
8856151 when i see something like that i automatically slow down
8856152 i see many of them hit their brakes lights as soon as they see the readout
8856153 i think its especially effective with those who truly want to obey the posted speed limit and just need a reminder i just wish we could have one in the other direction as well because when some drivers see the 50 mile per hour traffic sign on the edge of town they automatically start to speed up
8856154 he is more than any other contemporary political figure a creature of these times
8856155 this is a person who could help him manage the pressures of the life he thought he wanted
8856156 i didnt think of him as someone to send out on mechanical tasks of digging out all the cases
8856157 he is able to use his disciplined mind to not get caught up in the emotional swirl
8856158 he was almost upset at how thin skinned i was
8856159 i get the sense that hes participating in these things but also watching them
8856160 i have to get better and i will do better
8856161 thats where the high minded and big thinking barack came in
8856162 his initial instincts were off from where regular peoples were
8856163 he was an outsider but within the ultimate insider clubs
8856164 all the time he says lets keep in mind that this is not about barack obama
8856165 you need to accept that role to a degree if youre the nominee or the president
8856166 when i started walking down the convention hall i felt the spirit
8856167 i dont know what im going to do when obama gives his speech i guess im going to yell and holler
8856168 they didnt want to take a day off from work even black folks nobody believed i was going to be able to do it
8856169 every time the landlord put somebody out in the community we put them back in
8856170 i saw kids throwing rocks at cars i was angry at what was happening and i was hurt because i saw those little children being exposed to all that violence
8856171 to come here now and see a young black man who at one time couldnt even look at a white woman couldnt walk in the front door couldnt eat in the same restaurant to see obama be nominated as president
8856172 we cant seem to stop students from getting loaded so we want to stop even having to try
8856173 while tata elxsi would leverage on fujitsus brand equity technology leadership we would gain from their presence and experience in the automotive aerospace defence education amp research media amp entertainment and manufacturing verticals i am confident that this collaboration will create a high and positive business growth and customer satisfaction
8856174 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8856175 if the democrats dont get over this they will never look themselves in the mirror and say oh me oh my why isnt our party landsliding the worst republicans in the history of the republican party
8856176 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8856177 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8856178 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8856179 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8856180 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8856181 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8856182 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8856183 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8856184 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8856185 chuck the ipod once in a while stop listening to non stop music which is blowing out your mind and get serious
8856186 read the grim lesson of history here and abroad when people do not turn on to politics politics will turn on them

8856188 the community sets you up for playing here youve got tennis and basketball and swimming and meeting people and getting on the leagues the association has events every three months that the whole community attends it just lends itself to getting to know your neighbors and hanging out in your own community versus going elsewhere for entertainment
8856189 we want folks to come in and live here and feel like theyve actually gone to a resort for the weekend
8856190 you can go to work knowing that your kids dont have to stay inside all day and can go out and enjoy themselves
8856191 its a little unusual in oklahoma city where else can you buy a house in the 130 000s and have a clubhouse and pool in a gated community
8856192 families with children are more interested in having a safe place for their children to play
8856193 i just want to be charged a fair price just like the person next to me probably is

8856241 we were running around replacing cables instead of doing much needed maintenance not to mention the fact that large parts of the city were without power until we could replace the cables
8856242 this meant a copper cable thief had a 96 chance of getting away with his crime
8856243 the first time we nabbed him we tracked him down in intensive care where he spent two months after being shocked while trying to steal copper cables he has received so many shocks that his hands are completely disfigured
8856244 we believe the name alone must already strike fear in the hearts of criminals
8856245 weve arrested 30 council officials and nine contractors over the last 12 months
8856246 i also work with the media highlighting our successes which provides us with positive feedback and the support of the community
8856247 thieves will come during the night digging a pilot hole to determine the thickness and direction of the cable
8856248 the next night they will return to dig up the cable
8856249 from here on the cable is typically dragged into the bushes where it is stripped for the copper inside this process includes an attempt to remove all identifying marks
8856250 we have 3 500 bucket shops in the western cape where people literally sleep on the copper
8856251 cape town exported r77 million of copper last year and we dont have a single copper mine
8856252 you dont have to be a genius to figure out where this comes from
8856253 it is difficult to ascribe a specific number to theft
8856254 in the scrap trade there are large cartels at work
8856255 the export market and the associated processes have not been a focus of the nfccc resulting in an attempt to treat the symptoms of the crime and a failure to address the core of the problem
8856256 this is clear in the escalating numbers of incidents in recent years
8856257 if the number of thefts is to be reduced the market into which the stolen cable is disposed must be addressed and more effective response mechanisms from both government and business need to be put in place
8856258 this is seen as a major achievement as it would instil the governance structure at the level where it is required and specifically obtain the required buy in and cooperation from the south africa police service and other law enforcement organisations that have not been available in the past

8856270 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8856271 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels
8856272 and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
8856273 the united states is now more dependent on foreign oil than it ever was

8856289 and our plans are already in motion to secure a survey facility data analysis bureau and publishers for next year
8856290 its none of their business what my family income is and how many children i wish to have
8856291 all middle eastern gaming policy information and demographic data gathered in this survey is 100 completely anonymous we ask for no personal identification or names
8856292 we took a risk being the lead firm in this project
8856293 but preliminary results suggest it was the right thing to do and the fact that we will get the results first puts us miles ahead of the competition
8856294 im very intrigued by this middle eastern gaming policy study
8856295 i swore i would never take part in big business but the ramifications of this project do benefit higher education and the community at large
8856296 middle eastern gaming policy survey results have always been difficult to gauge
8856297 but we consulted many unaffiliated survey groups institutions of higher learning and professional demographic firms about how to create a quality middle eastern gaming policy survey that would produce great results
8856298 well have a fantastic array of fresh information to use
8856299 i cant thank marylou manecke enough for putting together such an organized event its one thing to come up with an idea but another to follow through with it and take care of all the logistical problems it presents

8856322 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners

8856329 i dont want to go into detail as to what we do because what we do is really predicated on when its supposed to arrive
8856330 klein had been moving in and i hoped to trap him in a big pot
8856331 while it was possible steve had a big pair i knew he was an advanced player and it was possible he was trying to pick up the pot with a squeeze play
8856332 leading out here would have likely caused steve to fold overcards but if he had a real hand hed probably raise and put me in a tough spot
8856333 a check raise would be a much scarier scenario for steve so i decided to go for it
8856334 the way the hand came down pre flop i figured he had to know this flop was right in my wheelhouse
8856335 my flat calling both kleins raise and steves re raise cried out middle pair or middle connectors i knew he couldnt call my all in with overcards and that there was a decent chance hed suspect a set and lay down a strong hand like an overpair i call this the threat of the set
8856336 when a player makes a big move against a players strong pre flop raise his opponent must consider that hes up against a set it can be a good bluffing opportunity
8856337 i dont know im not a bat maker and im not a termite so i cant tell you whats good wood and whats bad wood
8856338 im happy to see manny i respect him in my career barry bonds and ramirez have been the two best of my time
8856339 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength
8856340 i asked them if i dont get a call then what should i do
8856341 it doesnt matter im just going out there and if i can show the eagles something thats good if not hopefully one of those 31 other teams are looking sure i want to be a part of this nobody wants to start over but if i have to go i still want to make a living i have a family to take care of
8856342 ill take my butt back to college and finish up my last semester then try again next year i have a semester left for a communications degree
8856343 you never know exactly whats going on or what theyre thinking
8856344 ive been there myself all you can do is control what you control play hard and let it fall where it may
8856345 it was a bad time you have anger disappointment and uncertainty about whats going to happen
8856346 the hardest part is accepting it and the uncertainty of what youre going to do next
8856347 its really not about cutting its about waiting for that next call
8856348 anyone who has played in the last six ryder cups has experienced getting their butt beat so i mean im not looking for experience im going to pick players that are playing well and that are very confident
8856349 i really want to play on the team but thinking about it would get in my way
8856350 if i just focus on what gets me to play well it will help me get on the team and if i do get on the team it will help me play well in the ryder cup
8856351 they have some talented and dangerous people in their backfield
8856352 he has a very good arm great feet he makes things happen
8856353 burying the 2008 yankees has become too darn easy like practicing layups on an eight foot rim or beating a 4 year old at checkers
8856354 if you are a yankee in 2008 the red sox are your daddy
8856355 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8856356 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8856357 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8856358 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8856359 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8856360 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8856361 the first day i got back i went into my local bagel shop later identified as delrans bagel cafe and they treated me to a free breakfast
8856362 later on that day i went to the medport diner in medford and they gave me a free lunch its been cool you can tell its really been exciting for everybody some people more than others
8856363 people here are just so happy for her that for us it really is the least we can do
8856364 for many of us it was like watching your own daughter everyone in the community has just been so touched by what she has done
8856365 its been nice to be home and relax but i never get tired of training
8856366 it was great to go out with a bang at the olympics but i know i have to get better every day so im ready to get started
8856367 playing good football i would even take it to the first couple of weeks in camp where he struggled with a couple of things worked through that and came out in a positive way
8856368 kevin is ready to play and a j has already proven he can play thats a real positive thing right now i have no problem putting kevin in a game right now hell do a good job
8856369 although its just the preseason and the starters werent there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8856370 the biggest thing now is to not regress ive gotten progressively better i just cant regress when im sitting on the sidelines i have to make sure i get plenty of reps in practice and keep my part
8856371 the group we have out there right now i really like
8856372 i dont know if its the twos or what it is but it seemed like everyone we had in there had great continuity everyone works hard and thats all you can ask of those guys
8856373 there are a couple of things there that we are working on and i think weve got that nailed down
8856374 i think he has a chance to be a pretty good quarterback so well see how he keeps progressing
8856375 hes been through a full year and going into your second year most players are a little bit more comfortable with the system he can anticipate the upcoming events a little bit better
8856376 absolutely spent was i thinking about leaving him in i definitely had a thought about it but i knew there definitely was no sense in sending him back out
8856377 this is our time to hold these leads this is our job were not getting it done right now
8856378 it would be kind of interesting wouldnt it to play for the nlcs title right here
8856379 i didnt know i had a day off until i saw the situation taking place
8856380 in my mind i thought i was going to face somebody in the eighth but i just work here they know what theyre doing hopefully in september well have extra bullets in our arms
8856381 sometimes they are smarter than we are we just go with our energy and adrenaline im never going to second guess my manager hes the boss if he feels i need a day off so be it but as athletes we like to be out there every day but we still have a few days before september im pretty sure once september arrives you might not see that happen
8856382 hopefully ill be able to finish up strong for them
8856383 i dont know i looked in the stands the whole time
8856384 dubee already told me are you ready to lead the pitchers meeting im not a whole lot of help a couple of the hitters asked how this guy is going to pitch them how is this pitcher going to try to strike me out try to get you to swing and miss three times chase thats what i told chase last night
8856385 so many games are won in the fourth quarter or lost in the fourth quarter so as much as you can you want to keep those guys fresh for the fourth quarter when we go into the fourth quarter i want our best soldiers on the field and you want to press if a guy plays 65 70 plays you go into the fourth quarter and he doesnt have much gas left
8856386 the game has changed a lot in the 13 years ive been in the league
8856387 before defensive linemen had to do everything now you have guys to rush the passer guys playing against the run they used to have to do both you have to study more because youre probably going against more than one guy
8856388 if you get your opportunity and take advantage of it you can play a while because there are a lot of tricks you can learn as you get older
8856389 its because you dont really have to do much more than block people
8856390 a lot of those other guys even if theyre backups are playing on special teams and putting themselves in position where they can get hurt that has a lot to do with it youre asked to do less youre specializing there arent a lot of other things youre doing
8856391 thats when you can get rolled up from behind thats how you get hurt
8856392 i think a lot of the defensive injuries come from friendly fire you know theyre hitting each other during tackles on top of piles and stuff thats how a lot of them get hurt gang tackling but on the offensive line you can control what you hit and how youre getting hit one of the main things we have to protect is our knees getting rolled up on the line of scrimmage
8856393 they know what spot they have to get to so we have to kind of read off their motions thats pretty much the only advantage they have theyre trying to get their hands on us and we have to prevent them from doing that and get our hands on them first you have to learn how to read certain keys so when you see an offensive lineman move a certain way you know how to react thats the biggest thing for us
8856394 theyve probably helped the offensive linemen because they can hold more
8856395 they dont call holding quite as much they let you grab up in here the chest a little bit i dont think they ever put in rules that help the defense theres a rule that you cant touch a receiver after 5 yards everythings changed a little bit to favor the offense
8856396 you have to hold off guys who are 300 some pounds and at the same time try to get to the ball and make reads see where things are at
8856397 i really think everybody has a mutual respect for each other out there
8856398 i think theres actually more skill involved because its very technical
8856399 the players in what are called skill positions are in more of an athletic position theres more skill involved in what we do
8856400 its sad to see it go but i think itll be fun to move to the new stadium
8856401 i think the fans will be great there were some great years and great memories that he was a part of
8856402 were going to put season ticketholders back in their original seats
8856403 i think hes one of the top quarterbacks in the country
8856404 i think he can create a lot of problems for people this year
8856405 hes that double threat of being a runner and a passer he knows where to go with the football what true freshman backup chris whitney didnt have last year was that ability yet to read a defense antwon brings that back
8856406 he can also scramble make some plays that way hes experienced and hes a winner
8856407 he can do a lot of different things to make it happen he worked hard to come back even stronger and faster
8856408 i was actually excited to get into camp just to be able to run around and compete in drills again
8856409 you can get a feel of things from the sideline but sitting outs pretty tough all my friends were out there the quarterbacks supposed to be the leader i felt like i kind of let our team down a little bit because we were doing pretty good
8856410 i actually feel a lot better than i did before the injury ive been working out with the trainers and strength and conditioning coaches through the summer a lot of lower body things im running harder its great
8856411 i cant think about the injury throughout the rehab ive worked on my agility i probably improved on some things im capable of leading the team i feel like im ready for anything
8856412 in high school i really never ran i joke with the coaches a lot that i really dont like to run but when things open up i guess im starting to enjoy becoming a runner
8856413 now i kind of get yelled at every once in awhile if i pitch it
8856414 but as a return man he sure looks like hes got a little zip to him
8856415 the next time if it did happen again like that id probably let that one go
8856416 to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our lineup did against ryan dempster
8856417 it was one of those days where it wasnt going where i wanted it to go
8856418 we got in a situation where we couldnt get people out
8856419 thats why i have to stay away i havent gone to any practices didnt go to camp theyre trying to inch me back ah just go watch for a half hour thats not my style
8856420 somebody will come in to replace me and pretty soon ill be forgotten thats fine with me thats the way i want it
8856421 i understand what vince is always saying to me john youve done it all what more is there to do we had some great times i just know im going to miss the kids from west to northeast to frankford to washington man so many great kids they gave so much theyd do anything for me just like id do anything for them
8856422 maybe afterward ill go see everybody but during the game no cant do that too hard you wont see me on the sideline ill be up in the stands just watching
8856423 i thought he had been playing well enough where he could sit this one out
8856424 i was thinking of that when i decided to sit him
8856425 i cant think of another time right off the top of my head maybe there was one
8856426 i already told donovan hes going to hear from my lawyer
8856427 a guy of his stature in the community should be aware of others feelings here he is making me feel ashamed of something that i cant control
8856428 really this is one of the reasons why i will enjoy playing for this team when your leader is that kind of guy who doesnt allow you to take football too seriously its a lot of fun when you talk about me desean and westbrook were all no higher than 5 10 and im the tallest among the three so i feel pretty good about that
8856429 the head coaches dont run the teams in the national football league
8856430 in the old days if guys got into a fight it was who won
8856431 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
8856432 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it
8856433 im not really worried about whats going to go on
8856434 the coaches they have a lot of decisions to make all around the board not just me just put it in gods hands i just played real hard just left it all out on the field thats been my whole attitude throughout the preseason
8856435 its good when you can just turn it over to god and go out there and play
8856436 take everything else out of it and just go out there its football you grow up playing football your whole life and its supposed to be fun its not supposed to be like eating dirt or whatever sometimes when you put a lot of pressure on yourself you take the fun out of it i really feel like ive turned the corner
8856437 now well go back evaluate the film and make the cuts i thought there were some guys here who really showed well for themselves there were other guys that didnt
8856438 it was my first start although its just the preseason and the starters werent out there with me its still big for me it breaks me in slowly to hopefully what i am going to be one day
8856439 usually when a team gets a big play on you its because people arent doing what theyre supposed to do and blown assignments on the field
8856440 a lot more people are focused and want to do the job
8856441 coach told us after the game last year that were bringing basically the whole team back
8856442 if we make the same mistakes the outcome will not change
8856443 we have more depth and we have more experience so this is a much better team from start to finish
8856444 our football iq is much better our nucleus is strong this year and should be even stronger next year
8856445 im anxious to see what we have were not going to have as many freshmen on the field which will be a big bonus
8856446 they are the bosses they are the ones that run the team and they know what is best for us
8856447 sometimes we just have to stay back and watch even though as an athlete you are very competitive and you want to be there every time but its not that easy we play 162 games and they are trying to do what is smartest for the team so when september comes we can all be ready to go
8856448 all you can do is keep your fingers crossed and do what you can do
8856449 his past three or four times out there down there i understand he was throwing real good
8856450 his command was good he was pitching much better we figured that that is going to be pretty tough on him to pitch him 2 or 3 days in a row
8856451 i dont want to say i wasnt wanted but i kind of got dismissed
8856452 but the best thing is he didnt send me somewhere that doesnt mean anything he sent me to a playoff contending team and ill be forever grateful

8856471 everything was 100 percent focused on the game at hand i think we take that into consideration
8856472 if i had to put a one two three on my question marks
8856473 we do have a depth problem on the offensive line no question about that
8856474 we are still in first we still control what happens well be ok no one in here is worrying
8856475 this is my first varsity game as a head coach
8856476 and second of all we will like to go down as not losing but having a winning season
8856477 we will be the first team to ever play varsity football
8856478 thirty years from now we can look back and say yeah we did ok
8856479 you win a game by using the sound fundamentals that we do or by doing our best
8856480 when you watch someone play it makes you want to get in
8856481 i just dont get intimidated by bigger players ive always been this way
8856482 every football team i played with for 10 years with the frankford chargers youth program through 2006 i was always the smallest didnt let it bother me couldnt be scared about it i always showed the most heart
8856483 about 60 percent of our kids had never played football we stuck to the basics
8856484 everybody was concerned i could see it when they talked to me
8856485 made me feel good anybody that asked i told them what was going on i was worried especially because i didnt have any problems before the physical but dealing with it got better as time went on
8856486 the doctors said he was drinking too many sodas with caffeine
8856487 they kept him out through the winter to be sure but once he stopped drinking so much caffeine everything got back to normal they cleared him in april
8856488 i still have a regular soda every so often but mostly its water or fruit juices
8856489 we have some talent though i think were on the right path
8856490 we have a 14 year old freshman enrique garcia who goes 6 3 280 and is going to be one of the best around
8856491 we have a good team and well go up there with the idea of playing well
8856492 our guys are going to be super juiced i know i will
8856493 we made a majority of the home games the last 2 years when wally started
8856494 id be lying if i said this wasnt a special game to me we get a chance to play in front of more than 100 000 people in the same stadium that my brother played in i never would have imagined something like this when i was younger
8856495 i dont get back to penn state as often as i would have liked mainly because i became a college coach after i finished playing in the nfl
8856496 a lot of those reunions happen during football season so for me it was almost impossible
8856497 they did have a reunion of our teams a few years back i was going to go but i was coaching at the university of connecticut then and tv switched the time of our kickoff from noon to 7 30 p m so that took care of that
8856498 i know jack ham will be there because he does the radio broadcasts for penn state
8856499 i havent gotten a full list of those attending but chuck burkhart and steve smear are in charge of that so theyll be there for sure i heard pete johnson is coming too
8856500 im hoping mike reid comes back and franco harris ted kwalick i want to see them all and it goes without saying of course that i have the deepest respect for my old coach joe paterno
8856501 i liked the idea of playing a team that has so much tradition and support
8856502 penn state does things the right way at coastal we feel that thats what were doing we have a successful program and not just in terms of winning football games to an extent weve modeled our program very much after the penn states of the world
8856503 i told our guys theyd better not get caught looking around with their mouths wide open or they could get embarrassed
8856504 i had never played safety before corner is my natural position
8856505 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8856506 i dont like it the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8856507 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular time needs that
8856508 come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco at first
8856509 its armageddon baseball is a game of human error it always has been and always will be why would you want to take that away i think its dumb
8856510 they should remove two rows of seats in the rightfield stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in leftfield 12 feet that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the 8 foot wall
8856511 they should put wind screens up in the gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and right center
8856512 its the only sign weve missed all year and you only have to look for one thing
8856513 its going out there every game every win is crucial
8856514 all of a sudden you come into this scenario from where i was coming from
8856515 i dont know im not a bat maker and im not a termite so i cant tell you whats good wood and whats bad wood
8856516 im happy to see manny i respect him in my career barry bonds and ramirez have been the two best of my time
8856517 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength

8856786 we have not seen anything like this for the past two decades in terms of what avalon is experiencing
8856787 but finding one needle in an isolated incident is not what we would classify as medical waste wash up
8856788 we came down here to relax and entertain our family
8856789 it will be interesting to learn where this all came from

8856796 it is just not like the state stores when i grew up they are very well run well prepared
8856797 we take this very seriously and we are working with the machine manufacturer to determine the cause of the problem to ensure that this doesnt happen again
8856798 chunk was a big cat with a large bone structure he looked very fat but could carry his weight well
8856799 he only came up in the mid 20 pound range

8856801 i own a 22 pounder and mine looks like a waify thing compared to chunk
8856802 but i cant imagine that the animal lost that much weight
8856803 we dont want to exploit or stress the cat out but we want chunk to continue to be our spokeskitty
8856804 and we were ready for a 44 pound cat hes only 22 youve seen the pictures can you imagine a cat twice that size

8856810 now we need to very aggressively go after new employers
8856811 the gap between the skills that people have and what employers are looking for in entry level employees has widened over the years and continues to widen
8856812 i know this is going to help me do what i want to do in life
8856813 i have to start from the beginning so i can catch up

8856816 for those of us who are old enough this is not the 90s
8856817 even though its more difficult during these periods the skills that people gain are good for life
8856818 six months from now it will pick up its very cyclical
8856819 now the beauty of it is coming out this is what the founding fathers wanted to come about
8856820 since she didnt win my second vote is for obama

8856840 its important to note that in general were taking an iterative organic approach to graphics upgrades going feature by feature as opposed to thinking in terms of an overall new graphics engine
8856841 for example weve discussed plans for new visuals for water but this would be for a future content update or expansion
8856842 we do have some graphics updates coming with wrath of the lich king namely in three areas shadow system shader technology and view distance the shadow system will greatly improve the look of existing shadows and players will be able to display both character and structure shadows

8856847 the implication that the ministry of agriculture and forestry will cease funding any varroa management past july 2009 is seen as the government deserting the beekeeping industry

8856850 we are pleased that the swoose is coming to the national museum of the u s air force
8856851 the transfer between the two federal institutions is a demonstration of good stewardship of our national historic collection our museums restoration staff will use their experience and expertise being gained from the restoration of the famous memphis belle to accurately restore the swoose which is so important to our history
8856852 the transfer of the b 17d the swoose to the national museum of the u s air force is the first step in an historic effort to refine our nations military aircraft collection

8856863 the sports illustrated issue of august 20 2001 has magics doctor citing that magic takes one pill in the morning and one pill in the evening to ostensibly treat his hiv antibody condition however the actual type of pill s are not mentioned and of course they could be just vitamin pills another possibility is magic takes no pills at all but he claims he does because he is was paid by glaxosmithkline to be on billboards and magazine ads to represent the drug combivir with each combivir pill having 300 milligrams of azt and 150 milligrams of 3tc whether magic takes this azt potion is strictly conjectural as all the time people are paid to say they take consume a product whether they actually do or not a last note is that magic weighs close to 300 pounds so if he indeed takes one combibvir a day his dose to weight is a fraction of that so toxic smaller adults and children finally comments from magics publicist during the latter 1990s had magic taking no medications but now with glaxosmithkline paying him probably very hasdsomely to represent their product he may indeed take a token amount who knows the actual truth only magic

8856883 education is the key to unlock the golden door to freedom
8856884 it was you will go to school and you will do well
8856885 it was such a close knit family community if you misbehaved in school your parents knew about it by the time you got home
8856886 you cant walk into whitesboro talking about how youre this or youre that because you grew up with all these people
8856887 they know you they know your mother they know your father they pretty much can call it the way they see it
8856888 there was a time when we felt we were viewed as a town that wasnt going anywhere there was a need for us to prove we could do well
8856889 this means so much to our department and to the future of our department
8856890 so not only are they taking advantage of the generosity theyre really working hard
8856891 a more educated police officer is a better police officer

8856895 one time they took out 80 bags of trash and it never stayed clean
8856896 this year we felt like we needed to have a regular presence
8856897 so starting in april we did one big cleanup month and then we hired two interns
8856898 its definitely been a rewarding experience just in the fact that the amount of trash and graffiti has dwindled off so much with our presence there three days a week
8856899 its not the numbers of people that come here its the way the area is being treated
8856900 economic environmental development systems at large how to manage and implement them
8856901 the middle chapters of the economic environmental development book are my favorite
8856902 i learned many new things about how to manage large economic environmental development operating structures in the workplace which are key to getting the job done quick and dirty
8856903 im think catano warrixs work will be the new bible of the economic environmental development programming industry finally we have something that explains the core principles in both technical and graphical models that allow us to communicate effectively to our employees and executive management
8856904 i agree with blatz linke i think this economic environmental development instructional manual is first rate my colleague pafford turnes may think otherwise but i think we can both agree that this is a quality work that will help de mistify the world of economic environmental development programming architecture
8856905 above all we in the economic environmental development architecture field have a guide that will serve as the foundation of any large project
8856906 and im going to be setting up a special hearing to inform my superiors and subordinates alike about the topics covered in this all important economic environmental development manual
8856907 dont let the criticisms of joffe janeczek get in the way of this great economic environmental development resource

8856911 i am happy with the position of the national working committee nwc that clarified the situation that governors are not leaders of the party in the state
8856912 my response to a letter supposedly written by some elders of the party to the nwc is also against governors being party leaders
8856913 i question the elders where they were when the past administration was assuming leader of the party there should always be a clear distinction on the leadership of the party and head of governance
8856914 i will say that the issue is mainly about loyalty an principles some people could be too principled or loyal to the detriment of the party the fact is that we should always follow party constitutions it is the bedrock of good party politics i believe we will be a democracy that the world would admire with time

8856928 a lawyer is not a liar he is a truthful and perfect human being of intelligence respect courtesy and condour a lawyer is not an interloper intermeddler confusionist or rambler a lawyer is a person who by the sheer dictates of his profession exposes his services to those in need and in trouble
8856929 there s no better way of exercising the imagination than by the study of law
8856930 laws are generally found to be nets of such a texture as the little creep through the great break through and the middle sized are alone entangled in
8856931 everybody talks of the constitution but all sides forget that the constitution is extremely well and would do very well if they would but let it alone
8856932 a lawyer s education is far too important to be left entirely to law schools
8856933 it takes long to train any winning athlete weve followed some of these athletes from the time they were in primary school
8856934 its not as easy as it looks on tv everything is planned to the last detail the job is made harder because you have to read the minds of the other coaches
8856935 we trained at 1pm when it was hot in ngong athi river and in nairobi
8856936 according to the rules the first two finishers automatically qualified for beijing but any athlete from number one to 10 is equally good some of the athletes may not be at their best during trials but their records speak volumes which is why sometimes we take the blame definitely a coach would not make a wrong decision because of what is at stake
8856937 some have to run to school everyday and the talent can be spotted at an early stage
8856938 weve been with some of these coaches from the time we were young and have a lot of faith in them i always listen to the coach and other athletes will tell you so
8856939 she had the potential and peaked at the right time it was a difficult decision because we felt she had a better chance in 800 metres

8856962 the crips and bloods are the focus for law enforcement now not only here but around the region because of the violence they perpetrate
8856963 weve started seeing more and more signs of the crips and bloods more bloods than crips
8856964 we are seeing a growing presence in the graffiti the clothing the symbols
8856965 there is some indication of activity in the district based on tagging graffiti and people flying colors and throwing signs
8856966 i think whats difficult to determine at this point is how much of that activity is associated with people who are actually bloods in sanctioned sets and people who are claiming to be affiliated but are not
8856967 they run around saying we are the ravenswood boys and everybody says so what
8856968 but if they say theyre the ravenswood bloods suddenly they have some credibility

8856972 we believe that the current system of benefits for carers is outdated and we recommend the introduction of two distinctive tiers of support for carers offering income replacement support for carers unable to work or working only part time and compensation for the additional costs of caring for all carers in intensive caring roles
8856973 we believe that the department for work and pensions should support adults who become carers during their working lives to combine work and care and enable those who wish to return to paid work when caring ends or changes to do so
8856974 caring matters deeply to individuals families and society in general sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they give to others is of critical importance
8856975 i think it sends a message and a statement of what we are about
8856976 i think people now understand that actually man city is a place that is an interesting thought for many people at the moment

8856980 in terms of lending the main area of focus remains buy to let where tenant demand remains strong and rents are rising however we plan to reduce mortgage volumes in the second half and into 2009 until more favourable economic conditions return
8856981 this is a strong set of results given the downturn in theuk property market which has demonstrated a greater inclinationby estate agents to cut print advertising as the emphasis hasshifted to finding buyers for rather than sellers of properties
8856982 while the uncertainty in the property market generallyprovide grounds for caution on the risks in the short term aneventual pick up in transaction numbers albeit at lower prices will be supportive
8856983 falls in house prices and increasing levels ofrepossessions while generally bad news should help to restarttransaction volumes at some point though we believe that thereis little immediate prospect of an improvement

8857011 feedback from delegates is always extremely positive there is widespread agreement amongst gps and specialists that the importance of completing medical reports to a high standard is paramount and knowing how to do so effectively as well as give evidence in court is important for gps and specialists in their busy and often hectic lives
8857012 i found this one day course relevant focused and well planned the leader made us all comfortable and encouraged an environment where we were all able to exchange experiences and tips the talks were set at the right level and everyone felt involved and the group tasks were not only great fun but instructive too
8857013 paraphrased he kindly referred me to the assistant principal who dealt with such matters and i had a long conversation with him in the end nothing was accomplished and i felt worse for the wear

8857020 you mean that the us did not say that in exchange for deploying the x band system israel needs to receive us permission to attack iran
8857021 the basic idea is that a us ally getting nuked is a bad thing the x band system increases the likelihood that such an attack would fail
8857022 will send a message to iran that israel has powerful political support from its ally against any iranian threat
8857023 if the israeli government makes the difficult decision that it must launch a preemptive attack against iran that is when israel will need its allies the most and that is when the us will be called in to show what it means to have us as an ally

8857029 its getting really close but there are a couple we are trying to get done
8857030 there is interest in two players that i am aware of but we find ourselves in the position that we havent got a huge amount of players so we have to make sure if one goes out one is certain to come in
8857031 finance isnt the issue it is timing we just want to try and get the right players in
8857032 we have got some decent players in and we are trying to improve on that but there are not a huge amount of players available
8857033 i got told off last week talking about other teams players so ill shut up now
8857034 i got runaway gob so i wont make the same mistake again
8857035 talks have been going on since the summer so to get it signed means that i can now concentrate on my football
8857036 it has taken a little bit longer than myself and the club would have liked but negotiations ran pretty smoothly on both sides i love playing for the club and im settled living in the town
8857037 when i first signed it was obviously a difficult time in my career but i was given that chance at bolton
8857038 to play in europe twice and a carling cup final has been great and last year was probably the most challenging i have had here

8857041 espanyol have decided taking into account the player must leave next sunday to join up with his national team to authorise the player to travel to manchester to take a medical this friday while the english club deals with the documentation of the termination of the argentinian contract with the catalan team
8857042 until this moment espanyol have tried to convince zabaleta to continue in barcelona but the defender has shown his determination to continue his career in the premier league
8857043 i think it sends a message and a statement of what we are about
8857044 i think people now understand that actually man city is a place that is an interesting thought for many people at the moment
8857045 we have the means to attract top quality players which shaun obviously is there arent many days left in the window and hopefully well be able to attract more before it closes

8857057 weve got guys that have never been out of the country before i think its going to be a good experience for them they get a chance to spend some time and bond with each other
8857058 our practice is pretty hard and we practice twice a day so its like a game physically
8857059 that means weve got to play a lot of players
8857060 so everybodyll play a lot of different combinations and well see what the makeup of our guys are
8857061 so as far as the rebounding on the rim were going to be all over that and we play fast anyways
8857062 those lights say its time to be with my teammates and show what weve done in practice
8857063 hes got every tool i think hes an obvious di athlete
8857064 im going to wait until the offseason im just not really worried
8857065 he could be a linebacker he could be a defensive end he could be a tight end
8857066 he needs to work on never taking a play off
8857067 but thats a typical mistake of a sophomore he hasnt had the success he wanted to at the high school level yet
8857068 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8857069 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
8857070 bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8857071 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8857072 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8857073 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
8857074 people of every creed and color from every walk of life
8857075 is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8857076 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8857077 i get it i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8857078 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8857079 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8857080 the republicans are going to have their turn and theyll have a whole lot of fun with us and they will change some minds and persuade and then the race is on
8857081 were going to have to work as hard as we can
8857082 its his turn hes a sharp kid hes technically sound i have all the faith in the world hes going to do a good job because hes a student of the game if theres one word to describe him its disciplined hes a very disciplined individual
8857083 based on the information provided to us by texas tech there doesnt appear to be a violation
8857084 the appropriate people at the ncaa agreed with what we presented to them
8857085 were still going to run dont get me wrong but were just doing it in a different way
8857086 were so inexperienced with fundamentals learning how to practice and toughness its a process and were trying to work through it
8857087 i dont think were changing the identity of the team i think we can have that same style with being a little bit different with formations
8857088 just because were not under center and were not in the i formation doesnt mean that were not a downhill running football team
8857089 hes smart about getting people lined up hes done a good job of learning the system he wants to know whats going on and he wants to know what the defense is doing
8857090 yes its hard learning a whole new offense but the way thomas teaches it and the way weve worked on it its been a lot easier than youd think
8857091 i know the passion that they have for the game of football as coaches
8857092 i love staffs that want to be intense and want to coach football and theres no doubt that the staff here at hickman does that
8857093 eu queria vincular o neg cio a uma mensagem para as pessoas sexualmente activas

8857099 mesmo assim algumas companhias colocam preservativos nas suas casas de banho e quando se vai ver a cada dia as caixas est o vazias eu n o me importo se os preservativos est o a ser usados entre quatro paredes ou em p blico contanto que muitas pessoas os utilizem

8857110 effectively the nzru will be paying for the players payments
8857111 if we didnt they would not have been able to carry on and we would have been up for that amount to pay the players anyway
8857112 we dont want the competition to be disrupted and tasman if it withdrew could have impacted on other provincial unions
8857113 we are seeking further information before we think about challenging the nzru

8857116 whoever is responsible for abandoning this foal is a heartless coward and has no justification for doing so
8857117 researchers in the us say that they have solved the mystery of why flies are so hard to swat they think the flys ability to dodge being hit is due to its fast acting brain and an ability to plan ahead
8857118 this year we dont have a superstar player like graduated standout jeremy hargis its more of a team concept now and they have been pulling together these guys have big hearts and will never quit
8857119 so it just makes good sense for us to have a greater presence in that area this is a nice way to get started and then watch it grow
8857120 its a fast growing part of aiken county and one that has rapid access to us
8857121 august through january is the perfect time to plant crinum lily bulbs
8857122 i dont especially have a plan or a color theme or anything like that
8857123 theyre plants you can trust you dont have to worry about them
8857124 she loves digging potatoes its like finding easter eggs she appreciates the garden i try to instill these things in her
8857125 if you listen to him speak he just makes sense im with michelle obama ive never been so proud of my country
8857126 that really means a lot to families and students with tuition going up 5 percent here every year
8857127 im just learning more and more as i listen to him
8857128 its because of 1963 that were possibly going to have the first black president of the united states
8857129 when they see him speak they see what was not yet present when i was their age hope
8857130 you never know what the master is going to do god works in mysterious ways and barack obama is our man
8857131 this world is made for all of us god bless america
8857132 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it
8857133 we need a government that cares more about barney smith than smith barney
8857134 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8857135 if not us who is going to do this kind of thing
8857136 if a kid knows what to do he can do it a lot faster i have seen a lot of evidence of that we just appear to be so much stronger and on the defensive side we appear to be tackling a lot better
8857137 were a work in progress right now weve got a lot of new faces some players kind of saw time in there last year we just dont have lot of game experience were young as far as experience is concerned weve just got to try to stay healthy try not to make a lot of mistakes and try to bring them along slowly
8857138 i think williston elko is the frontrunner in the region because they have pretty much everybody back berry said the hawks last region title was in 2005
8857139 congratulations not just for the second half but for a great year
8857140 what made it better is the fact that we clinched
8857141 its a great feeling obviously its something you work for the whole year what does it is when you play as a team and thats what we did tonight
8857142 if you have a good team and you have the seasons weve had
8857143 is if we were playing the boston celtics on st patricks day in the boston garden
8857144 we can no longer say were younger than everybody we have nineteen kids seven are juniors and six are sophomores those juniors and sophomores have played in every single football game while theyve been here
8857145 another big thing is the change in region last year in single a four teams went to the playoffs but two of those teams were thomas jefferson and flint river which went to the title game that left seven teams fighting for two spots this year in double a we have five teams in our region and four go to the playoffs being in double a is going to have its disadvantages because the teams are better but it has its advantages as well
8857146 following a competitive process we selected atos origin because it demonstrated that it understands our needs and has the capability and experience to deliver
8857147 were young but i do think well be better i cant say weve ever gone this long without a win but were itching for one
8857148 i feel like we can do good things this season barring injuries weve got more players than weve ever had but we still dont have that many if players get hurt we dont have depth to fill in for them
8857149 do all fairy tales start with once upon a time
8857150 der er flere der kommer til at kende mig det er pludselig ikke kun et bestemt segment eller den fanbase jeg normalt henvender mig til men ogs hele familien danmark der sidder og kigger med

8857152 we walk into new communities that we dont know anything about we need them to know there is a resource for them that knows the local community and can guide them to businesses that are ethical
8857153 i have lived through what some of our young families go through and i knew what was of concern to them
8857154 theyre young inexperienced and they need a lot of educating the army community services does a great job of that and the better business bureau is here to supplement that
8857155 just because it has good graphics and looks reputable doesnt mean that it is
8857156 i know its not easy but you dont want to dig yourself in a deep hole thats so difficult to dig out of
8857157 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
8857158 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it
8857159 the housing market and land market are entirely different animals
8857160 you have folks making 50 000 a year who can afford to buy a house out there in the land market its a different clientele mainly richer folks
8857161 some folks with money are running from the stock market and investing in raw land because they feel the trend as the study said has been to hold its value and it will continue to hold its value
8857162 because of the economy the demand may have fallen off in the past 12 months but the price has not
8857163 and its not just georgia aiken for example is saturated with horse enthusiasts from florida and that can have a major influence in making prices higher
8857164 i also think the fact that we have such a major metropolitan area in the state like atlanta with the population growing so fast helps keep up a demand
8857165 people want to move to land farther out and have the money to pay for it
8857166 we do know a weapon was found but it was found off campus
8857167 of course our main concern is the safety of the students and were wanting to know why he was in possession of the weapon

8857181 some changes have been made and change always sparks interest for a little while we return a good many weve just got to grow up in a hurry we lost some key people but we return a lot weve got to have some young guys step in and fill some spots if they step up well be ok
8857182 four of the games we lost were very close weve got to get over the hump and cut out those mistakes id like to get those wins
8857183 i expect us to be much improved and to make steps towards to making to game 11 somehow some way i dont know if well get there this season but well get there eventually
8857184 because its the next one we cant afford to look at games down the line

8857207 i dont see where a game this early is that much of a factor when you get into the home visits and the actual nuts and bolts recruiting
8857208 for every 15 16 or 17 year old kid home on saturday night thats the game they want to play in
8857209 they want to go to a school that plays in that game thats big from a recruiting standpoint to market the university those things are hard to pass up
8857210 i dont particularly like people trying to grab our players and having a presence in the state but they were smart enough to do it and im sure it will be a good game
8857211 i think thats something that needs to be discussed and looked at
8857212 this event is going to be the daytona 500 of college football
8857213 we think weve created the biggest and best celebration to start the college football season and were going to host this event every year capped off by a great matchup of two premier teams
8857214 they read a lot more every day about georgia or georgia tech than clemson
8857215 so i think this is going to help me more nationally than regionally
8857216 some schools dont get invited those are the schools you dont want to go to the ones who never get invited
8857217 ive always believed in myself you kind of have to
8857218 even though this rivalry is really competitive at the same time theres no hatred or hard feelings
8857219 we have a name for those types two play three play offers
8857220 if youre 6 6 298 as a junior you have a lot of upside but you dont know how to carry that weight youre not physically mature coaches see this size and know the kid can be special theyll take chances
8857221 im still listening but i would say im close to 100 percent
8857222 we raise our kids to be a person of their word
8857223 thats the only advice we gave him i cant see him changing his mind but the decision will be his
8857224 our goal is to use fishing as a way to say thank you to the men and women of our armed forces for the contributions they make for our country
8857225 my father if it is possible may this cup be taken from me yet not as i will but as you will

8857227 er is nog geen recessie maar die dreigt wel rondom ons zien we verontrustende cijfers over het tweede kwartaal het komende werkjaar zullen we meer faillissementen zien en belangrijke herstructureringen
8857228 voor het bedrijfsleven wordt 2008 het jaar waarin de aantrekkelijkheid van vooral de industrie een historische klap dreigt te krijgen vergelijk dat met duitsland waar twee derde van de nieuwe jobs in de industrie gecre erd zijn in belgi was de sociale vrede in 2008 tot nog toe slecht maar werden tegelijk de verloningsbudgetten van de ondernemingen ruim overschreden toch leeft bij de werknemers de perceptie dat de werkgevers niet veel doen
8857229 its disappointing for sure but the car just got sideways and on full opposite lock i ended up cutting a corner too much and it just went over
8857230 we were pushing pretty hard this morning and maybe a little harder after the service but its just disappointing that we werent able to get closer to the pace
8857231 we seem to be giving away a little more in the slow stuff than the fast but then its all relative as there are fewer corners in the fast
8857232 the grip was pretty tricky this morning but much better on the second passes as road cleaning from the cars ahead of him is a big factor
8857233 theres no miracle cure as theres no single thing we can pinpoint but well take tomorrow as more testing and mileage and see what were able to do
8857234 it would give cricket a global audience and help stimulate our push into markets like china and north america

8857237 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it
8857238 we need a government that cares more about barney smith than smith barney
8857239 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first

8857332 im excited about the future possibilities in our online gaming economy industry
8857333 because i know in the long run its all going to work out just fine
8857334 the last thing i want to do is send people home because thats against our companys mission statement
8857335 and also because we can reallocate our human capital to work on other projects that will be beneficial while the consumer market slows down
8857336 its true were laying off workers because of the economy but the ones were laying off are employees that contribute little to our operations our best employees continue to hold their jobs and will continue with us as long as they maintain their excellent records further were going to reward our online gaming economy market analysts who are in high demand with a cost of living raise plus 2 of their salaries
8857337 but i am confident of long term gains that will help drive the online gaming economy market area forward
8857338 simply because having too many workers becomes unproductive well let portions of our employees take time off for their families when theyre recharged and ready to tackle the demands of the online gaming economy consumer demand well open our doors once again in the meantime lets be cautious and not jump to conclusions
8857339 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market
8857340 i trust the word of carolyn frankenreiter especially in these times
8857341 and will look to other analysts of the same ilk to gauge how we move forward in this environment

8857364 i see him as the precursor to martin luther king

8857372 for months after the first stent was implanted i felt stunned and out of sorts not knowing what to do with my life or how much life i had left
8857373 by some strange paradox the wounding of my heart has opened me up to the world
8857374 i had this idea to spend 40 days reflecting and writing about my experience
8857375 it helped to be in that trance and that mode then after those 40 days i reached another level of progress and it put it further behind me
8857376 that was a more spiritual part of the necessary progression the labyrinth is a unifying pattern and is a lot like life you keep changing direction while walking but eventually you get to the center of things
8857377 when the heart attack struck me it demolished any illusions that i was in control of my future and it provided overwhelming and irrefutable evidence that there are forces at hand that can eradicate me in a flash

8857387 its a sad day when you have this much money spent on police officers and the poor only have their voice and we cant allow that to be taken from us

8857417 when bishop edward k braxton returns early next week he will meet with diocesan officials to determine a course of action we pray that for all of us this is a point from which we can move forward and truly begin to heal
8857418 obviously this trial has made it clear that the policy that they have in effect right now does not work
8857419 we know that documents regarding father kownacki were withheld from the review board there might be other documents that perhaps have been concealed from bishop braxton like there were from bishop gregory
8857420 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8857421 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8857422 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8857423 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8857424 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8857425 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8857426 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8857427 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8857428 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8857429 we took our kids down there we just got involved with the re enacting group a year ago its been great
8857430 these are difficult decisions to make difficult decisions that we dont want to make
8857431 that being said weve spent the last two months working with agencies to ensure that theyre going to maintain their core services
8857432 its like i dont trust them to do their best without a bonus and they know it
8857433 it sets up this stupid game and now people have excuses for their behavior im not going to do this or that because i dont get a bonus for it and people are smart if this is the game they will figure out how to take advantage
8857434 how much of your responsibility as a manager have you abandoned thinking a bonus will be an effective substitute
8857435 credit growth is actually slowing so the rba has actually achieved what it wanted to do by raising rates and slowing domestic demand as well as the rate of domestic credit
8857436 now is the time to get out on the front foot
8857437 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude youve got to start doing something before that day
8857438 we think they will cut rates to mitigate the downside risks from that
8857439 we dont think they may be as aggressive as past easing cycles
8857440 by the middle of next year it will be clear that inflation is heading down and the reserve bank will have cut interest rates by over 100 basis points

8857461 it now seems more likely although still far from certain that the mpc may feel a need to cut rates before the end of this year
8857462 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition
8857463 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8857464 to what extent unemployment increases between now and the autumn will be key to the level of pay awards we see at the start of the major bargaining activity in january 2009

8857485 there she was the victim of a rape perpetrated by an individual who is now being sought
8857486 at this point there is no certitude that the rapist is a migrant
8857487 i always advise journalists not to visit the squats and i even discourage people working for us from going there

8857490 the market is being driven more by external factors the drop in oil prices and the us economic numbers that were released overnight
8857491 yes we wrote a letter to the in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8857492 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8857493 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their
8857494 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money money money money money
8857495 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job
8857496 diese ausstellung macht richtig spa ich freue mich sehr auf das erscheinen des buches
8857497 dieser kongress ist eine hervorragende plattform f r unsere ausstellung
8857498 wir sind von der sichtbaren begeisterung der teilnehmer sehr angetan vor allem dieses breite interesse der internationalen experten empfinden wir als gro e ehre
8857499 we spend a lot time working with our designers on the homepage
8857500 and once the home page is solid we use it as a template to create other pages on the website consistency and easy of use are absolutely paramount especially in our gaming website design industry
8857501 it takes a discplined and creative approach to get your message across
8857502 and some times a little luck and good old fashioned word of mouth advertising
8857503 be 100 certain that your shopping cart and check out process are super easy to use
8857504 or else confused customers will simply bail out and not complete their purchase
8857505 dont forget that gaming website design affiliate programs are a great way to drive customers towards your site
8857506 you may have to pay up to 25 for an affiliate lead but in the long run youre making a hell of a lot more money than you would without affiliate traffic youll find that the top 20 of your affiliates count for nearly 80 of all your income so be sure to take care of your business partners
8857507 and the old adage you have to spend money to make money applies dont go cheap on your websites checkout process or navigational menus instead save money by using simple content generation software and ready made blog software these steps will ensure quality at the right price
8857508 fancy drop down menus and fast moving flash graphics are great for catching the users eye but when you want to get down to business make sure your site presents an easy navigation menu and map this will allow most gaming website design users to get what they are after and at the same time be wowed by your graphical presentations
8857509 in politics each of us has a reputation and obviously peters is very keen as any of us would be to defend his reputation and he will be offering total cooperation to the serious fraud office
8857510 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address their matters expeditiously
8857511 you dont ask for them to come along but you have to deal with them and i am endeavouring to deal with this in a way which is fair and has some dignity about it
8857512 as someone who has been in politics a long time i know how precious a reputation is and how hurt people get when theres a serious assault on their reputation
8857513 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8857514 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between glenn and peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8857515 the flames the oilers the calgary hitmen the edmonton oil kings hockey alberta everybody lined up to be a part of this and that just doesnt happen everywhere in our country
8857516 every year the tournament has been held in canada the bar has been raised
8857517 it started in red deer and its continued on in winnipeg halifax and vancouver
8857518 i truly believe that when edmonton and calgary host this tournament in 2012 it could be the best in history
8857519 my expectation would be that we will have another minority i think thats the reality of the current political environment
8857520 i think anyone getting a majority in the current political alignment we have in canada would be unlikely
8857521 its a lot harder to get a divorce if youre not married
8857522 i think that some people are trying to figure out some bottoming process and they might have come in here and come in early or they may feel a trading stance is warranted
8857523 sometimes it just takes a lack of horrendous news to allow something to fall back up if you push a spring down hard enough it will snap back at you almost every time even one thats pretty rusty and old
8857524 you cannot have enough friends in business toi make more moolah for each other
8857525 i like the format of being able to share your information with the group three quick times repetition helps people remember you better the group is large but friendly and welcoming
8857526 this game is going to be super important because it is kind of like a playoff game
8857527 this can make or break our season right here just one win and we can be ahead of calgary
8857528 you watch henry burris throwing the ball to nik lewis ken yon rambo jeremaine copeland and handing off the ball to joffrey reynolds they are exciting to watch they are very well coached
8857529 if i would tell you that i am not overly concerned i would be lying to you
8857530 we are going to have our hands full and we are going to have to play really really well to try to contain them
8857531 it is all about taking ownership the players have taken ownership and we are going to stay on top of them
8857532 we are coming off a win here and we have got about 525 in fines to collect
8857533 we want to make sure that we are not going to self destruct out there by giving somebody an opportunity to keep a drive alive on a silly penalty
8857534 he has nothing to lose hes a good puncher and he has a good amateur background
8857535 but steve is going to be at the top of his game hes just so strong much more powerful than most guys at 122 lbs he just hasnt been able to show it yet but hes such a great fighter you dont want to try to change him in five weeks that would be stupid
8857536 steve has tremendous potential but i still see a lot of room for improvement
8857537 im not looking to rebuild his boxing ability but i figure he can save energy here and there be looser and have some more power at this stage small details mean everything
8857538 labarda said he felt an illusion earlier that he was going to come over here and win well ill show hes right it was an illusion
8857539 i know he has everything to gain and nothing to lose but im not taking him or anyone else lightly
8857540 im well prepared for this fight like all my fights
8857541 everywhere i go i put on a good show and im going to win on friday i hope everybody enjoys the fight

8857545 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8857546 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting
8857547 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture
8857548 this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8857549 with this deal axier se can offer their customers the possibility to trade in financial instruments on our cfd trading platform
8857550 axier se with their network and their knowledge adds a lot of value for us and we have high expectations on the cooperation with them
8857551 it is encouraging to see so many accounts offering attractive headline rates but savers need to keep their wits about them to avoid choosing an unsuitable account
8857552 the total investment of the project is expected to be about 3bn
8857553 generations from now we will be able to look back
8857554 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal

8857563 ladies and gentlemen in recent years and in recent days weve once again seen the consequences of the neglect of this neglect with russia challenging the very freedom of a new democratic country of georgia
8857564 barack and i will end that neglect we will hold russia accountable for its actions and we will help the people of georgia rebuild
8857565 our research has confirmed that both mortgage lending and unsecured loans are drying up by the day
8857566 whilst its good news that people can still access extra money if they need it this is not a sustainable solution for the problem
8857567 the draw is the draw theres nothing to do about it
8857568 even after seeing the teams we will play you dont know if it will be an easy or difficult first phase
8857569 our first objective is to get to the next phase the second is to try to do so as group b winners
8857570 of course were really motivated and confident we want to start playing the as soon as possible
8857571 for us its great to be welcomed back to the champions league with a classic encounter against real madrid
8857572 but theres also zenit who represent the progression of east european teams our players need to remember that theyre playing at the highest level and that juve are back
8857573 it seems like a good group to me certainly an interesting one
8857574 that team has something extra however weve attained a certain level over the last few years and i think thats something the players should cherish like a treasure

8857576 sin embargo la comprobaci n de que la pobreza es m s generalizada de lo que pens bamos invita a la reflexi n y significa que debemos redoblar los esfuerzos sobre todo en frica al sur del sahara
8857577 nuestra ltima revisi n de las cifras de la pobreza es la m s amplia que se ha realizado hasta el momento debido a que estos nuevos e importantes datos revelan que el costo de vida en el mundo en desarrollo es m s alto de lo que pens bamos
8857578 las nuevas estimaciones constituyen un gran avance en la medici n de la pobreza mundial porque se basan en datos sobre precios mucho m s exactos para asegurar que las l neas de pobreza sean comparables entre pa ses
8857579 el objetivo de la nueva l nea internacional de pobreza no es reemplazar las l neas nacionales de pobreza
8857580 al medir la pobreza y debatir las pol ticas apropiadas para un pa s en particular uno deber a utilizar naturalmente una l nea de pobreza que se considere apropiada para ese pa s y que no necesariamente coincida con nuestra l nea internacional
8857581 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful against poverty
8857582 aun a este ritmo en 2015 cerca de 1 000 millones de personas todav a vivir n con menos de us 1 25 al d a
8857583 y muchos de los que superaron el umbral de pobreza de us 1 25 al d a entre 1981 y 2005 todav a ser an pobres de acuerdo con los niveles de los pa ses ricos o incluso de ingreso mediano
8857584 los datos nunca son perfectos pero han ido mejorando con el tiempo
8857585 el banco mundial trabaja constantemente con asociados de pa ses en desarrollo para mejorar la calidad de los datos y el acceso a la informaci n
8857586 las estimaciones m s recientes sobre la pobreza se basan en 675 encuestas de hogares correspondientes a 116 pa ses en desarrollo que representan el 96 de la poblaci n del mundo en desarrollo
8857587 hace 20 a os s lo pod amos realizar estos c lculos adecuadamente para 22 pa ses esto supone un gran avance en nuestros conocimientos sobre la pobreza en el mundo

8857637 until this moment espanyol have tried to convince zabaleta to continue in barcelona but the defender has shown his determination to continue his career in the premier league
8857638 ljungberg will not be coming definitely not we have no interest in him motta is here at the moment and we are having at look at him

8857649 there were great expectations and hopes that we would buy heavily this summer
8857650 its not our decision who he wenger spends money on nor will it ever be our decision
8857651 if he said to us i want this guy and hes 30million can i buy him the answer is yes absolutely yes
8857652 we totally back him its his decision if arsene found the right player he would buy that player but at the moment his hasnt
8857653 theres a dual problem for him if we buy star names you are talking about relatively mature players who need to be integrated into the way arsene plays they dont know our style and it also impacts on the youngsters who have been brought through
8857654 qui n te ha visto y qui n te ve
8857655 people were yelling at us the most horrible things you can imagine and mater dei parents were yelling back
8857656 hey it was a matter of welcome to d 1 division i football
8857657 its hard to look back now and remember what those days are like
8857658 he was making typical freshman mistakes he was getting frustrated i was getting frustrated everyone thought rollinson was an idiot if you had told me 10 years earlier i would be playing a freshman quarterback i would have laughed you out of the room
8857659 but you generally only had to tell him things once and he was handling all our time demands as well as honors courses on the freshman level i told bev and les they might want to lighten his course load a little bit but they kept saying no hell handle it hes all right
8857660 they used to have a special set of toys set aside for him at school
8857661 he didnt stop until he was finished but now his freshman year it was beginning to pile up on him
8857662 hed come home at 9 p m after practice then hed go right to his homework finally we told him he had to stop at midnight that we didnt care what his grades were that he had to get some rest he had to get up at 6 or so to get to school the next day
8857663 he just does not get rattled because he has tremendous confidence
8857664 he has a great way of leading now hes coaching the younger guys and we have a lot of them and its great to see
8857665 high school football is a quarterbacks game weve got the quarterback

8857668 robbie and sam are the ones who might as well be brothers
8857669 theyre hunters sams a strong safety very outgoing and exuberant matts more mellow
8857670 but theres a chance sam will get to run some offense
8857671 i cant think of anything better than throwing him a touchdown pass for mater dei
8857672 usually its the father who is pushing his kid to play quarterback for me
8857673 theres a lot of quarterback shopping going on these days this time i thought well now thats different
8857674 we went into our passing league schedule and matt threw a 35 yard touchdown at edison his very first pass he gave us our best chance
8857675 they didnt really cut down the playbook just because i was a freshman
8857676 i could change a play from one side or the other if i needed to this was a different level but i felt i was prepared
8857677 the most impressive thing about that whole freshman year was that matt never complained
8857678 he never said it was too much he never felt sorry for himself he never wanted us to help him after that was all over we felt more comfortable

8857691 her first awareness of him is a presence unseen a stench it comes around the corner before him preceeding his physical entrance in a sickening downdraft that washes over her and she recoils from the smell which is a combination of rank body odor and sewage and sulfurous stink of rotten food and it assails her nostrils with the foulness of evil then seeing him she flinches again fighting to regain her composure resolutely politely trained to serve the public a smile fixing itself to her mouth as he approaches the counter in his awful stinking swirl of poisonous air
8857692 he thinks how easily he could have killed the aloof woman behind the counter how pleasant it would have been to sink a sharp object into her throat ripping down across the breasts and then the abdomen and then gutting her and taking the parts he liked best and the thought of this fills his head with a scarlet roar

8857763 well recover on thursday sit down and talk about it and show some dvd evidence and hopefully some lessons will be learned from this game

8857880 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico

8857892 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
8857893 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
8857894 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
8857895 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

8857919 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
8857920 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
8857921 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
8857922 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
8857923 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
8857924 intercambio de informaci n para una mayor operatividad en la regi n de la araucan a fue el objetivo de la reuni n de seguridad que convoc el ministerio del interior y que tuvo la participaci n de la polic a civil carabineros la agencia nacional de inteligencia y un representante del fiscal nacional sabas chahu n quien no estuvo presente
8857925 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
8857926 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
8857927 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
8857928 toda la historia que a nosotros nos han contado viene del otro del mundo winka de se ores con apellidos aristocr ticos de la zona central el objetivo de este trabajo es colocar al mapuche en primera persona como gestor de su propia historia

8857932 entre dos provincias chilenas concepci n y valdivia se intercala un pedazo de pa s que no es provincia donde se habla distinto siendo habitada por otra gente y que a n puede decirse que no es chile s chile se llama el pa s donde flota su bandera y son obedecidas sus leyes
8857933 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8857934 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino
8857935 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches
8857936 nuestros reci n llegados gobernantes se propusieron decretar que no somos un pa s de indios este decreto perfumado no ha tenido expresi n parlamentaria pero la verdad es que circula t citamente la araucana est bien huele bien los araucanos est n mal huelen mal huelen a raza vencida como fren ticos arribistas nos avergonzamos de los araucanos contribuimos los unos a extirparlos y los otros a sepultarlos en el abandono y el olvido
8857937 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n
8857938 es un conflicto que el estado le ha instalado a la comunidad paichil antriao
8857939 el estado ha ido de alg n modo violentando permanentemente el derecho a la consulta y participaci n de la comunidad

8857942 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
8857943 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
8857944 hay que cambiar la forma de interdependencia entre los seres humanos y dar pie a relaciones nuevas donde la econom a se preocupe del ser humano

8857952 judicial independence and the supremacy of law are central to your philosophy of law and shine through in all you have done and written
8857953 you have worked to strengthen judicial institutions and the sense of a national judicial identity

8857959 these guys want to try a little more of everything
8857960 if you have a mobility impairment gravity is your enemy
8857961 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8857962 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
8857963 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
8857964 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
8857965 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
8857966 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
8857967 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
8857968 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
8857969 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
8857970 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
8857971 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
8857972 russia knows well that the us is involved in conflicts in several parts of the world where it needs russias support such as afghanistan
8857973 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated
8857974 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8857975 we havent got a bottle to work on lets not underestimate how difficult it will be for us to get to the bottom of this
8857976 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8857977 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8857978 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8857979 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8857980 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8857981 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8857982 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8857983 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
8857984 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
8857985 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
8857986 la escuela en un alto grado es una fuente de cultivo para el racismo la discriminaci n la negaci n de todo lo mapuche

8857988 disminuye la cantidad de hablantes y se interrumpe el aprendizaje por las nuevas ge ne ra ciones
8857989 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
8857990 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8857991 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8857992 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8857993 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos

8857998 its ok its only sex you dont want to die do you
8857999 you appear to be someone with an inability to form long term relationships and at 30 years of age you lack sexual experience
8858000 you have continued to deny any wrongdoing and to blame the victim
8858001 the pre sentence report suggests you have disturbed views about sexual entitlement and appropriate sexual behaviour
8858002 i have read the 21 year old victims impact statement she has become very anxious around strangers and feels stressed and frightened if she is on her own
8858003 this incident has had a very significant impact on her life there was no physical injury of consequence to her but the psychological impact is self evident
8858004 republican mismanagement has really hit home around the kitchen table
8858005 at kitchen tables across ohio and the heartland mothers and fathers are worried
8858006 tonight families are balancing checkbooks at kitchen tables trying to stay on budget
8858007 i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8858008 its a wonderful image its an image that stays with you because it mirrors reality
8858009 the symbol of all things practical and all things comforting
8858010 you dont invite the stranger into the kitchen unless you really like them the living room is preserved for that
8858011 many people dont make as formal meals anymore so the kitchen table becomes a place where a lot does happen
8858012 if youre not in the kitchen youre going to miss out
8858013 the kitchen itself is really becoming a living room in american homes
8858014 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8858015 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell
8858016 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8858017 i was just kind of a void i did seem to function all right but i was just kind of out of it
8858018 when you lose a son or daughter in a war theres a purpose to that but when you lose a son or daughter to a drunken driver theres no purpose to that
8858019 these are made of steel and the reason we chose steel is because of the way people die
8858020 theyre literally killed by a steel machine in fact weve done a lot of things here in steel for that very reason
8858021 it perpetually represents five years so every year its adjusted
8858022 someday we will have a place where children can play
8858023 we wont have any deaths by dwi someday thats going to happen
8858024 i couldve stopped with new mexico but i just kept thinking you know theres no reason why weve got the room why cant we just represent the whole nation
8858025 we arent aware of anything else that is on the same scale as what new mexico is doing
8858026 its such a great way to honor victims of drunk driving
8858027 id like to see the states join is send us any material that they would like for us to display to show on our videos to have available for the public that stops here i want this to become a center for dwi information and the states efforts against it
8858028 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8858029 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8858030 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8858031 generations from now we will be able to look back
8858032 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
8858033 not just to change america but to change the world
8858034 a girl from the south side of chicago and the son of a single mother from hawaii
8858035 i felt like this was a chance for us to make a statement
8858036 and thats why i feel so disappointed for the people that this affected
8858037 the thing that is really painful to me and to our staff is that we want to give people a reason to believe and you want to keep them around
8858038 you want to keep them excited and we did not do that tonight
8858039 that to me is very disturbing so i am embarrassed that i think we did not do a good job in representing baylor university
8858040 you cant do that against anybody youre not going to win many football games if you cant win the turnover battle
8858041 four years ago i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8858042 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8858043 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8858044 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8858045 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8858046 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8858047 were just thankful that weve been able to live to see such a day as this
8858048 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8858049 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8858050 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8858051 the question that i have and i know many other americans have is senator obama what have you done and what have you run and when you look at those two questions the answer is not much and nothing
8858052 they can criticize we organize when weve won colorado on the night of nov 4 i will get special satisfaction out of that based on some of their criticisms this week that seem to forget that this is a battleground state that will be closely contested
8858053 after this week colorado will be one of our strongest organizations in the country
8858054 this is the best i have felt since early in houston
8858055 i have played decent games where i have not felt good
8858056 i felt i sporadically made plays and things lucked into happening tonight i was in control of what was going on and that hasnt happened in a long time
8858057 when the regular season starts its a whole new ballgame
8858058 we know that is it nice to win the games yeah but it doesnt mean anything weve had good records in preseason weve had bad records in preseason what counts is how you play in the regular season
8858059 yes we wrote a letter to the in 2003 saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
8858060 what can you do without writing that letter you will not be able to get rid of the sanction i admit we played with the words we had to we had to there was no other solution
8858061 i think they the families were very greedy and they were trading with the blood of their
8858062 the position with them it was very terrible and it was very materialistic and it was very greedy and they were asking for money and more money and more money and more money money money money money
8858063 i dont think that poor guy is behind that sophisticated operation im sure that that poor guy is not sophisticated and clever and capable enough to carry out that job
8858064 some people find it helpful to go to the cemetery and grieve and they leave their grief in the cemetery
8858065 there are some people who for whatever reason do not want to have this farewell
8858066 some people find it is a great honour and remembrance
8858067 my family will cherish this diamond for generations and i expect other families will want to do the same
8858068 weve known john for a while he was in triphammer back in the day it was rich spillberg who suggested john to the band and the rest is history
8858069 it was acutally the people from our area that forgot about us everywhere else they remembered us which took us all by pleasant surprise
8858070 better than it is now but it still wasnt as good as ri ct ny the clubs we played with some sort of regularity back then was celebrations at the kenmore club paradise channel salem theater
8858071 i dont follow the metal scene too closely to be honest i can tell you the newer bands that i really like are dream evil firewind circle 2 circle and kamelot i listen to more of the old stuff although i dont listen to too many other bands when im busy writing for steel assassin
8858072 republican mismanagement has really hit home around the kitchen table
8858073 at kitchen tables across ohio and the heartland mothers and fathers are worried
8858074 tonight families are balancing checkbooks at kitchen tables trying to stay on budget
8858075 i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8858076 its a wonderful image its an image that stays with you because it mirrors reality
8858077 the symbol of all things practical and all things comforting
8858078 you dont invite the stranger into the kitchen unless you really like them the living room is preserved for that
8858079 many people dont make as formal meals anymore so the kitchen table becomes a place where a lot does happen
8858080 if youre not in the kitchen youre going to miss out
8858081 the kitchen itself is really becoming a living room in american homes
8858082 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8858083 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell
8858084 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8858085 judicial independence and the supremacy of law are central to your philosophy of law and shine through in all you have done and written
8858086 you have worked to strengthen judicial institutions and the sense of a national judicial identity
8858087 it has been a great privilege to serve as chief justice of this court and of australia
8858088 i extend to him my warmest wishes for a happy and successful term of office

8858090 protecting the polar bears is something we are committed to but we going to base it on science and with input and collaboration with inuit and northern people
8858091 our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation a perilous dependence on imported oil a refusal to lead on global warming a growing indebtedness and a dependence on foreign lenders a severely burdened military a backsliding on global non proliferation and arms control agreements and a failure to consistently use the power of diplomacy from the middle east to africa to latin america to central and eastern europe clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and restore americas standing in the world everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job he will work for an america with more partners and fewer adversaries he will rebuild our frayed alliances and revitalize the international institutions which help to share the costs of the worlds problems and to leverage our power and influence he will put us back in the forefront of the worlds fight to reduce nuclear chemical and biological weapons and to stop global warming he will continue and enhance our nations global leadership in an area in which i am deeply involved the fight against aids tb and malaria including a renewal of the battle against hiv aids here at home he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort but in a world troubled by terror by trafficking in weapons drugs and people by human rights abuses by other threats to our security our interests and our values when he cannot convert adversaries into partners he will stand up to them barack obama also will not allow the worlds problems to obscure its opportunities everywhere in rich and poor countries alike hardworking people need good jobs secure affordable healthcare food and energy quality education for their children and economically beneficial ways to fight global warming these challenges cry out for american ideas and american innovation when barack obama unleashes them america will save lives win new allies open new markets and create new jobs for our people most important barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8858092 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
8858093 i start with 600 jumping rope broken up with sets of pushups starting at 20 and progressing in volume until at the last set with nearly 100 pushups
8858094 as once before when as a young lad i was capable of about 600 700 full situps and a 5 minute l off the ground tremendous and noteworthy abdominal accomplishments i can again feel my abdominis rectus muscle wall beneath a layer of subcutaneous fat my abdominal wall is again large thick and powerful i have put so very little into them and ive made such remarkable progress
8858095 who is the brilliant man that writes with such clarity beauty and sense who is this noble warrior that successfully propones the virtues of justice and chivalry
8858096 alright kittens are fucking awesome when theyre jumping around like theyre stalking prey in the wilds of the african savannah but when they jump on your lap when youre wanking to porn it is not cool
8858097 my excuse for this lax policy has been that playing should be judged by its harmonic quality and not its technical grandiosity however guys like yngwie are among my favorite guitarists and they use skill as a tool to better elucidate their musical message
8858098 it is worth preserving for future generations record of the sentiment recently betrayed by my ego at the thought of my behavior whilst interacting with people
8858099 i pictured the characteristics that are hallmarks of my social behavior often frenzied physical activity manic excitement at the most seemingly innocuous cue unsettingly passionate political posturing extreme kindness and compassion selflessness loyalty cool headedness in the face of disaster leadership manic humor occassional wit the merciless and unilateral invasion of physical space i felt intense and burning adulation and love for this wondrous and many talented individual then bam i realized it is i ross wigley
8858100 if i had been of age during the rhodesian war i would have been a foreign volunteer in service of the minority government
8858101 a perfect trifecta of variations on classical push ups pull chin ups and sit ups
8858102 my goal is to influence like minded individuals and help shape their perception of existence
8858103 such a ruling elite could lord over the masses with beneficence and understanding while wisely herding them towards the proper cause this is not beyond possibility
8858104 this has been the catalyst and causation of the beginning of the downfall of western civilization we are facing a g tterd mmerung in our history
8858105 this lead me to the brain in the vat theory at age 6 pretty kickass
8858106 my own beliefs cultured and shaped over about 12 years of mature sentient observation
8858107 more i realize the vast disparity between my beliefs and ideas and the average individuals
8858108 as i prepare to make my exodus to washington i am left with doubts even so i take little solace in the idea of extricating myself from this jungle
8858109 nothing is more repulsive and disgusting to me than seeing some fat bitch playing
8858110 nature chews up and spits out the foetid corpses of species that failed to survive
8858111 we all suffer the same for the sword take your suffering or die our liberal lifestyles are possible only because they were secured by the deaths of strong men who fought for our us in generations past possible only because we enslaved weaker cultures
8858112 the most talented players can fizzle out case in point darryl strawberry et al
8858113 the government is struggling to improve the quality of upe we are also trying to reduce the teacher student ratio but if the parents leave the burden of feeding children to us the government will be overwhelmed
8858114 when we were still at school our parents used to pack us cassava which we used to take to school i have just been to turkey where parents provide food to their children while at school
8858115 some bishops are very aggressive whereby schools are treated as purely for christians or catholics hence discouraging students with a different religion from joining them but government strives to stop sectarianism
8858116 the committee learnt with shock that the university runs 132 bank accounts although the auditor generals report had even put the figure higher than this and had recommended the closure of some of them
8858117 whereas the university explained that the accounts were approved by the council the committee was not satisfied with the way the bursar can effectively monitor them since some belong to individual departments or units within the university
8858118 the university has failed to harmonise and resolve the issue of salary enhancement which is resulting into repeated threats of strikes by the academic staff
8858119 i will encourage massive rebuilding of our educational system and creating special centres for skill acquisition
8858120 we have to become a little more flexible so that we dont reinvent the wheel in trying to realise the vision
8858121 if we had borrowed the art of writing 600 years ago we would not be where we are today because accumulated wisdom reduced into print enables one generation to grow faster
8858122 the destruction of public service in 1975 removed the institutional memory that will guarantee continuity
8858123 once the public service was destroyed by the retrenchment of more than 10 000 workers in 70s every body was floating
8858124 there was nobody afterwards to tell a minister that sir you cannot do that no checks and balances hence we have gone into corruption
8858125 if we had continued with the trajectory of growth of at least 10 per cent today per capita income will be at least 12 000
8858126 the face of nigeria will be different story when we talk about poverty
8858127 remind me to never go to a communist party they dont sound fun
8858128 after that 2004 fiesta bowl everybody knows who the university of utah is
8858129 certainly the university of utah is much more of a household name now
8858130 of course michigan is a well known big team across the nation
8858131 we respect them as an opponent but im not going to be intimidated by them just because theyre the university of michigan
8858132 i thought it was going to be a big towering structure but when we got there it was kind of underwhelming when it fills in its magnificent and they have an incredible program and tradition but in the end were all football players fighting for the same thing
8858133 there are a lot of veterans here and weve been in a lot of tough situations
8858134 we arent going to let a lot of people or a big stadium affect us

8858147 schon das sprichwort fordert uns auf den daumen zu pressen wenn wir jemand geneigt sind
8858148 if it werent for men we would still be in the stone ages the fact that women have the right to vote is outrageous i would never touch a woman cause they all contagious women so primitive they should be locked up behind cages 90 of women living off of hard working men while they watch oprah all day in the den ill rather be single for life before i make a money hungry woman my wife
8858149 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
8858150 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
8858151 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
8858152 i was just kind of a void i did seem to function all right but i was just kind of out of it
8858153 when you lose a son or daughter in a war theres a purpose to that but when you lose a son or daughter to a drunken driver theres no purpose to that
8858154 these are made of steel and the reason we chose steel is because of the way people die
8858155 theyre literally killed by a steel machine in fact weve done a lot of things here in steel for that very reason
8858156 it perpetually represents five years so every year its adjusted
8858157 someday we will have a place where children can play
8858158 we wont have any deaths by dwi someday thats going to happen
8858159 i couldve stopped with new mexico but i just kept thinking you know theres no reason why weve got the room why cant we just represent the whole nation
8858160 we arent aware of anything else that is on the same scale as what new mexico is doing
8858161 its such a great way to honor victims of drunk driving
8858162 id like to see the states join is send us any material that they would like for us to display to show on our videos to have available for the public that stops here i want this to become a center for dwi information and the states efforts against it

8858165 were getting supplies in and watching the storm very closely
8858166 we encourage families to make the arrangements as soon as possible
8858167 as we all experienced in the past communication of any sort during and immediately following a storm is a challenge
8858168 nursing home evacuation and even sheltering in place is a massive undertaking that requires great planning and organization on the part of the nursing home
8858169 as such you should not wait until this weekend to make decisions about a family member in a facility
8858170 weve been working closely with our state agencies in preparation said heritage manor spokeswoman mary arabie
8858171 were looking at our evacuation plan and making sure everything is in order
8858172 weve been in contact with our host facilities transportation services and families of residents
8858173 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8858174 growing up here has given me a lot to draw on
8858175 you do bad things when youre younger then get praised for reforming when youre older but you havent really changed at all
8858176 im a little nervous but at the same time i think its going to be very exciting
8858177 the show premiered over mothers day weekend its been a wonderful process and i think the fringe is a great way to showcase it
8858178 my audience is definitely mainstream american women but i think they can be really edgy
8858179 this is the way they really talk the way they talk when their husbands or kids arent around
8858180 every woman who feels like a crazy person i wish women told each other more about their little breakdowns and how inadequate they feel sometimes
8858181 i have three kids i literally walk around my house all day telling myself
8858182 something about jersey funny is universal we put our crazy out there
8858183 i turn it over to god and think theres nothing i can do about it and i also think what are the odds ive been flying for 18 years and had one emergency landing thats pretty good
8858184 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second
8858185 it was like in the movies when they land and you see all the fire trucks and emergency crews thats a real experience
8858186 i didnt have any anxiety like the last thing i want to do is get back on an airplane i did feel like the pilots and the flight attendants handled it perfectly
8858187 they were so very calm it wasnt a scary situation until afterward when you think about what possibly could have happened
8858188 there are regions affected by the storm that our teams have not been able to reach
8858189 the majority of victims died when their houses collapsed or were killed by falling trees others drowned when they tried to cross swollen rivers
8858190 the latest forecasts for tropical storm gustav suggest a slightly lower chance of major disruptions in oil production
8858191 whether we win or lose were going to be in the same position on the ladder so its more about us getting our processes right and certainly the style but more importantly we thought we turned the corner a little last week as far as form for some individuals and as a team wed like to keep that going
8858192 weve got a lot of respect for the adelaide football club they really are a good honest side who just work hard for each other and even if they werent playing for a home final you know youre going to get a great contest from them so its a great lead in for us for finals theres no doubt
8858193 i think in the belief factor were better i think after last seasons disappointment we had a fairly solid pre season and it was a matter of getting some wins on the board to cement some belief
8858194 there was a bit of anxiety amongst the group going in to round one but having a victory early i think was a catalyst for us to get a good roll on to the next seven or eight weeks
8858195 we want to see a response from last week with the way we went about our footy
8858196 we were very disappointed and we should be because the way we went about it after quarter time was so far away from the way we want to play the way we want to be perceived and our desired style of play
8858197 we need to correct that really quickly because it wont be anywhere near good enough in finals
8858198 said leslie pierce and catching her husbands eye began to laugh as he chimed in
8858199 they taught me how to carry myself the value of a firm handshake how to look someone in the eye when you speak to them
8858200 we had a roof over our head we each had a bed and we had clothes to wear to church every sunday
8858201 i remember white people standing on the corners spitting and foaming at the mouth
8858202 but most things that influenced you as a child you carry through life
8858203 we had just brought in groceries from the pantry pride on stenton avenue my mother was putting the bags on the counter when i heard the news
8858204 and i remember the skies lighting up on columbia avenue during the riots
8858205 and the day after he was shot i huddled in a corner at school i was afraid that something might happen to us
8858206 every single day ive always had to work at this level
8858207 ninety nine percent of the time i feel im guarding my color now this man this black man is getting ready to accept the nomination to be president of the united states if he coughs wrong theyre going to scrutinize every thing he does
8858208 you sit in class and hear about the ways blacks were treated you read about it and watch documentaries like eyes on the prize then you fast forward 45 years to today with a black man running for president and wonder is this the same country with the fire hoses and dogs attacking blacks who were taking a nonviolent approach to civil rights
8858209 but seeing where obama is shows that america has grown peoples minds are open to something new
8858210 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
8858211 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing
8858212 the market experienced a growth quarter on a sequential basis of 9
8858213 with three out of the six oems posting year over year revenue growth in the first half of 2008 in focal currencies we continue to believe that overall revenue growth for the industry may be more in the mid single digit range of 5 7 than flattish
8858214 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio
8858215 that hasnt eventuated and this has gone ahead without any further consultation with the unions since this decision was taken by the government yesterday and our members have just had it up to the neck with it

8858238 the two parties have been fighting but the fighting which occurred thursday morning was the most intense since the ceasefire was signed in january in fact there is a village called kanumbe that is where the two groups fought thursday morning the two parties are accusing each other of having launched the hostilities but up to now the situation is still unclear who begun the hostilities
8858239 monuc un mission in drc is expected to launch investigations and to establish the responsibility between the two belligerents

8858677 they think they can get away with the georgia issue it was very well calculated
8858678 we graciously accepted the postponement of the tournament which is a big setback to our cricket because players raised a hue and cry over the security but it seems as if these players just dont understand the problems being faced by us
8858679 we are trying to play cricket anywhere if we organise a tournament in pakistan india west indies and sri lanka will be available to tour as they said they had no issues on playing in pakistan
8858680 india is coming to play in pakistan in january and want their players to rest due to the postponement of the ct so india can be ruled out we will be playing west indies in a bilateral three match series in november in abu dhabi so inviting them was out of question
8858681 we still have sri lanka as an option but we have asked a couple of nations to invite us in writing
8858682 we have received favourable response from one of these nations and we are awaiting the response of their sponsors for a one day series it can be a bilateral series a tri nation or even a quadrangular we dont know but we are hopeful of getting cricket next month
8858683 cricket australia does not find it necessary to send a security outfit to india on a pre inspection visit whereas india has also had problems with terrorist attacks in recent times
8858684 i think even these players know they cant afford to offend the indians because all the money now is coming from india i would also love to see graeme smiths response if india were in talks with south africa to play a series next month instead of pakistan
8858685 but we want the betterment and promotion of cricket and we want to move forward but for that the other countries must cooperate with us

8858694 its all coming together and i think its better than any of us expected it to be
8858695 this is a building that will meet current demand as well as position us for future growth
8858696 when you look at the product at the end of the day its a very attractive building
8858697 i think its worth all the challenges we had to go through
8858698 were very excited about finally getting to this point weve known all along that davie county needed a new hospital the state agreed with us
8858699 the property weve purchased for this site obviously needs work done to prepare the site for construction and so we will begin immediately accessing where we are and how quickly we can get this project going
8858700 we cannot comment on the states decision for davie county because we have not received the specifics however we are on record as supporting a two hospital solution that will also allow us to continue to serve the more than 45 000 western forsyth and davie county residents who choose and trust forsyth medical center and our doctors for their care todays decision is not a two hospital solution and we plan to vigorously pursue our application for our medical center in clemmons
8858701 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8858702 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8858703 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8858704 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8858705 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8858706 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8858707 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8858708 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8858709 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8858710 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8858711 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8858712 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8858713 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8858714 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8858715 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8858716 chris smelley did come in and play very well well have to watch the tape analyze it to see what in the world happened to tommy
8858717 i went out there and gave it everything i had
8858718 id like to play next week its the thing ive been working for well see how it goes
8858719 basically a tough start the game was fine until the last series we fumbled the ball at the half the first series of the second half we let it get away from us
8858720 i thought we played ok its not time to start breaking out the champagne or anything
8858721 theres a group of us and we just stand outside and watch the water rise
8858722 if they could be elevated they would act less as a dam and the water could flow more readily and freely thats my non engineering background opinion
8858723 its in a mapped flood plain which when enough rain falls the flood plain is where the water is supposed to go
8858724 unfortunately a lot of houses in that area were built before accurate mapping
8858725 theres just too much water for that area and theres not a whole lot we can do for that from a structural point of view
8858726 the sale of alcohol is something our visitors to the county expect
8858727 where they gonna put the restaurants where they gonna put the motels
8858728 i see people pulling into that thing day in and day out people that are not from around this county to buy alcohol so thats one reason why im opposed to it
8858729 for example if beer sales were allowed within yadkin county last year it would have generated over a 100 000 purely by the population of the county
8858730 i want my children to be able to ride bicycles on the highways and things like that instead of me worrying about drunk drivers out here on the highway
8858731 they used their positions and their control over these agencies to commit those agencies to a transaction without the approval of the board of commissioners and the board of directors of these agencies and the reason they apparently did that was in order to gain
8858732 o messenger of allah not all of us possess the means whereby we can give a fasting person to break his fast
8858733 allah grants the same reward to the one who gives a fasting person to break the fast a mere date or a drink of water or a sip of milk for iftar
8858734 this is a month the first of which brings allahs mercy i e the first 10 days the middle of which brings his forgiveness and the last of which brings freedom from the fire of jahannum
8858735 whosoever lessens the burden of his servants or those under his authority in this month allah will forgive him and free him from the fire of jahannum
8858736 and in this month four things you should continue to perform in great number two of which shall be to please your lord while the other two shall be those without which you cannot do those which shall be to please your lord are that you should in great quantity bear witness that there is no deity to worship except allah i e recite the kallimah tayyibah laa ilaha illallah and make much istighfaar repentance beg allahs forgiveness with astagfirullah and as for those without which you cannot do you should beg of allah entrance into paradise and ask refuge in him from jahannum
8858737 and whoever gave a person who fasted water to drink allah shall grant that giver to drink from my fountain such a drink where after that a person shall never again feel thirsty until he enters jannah
8858738 the populations that bear the greatest burden nationally blacks for example and men who have sex with men are highly represented in new york city
8858739 because hiv is more prevalent within those groups the risk of hiv infection per sexual contact is higher
8858740 its typical of the government where they have gone berserk with this sort of stuff
8858741 its not a feminist takeover its a lesbian takeover in wellington
8858742 theres hardly a government head thats not a lesbian so many lesbians are in top jobs and they dont want to acknowledge any sex its a neutralisation of sex instead of saying foreman or forewoman
8858743 my heart goes out to phyllis lyon for the loss of del martin her soul mate and beloved wife with whom she shared her life for 55 years
8858744 along with phyllis del was a courageous civil rights pioneer from co founding the first lesbian rights organization and publishing the first lesbian newsletter to being among the first in california to legally marry her same sex partner del has been at the forefront of our movement
8858745 she helped to lay the groundwork for much of the progress we have enjoyed and the impact of her visionary leadership will continue
8858746 ill personally always be grateful to del and phyllis for being there for me and for countless other lesbians
8858747 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me
8858748 i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8858749 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8858750 actually it was started by my researcher ian reichbach because my grandmother has more internet savvy than i do and shes been dead for 33 years
8858751 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8858752 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8858753 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8858754 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8858755 it was like a chimney around me and i was burning alive
8858756 the flames kept burning me like a roasting marshmallow in a fire it hurt so bad
8858757 ive worked so hard ive gone through so many surgeries because i thought theyd give me my job back
8858758 they promised me they were my knights in shining armor
8858759 when the doorbell rang i just knew what it was
8858760 given the nature and extent of your injuries it is clear that you are unable to perform the duties required in that position
8858761 adversely affected because south africa produces huge quantities of chicken with the launching of free trade zone i do not think we will be in business for very long especially small producers who borrowed funds from ceda
8858762 for us to compete with these south african producers we need to grow first it is only last year that the government passed legislation for abattoirs and allied industries it is barely a year since the act was passed how can we be ready to compete we do not have the experience
8858763 labour is also a problem here because poultry farming is not a popular occupation
8858764 we do not know whether wheat flour is included but i know that certain products are not the department of trade will have to inform us first before we can make an informed comment
8858765 wheat flour has a 15 percent levy on it although it has been very ineffective we had concerns about the ineffectiveness of this protection because it was not being properly policed
8858766 it is only last year that a law on abattoirs was passed
8858767 what it means is that the rest of the facilities that were used by pig farmers for slaughtering will have been rendered illegal by the new law and farmers who fail to meet the new requirements for slaughterhouses will have to close their businesses
8858768 my production cost was p19 per kg and the super markets were only willing to buy at p16 50 per kg
8858769 unless south african companies use unfair means we should continue to have an advantage over them
8858770 the government is not going to remove the existing import duty immediately it will be removed over time it will take time to reduce duties for the simple reason that this is a strategic industry we are currently protected
8858771 tariffs will be gradually reduced we have sensitive industries like the beef industry the dairy industry and the milling industry sensitive industries are a sector that a country sees as very important for industrialisation economic growth and poverty reduction
8858772 i am satisfied that the accused received money and he did not remit it as instructed in the premises i convict the accused
8858773 the offence of embezzlement is serious and rampant i seek a deterrent sentence

8858785 the philippines has a lower incidence of hiv than most of its neighbors despite sharing many of the risks but health officials warned on thursday that many new cases were now coming to light
8858786 meaning that less than 0 1 percent of the population and less than 5 0 percent of people in high risk groups were infected
8858787 was despite the low usage of condoms in the catholic majority country
8858788 in the philippines the low partner exchange the frequency or the number of male clients of prostitutes frequenting other partners the contributory factor of circumcision those are some of the conditions that have somehow kept the hiv prevalence low
8858789 but what were saying is it does mask the threat because it might not reveal the changes in the way hiv is spreading

8858793 a strong iraq and an economically strong government is probably the best antidote to iranian involvement in iraq
8858794 there is a wide array of steps that have to be taken here to make sure that the taliban does not grab hold and al qaida is diminished
8858795 senator obama will not hesitate as good friends do with each other to speak directly about concerns americans have about the direction china might take that we think might not be in the interests of freedom and the rights of human beings
8858796 completely wrong inappropriate and not in the interest of russia as a responsible player in the international community
8858797 evaluate this relationship day by day depending on russias behavior there is no question there are many things we have to work closely with russia on
8858798 but even in that context senator obama has been very clear that we have to evaluate this relationship
8858799 is very crucial not only to stopping drug wars but to stopping civil wars

8858811 indeed i know that this is so but how can a mortal be just before god
8858812 god will not turn back his anger the helpers of rahab bowed beneath him how then can i answer him choosing my words with him though i am innocent i cannot answer him i must appeal for mercy to my accuser for he is not a mortal as i am that i might answer him that we should come to trial together there is no umpire between us who might lay his hand on us both if he would take his rod away from me and not let dread of him terrify me then i would speak without fear of him for i know i am not what i am thought to be
8858813 i truly understand that god shows no partiality but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him you know the message he sent to the people of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all that message spread throughout judea beginning in galilee after the baptism that john announced how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and with power how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for god was with him we are witnesses to all that he did both in judea and in jerusalem they put him to death by hanging him on a tree but god raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear not to all the people but to us who were chosen by god as witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one ordained by god as judge of the living and the dead all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name

8858835 for there to be increased adoption of open source databases at the enterprise application tier a number of factors need to be addressed
8858836 these include increased enterprise functionality improved service and support offering proof that performance fears are misplaced increased resistance traditional database software licensing and a move to web based architecture for internal applications

8858964 republican mismanagement has really hit home around the kitchen table
8858965 at kitchen tables across ohio and the heartland mothers and fathers are worried

8858967 i take the train home to wilmington sometimes very late as i look out the window at the homes we pass i can almost hear what theyre talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed
8858968 its a wonderful image its an image that stays with you because it mirrors reality
8858969 the symbol of all things practical and all things comforting
8858970 you dont invite the stranger into the kitchen unless you really like them the living room is preserved for that
8858971 many people dont make as formal meals anymore so the kitchen table becomes a place where a lot does happen
8858972 if youre not in the kitchen youre going to miss out
8858973 the kitchen itself is really becoming a living room in american homes
8858974 you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8858975 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell

8858978 where the early adopters and the discretionary spenders were leading the charge now as we go into the 30 per cent range for planned purchases the change to apple looks permanent what we have in the end actually were sort of there now is that buying an apple is as normal as buying a dell or an hp computer in america
8858979 you want to see what a halo effect looks like take a look at last year
8858980 this years halo isnt to the degree of last years but in this economic environment and the fact that apples hitting its biggest numbers ever means its enough to see apple significantly outperform expectations going forward
8858981 everything else equal apples outperforming in an incredibly difficult consumer spending environment

8858991 junto a alguns bons amigos e diversos m sicos de excelente qualidade
8858992 aquele que tem os meus mandamentos e os guarda esse o que me ama
8858993 a soldier up in the towers thats our first line of defense
8858994 among their myriad duties include the responsibility for clearing the marksmanship range in addition to assessing and responding to safety and security issues on the fob
8858995 the majority of the soldiers have been doing pretty good
8858996 they remain pretty active as far as scanning their areas and calling things up due to the location
8858997 the tower guards are the soldiers out on the line making sure there are no possible threats to the fob making sure no one jumps over the walls tracking to make sure there are no attacks
8858998 they are the first line of defense against threats such as the improvised rocket assisted munitions
8858999 we also conduct visual inspections to make sure the soldiers are in the proper uniform and make sure they are ready to do their job 100 percent 24 hours per day seven days per week
8859000 we built new weapons mounts from scratch to provide a secure platform for the crew serve weapons in the towers
8859001 we worked for nearly two months building rocket propelled grenades baskets metal frames with hesco basket wiring and sandbags to provide additional protection to the soldiers in the towers
8859002 my work observing the radar can potentially save lives if i am not doing my job somebody could die
8859003 every unit has a different standard and right now our biggest challenge is soldiers coming out of their uniforms
8859004 the thing we learned from this summer was we dont know a thing
8859005 the lesson was you dont need guys to make money on a movie
8859006 you can make movies that are a little nichier and still do remarkably well
8859007 it looked like a video game in the tv commercials a blitz of colors and not much else
8859008 you really had to see the movie to get it unfortunately not that many people did
8859009 was it a sex comedy was it a sports comedy it had a very confused marketing campaign
8859010 x files proves just because something was on tv once doesnt mean it makes sense as a movie
8859011 some people will say that this is just a cover for the same liberal etc
8859012 they were joking with me at work calling me joe the hero but i was just in the right place at the right time
8859013 three other gentlemen took off chasing him and i was walking in that same direction suddenly the guy made a u turn and came back toward me i grabbed him
8859014 he was clawing at me and i have a nice bruise on the side of my face where he threw an elbow at my head
8859015 instead of awarding money based on title we began to award money based on impact on individual student achievement
8859016 usually on an effort like this the first go round normally gets divided equally based on the number of positions
8859017 its less controversial it builds a better sense of harmony and its safer for all involved
8859018 im always going to remember being a little part of this
8859019 i care about the speech but im probably not going to remember most of what he says standing up here waving the flag talking to everybody around us in the stands all of that makes you feel like a part of something
8859020 i never thought id see a night like this in my lifetime
8859021 i mean a part of me still cant believe were here at something as big as this
8859022 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8859023 i was anti obama before i came in here but now im willing to sign a contract right now saying ill vote for him
8859024 he hit every point from tax cuts for the middle class to energy conservation he could really lead he has a real game plan for america i stared at the tv the whole time without blinking once
8859025 he seemed right on target with the problems of america with what im going through right now
8859026 right now im leaning toward mccain but im going to wait until after the debates
8859027 barack hasnt given me that slam dunk smoking gun that would get me to vote for him
8859028 everything he was talking about were things im seeing with my friends and people i work with every day
8859029 i saw smoke and flames gush up through the house
8859030 theyre calmer now but they dont know that their little brother had died
8859031 when you expressed interest in adopting prince chunk your family was aware of the special circumstances surrounding him
8859032 it was agreed that the adoption contract would be drafted by legal councel sic
8859033 we hope you will continue to serve as the foster family
8859034 if however at any time you are unwilling to foster him i am prepared to find prince chunk another foster home should you need us to do so
8859035 it was an incredible experience to live through and to be listening to obama today it gives hope to the possibility that america can do the right thing and rise above race and creed
8859036 to look at this man not as a black man but as a man who is capable to lead the country and to bring about the change we need at this time
8859037 our investigation revealed that new york city is rife with gas stations that engage in deceptive practices where they display one price as a way to lure customers and then charge them more at the pump
8859038 new yorkers forced to pay top dollar for gas this summer deserve truthful advertising not false come ons
8859039 this country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich
8859040 instead it is that american spirit that american promise that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend
8859041 but we refuse to believe the bank of justice is bankrupt
8859042 we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation
8859043 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8859044 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
8859045 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8859046 the scheme tilted the playing field to the advantage of favored investors at the expense of the investing public
8859047 has offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love
8859048 if he ran for mayor or even thought about it hed be an instant favorite
8859049 i dont think andrew wants to do that i think he likes what hes doing now
8859050 we want to take every precaution in order to ensure everyones safety
8859051 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8859052 this is certainly a part of a fulfillment of the dream of my father
8859053 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family
8859054 they could have been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred
8859055 what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8859056 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8859057 most conventions historically produce a bounce just the focused media attention on one side and none on the other produces a bounce
8859058 when it doesnt occur thats really the thing to make note of
8859059 they looked like they had their act together the clintons being key players
8859060 i kind of believe for the most part they have a marginal impact
8859061 al gore got a big bump at his convention in the polls and it dissipated
8859062 this is advantage obama its one on one getting beyond the rhetoric to getting to the second and third pages of substance where he stumbles and thats going to be the rest of the campaign
8859063 i keep thinking did the army corps of engineers fix the levees
8859064 im scared i cried last night and this morning when i packed up my suitcase
8859065 im not going to take another chance ever again with my life
8859066 i was talking to my friends last night and i told them i havent paid off my credit cards from katrina
8859067 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8859068 hell no im getting the hell out of here asap
8859069 i cant go through what i went through with katrina
8859070 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8859071 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8859072 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8859073 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8859074 this guys an ace he takes every precaution to make sure everythings aboveboard
8859075 there is no way john would have allowed that girl on the water i think the family hired a private instructor and rented a boat
8859076 its nothing out of the ordinary for us she didnt do anything wrong
8859077 its so sad alexandra was always happy always smiling she was such a beautiful girl
8859078 its a lot of sprinting and standing both of which are hard for me
8859079 theres a lot of throwing which involves more hand eye coordination than im used to
8859080 a lot of these prosthetic feet arent designed for standing or for quick acceleration
8859081 has never been a limiting factor for me ive had it all my life so im used to it but its a challenge still
8859082 when i ride the 7 train here every morning people stop to talk to me about the us open and my work as a ball person they give me really good feedback and say im an inspiration
8859083 im sure he is because the court just awarded me oh i cant talk about it
8859084 this is a robbery i am armed and dangerous dont be stupid i want money
8859085 he let people know that he was just as red white and blue as john mccain is
8859086 i never thought i would see it in my lifetime and ive never been more proud of my country
8859087 i like that he looked at the camera and said i want to talk you about some of these issues
8859088 that he talked about getting money for early education and paying teachers more
8859089 if americas not ready to have a black president then its a very sad day for the united states

8859094 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army

8859106 al quran adalah khazanah ilmu allah swt sumber hukum tuhan memuat nasib umat terdahulu sekarang dan akan datang memuat rahasia kematian dan kiamat serta terdiri dari ayat muhkam jelas dan mutsyabih perlu penafsiran quran adalah neraca keadilan dan mempunyai dua tujuan ketika diturunkan tujuan pertama upaya penyadaran dan pendidikan serta pensucian manusia dan akhirnya menunjukkan mereka jalan kesempurnaan tujuan kedua membentuk masyarakat adil dalam upaya menggapai kehidupan yang bahagia dua tujuan ini adalah tujuan tertinggi al quran atau lebih tepatnya shirat al mustaqim

8859108 membaca dan menghafal al quran memberikan ketenangan tersendiri bagi manusia seakan akan dia merasa bahwa al quran adalah penolong dan temannya
8859109 di negara lain sulit ditemukan semangat yang ditunjukkan oleh warga iran
8859110 al quran adalah penerus wujud rasulullah saw sepanjang sejarah kita saksikan posisi al quran di kalangan masyarakat islam seperti posisi nabi saww itu sendiri dan kecintaan muslimin kepada al quran sama seperti kecintaan mereka terhadap nabi saww sebagaimana nabi saww sebagai simbol persatuan di tengah tengah muslimin al quran juga sebagai simbol dan sumber persatuan khususnya dewasa ini dimana musuh musuh islam membidik persatuan islam karena khawatir akan kebangkitan islam
8859111 al quran adalah ibarat sebuah cermin yang memungkinkan kita melihat potret islam sebenarnya al quran juga sebuah neraca untuk menghindari ekstrimisme asas mayarakat islami yang ideal harus dicari di al quran semua ide sebagimana pun adilnya jika tidak berasaskan al quran akan terjadi penyelewengan dan akhirnya al quran adalah pedoman hidup

8859124 we dont really know why the bottle failed and thats the key question for the investigation
8859125 sustained a failure that allowed a sudden and complete release of the pressurized contents
8859126 the preliminary report was a factual account of the incident and investigation to date
8859127 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8859128 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8859129 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8859130 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8859131 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8859132 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8859133 serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression
8859134 i mean ive been able to do that since i was in the minor leagues
8859135 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game
8859136 our guys ill tell you they stay at it they stay at it for nine innings
8859137 fontenot go out there and get us going he hit a homer and all of a sudden its a two run game and we got the top of our lineup coming soriano got on base and theriot got on base we got a good team
8859138 we shouldnt be going through this this is our time to hold these leads and its our job were not getting it done right now
8859139 yeah to think about how well cole threw the ball and how well our guys put at bats up against dempster its a tough one

8859142 it is not at all clear what the syrians want
8859143 they say that above all they want american involvement in the talks with israel but then they side clearly with the russians during a time of great tension with the us and nato
8859144 the refugees should have the right of return to their homeland and we are negotiating this with the israelis i have to say we are not agreeing with permanent settlement of palestinian refugees in lebanon we are against permanent resettlement
8859145 indonesia is great country and specially the nature of forest
8859146 there is one leadership team in trouble and that is morris at the moment and that is morris iemma
8859147 mr ofarrell is in leadership quicksand and it is quite clear that the member for manly is lining up
8859148 the money that has already been collected needs to be quarantined it needs to be locked away from mr rudd and mr swan and administered independently by a board which can fully fund and support alcohol education and treatment and rehabilitation programs
8859149 why do you think the distillery companies have been jumping up and down so much about this
8859150 the government does have a duty to ensure that councils who have been severely and drastically affected by the forced amalgamation agenda are properly financially compensated for it
8859151 i didnt know that i would ever see the day
8859152 not one person in that office ever had to take a test

8859158 many of the schools and districts on this years improvement list have met tough challenges and have made strong improvements
8859159 i want parents and other members of our communities to know that they should look far beyond a schools ayp status to determine the real quality of education that is being delivered there
8859160 our federal government needs to get real be fair support our schools and pay for the recommendations they require
8859161 with new leadership at the school our scores rose significantly this year
8859162 im very pleased with their progress but it wasnt quite enough to make ayp
8859163 i continue to be very proud of the work of our staff on behalf of all students
8859164 we have been and will continue to be focused on the success of all children with fewer resources our staff and students continue to outperform those districts with more resources
8859165 statewide results are not surprising considering the double digit increases in achievement requirements
8859166 changes need to be made to the system to better assist schools and districts in meeting nclb requirements
8859167 we are aggressively working to improve instruction and assessment to positively impact student achievement especially in math and reading
8859168 nclb is federal law and well continue to pursue the standards set by 2014
8859169 our community expects that of us and we expect that of ourselves

8859173 den wm titel mit einem so gro en r ckstand zu jagen ist vielleicht bei einem anderen fahrer m glich aber mit valentino ist es nahezu unm glich
8859174 es sind noch sechs rennen zu fahren wir haben einen gro en r ckstand auf valentino in der wm also m ssen wir jetzt die rmel hochkrempeln
8859175 anzunehmen dass er alle sechs rennen gewinnt ist nicht vermessen
8859176 seit casey die neue ausbaustufe des motorrads hat hat er drei von f nf rennen gewonnen einmal war er zweiter und das andere mal lag er in f hrung insofern glaube ich dass er das potenzial hat alle noch ausstehenden rennen zu gewinnen
8859177 das ist caseys wahres potenzial anzunehmen dass er alle sechs rennen gewinnt ist nicht vermessen
8859178 im moment gibt es niemanden der zwischen casey und valentino hineinsto en kann wenn man sich anschaut was die beiden gerade auff hren dann ist das f r alle anderen fast schon peinlich
8859179 ich liege lieber 50 punkte vorne als 25 oder 50 hinten
8859180 kann in den n chsten sechs rennen jedem anderen auch passieren es ist also noch lange nicht geschafft andererseits liege ich lieber 50 punkte vorne als 25 oder 50 hinten
8859181 es ist etwas ganz besonderes hier zu sein weil ich so nahe an meiner heimat bin nat rlich gibt das zus tzlichen druck
8859182 ich hatte diesmal viel mehr ticketanfragen im vergleich zum vorjahr in misano denn diesmal ist die situation in der wm viel besser f r mich hoffentlich kann ich meinen fans eine tolle show bieten
8859183 in diesem jahr kommen wir in guter form hier an und haben bei den letzten rennen einen tollen speed gezeigt wir hatten einen guten test in br nn bei dem wir das bike verbessert haben unser ziel ist es dieses hohe level in den kommenden rennen zu halten
8859184 das letzte jahr war eine gro e entt uschung wir haben hart gearbeitet und alles gegeben im training lief es auch gut wir ben tigten ein gutes ergebnis ein podium ich startete aus der ersten reihe und hatte zu beginn eine gute pace aber nach drei runden ging mein motor aus es war eine der schwierigsten zeiten meiner karriere in diesem jahr m ssen wir es besser machen

8859197 espanyol have decided taking into account the player must leave next sunday to join up with his national team to authorise the player to travel to manchester to take a medical this friday while the english club deals with the documentation of the termination of the argentinian contract with the catalan team
8859198 until this moment espanyol have tried to convince zabaleta to continue in barcelona but the defender has shown his determination to continue his career in the premier league
8859199 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly

8859201 its a great opportunity for the players the club and our sponsors gazprom to be seen at the highest level against one of the best teams in the world with the whole world watching
8859202 from the moment we beat rangers a lot of things happened to the club

8859209 when we have our body and mind in order everything else will exist in the right place in the right way but usually without being aware of it we try to change something other than ourselves we try to order things outside us but it is impossible to organize things if you yourself are not in order when you do things in the right way at the right time everything else will be organized

8859222 we designed this plan to start in winter so we would get a critical mass of people understanding it
8859223 but its been fair to say the last two weeks have been some of the coldest nights in manly im really keen to have a nice warm summers night to test it out
8859224 there were a couple of hot nights when i first came in march so i appreciate what its like in summer
8859225 there are still some things that need tidying up such as the taxis but so far its working well having the food people close half an hour after the pubs close is working well people are having some food and settling down
8859226 awareness of the early closures is still down but thats the reason we started it in winter
8859227 we want to gradually get people out in the corso and understanding the early closures
8859228 people who are coming down on the weekend are discussing it with me quite passionately and theyre certainly aware of it
8859229 i was working full time as a posty and playing reserve grade
8859230 five years behind jt jason taylor at north sydney was tough
8859231 i sat down with bob saunders and i said look i dont see myself getting a start at this club i might have to go look elsewhere
8859232 he told me youve worked so hard keep working hard and you just never know
8859233 he told me ex eagles coach peter sharp had a big opinion of me and i was on the verge of getting a start
8859234 its a hard slog to be a reserve grader for that long
8859235 i was like a chook without a head we got beat and everything went really fast
8859236 i worked night shifts then so i was finished later in the afternoon and went to work that night i did that for a half a season thats all i could deal with then
8859237 during the trial the court heard ms fleming praise northern beaches police especially det sgt andrew marks of the state crime commands homicide squad and crown prosecutor margaret cunneen sc for their
8859238 he also accepts the pain and anguish the fleming family has suffered
8859239 the accused obviously regrets that there was an incident he regrets that there was a death
8859240 there has not been a day gone by when he has not thought about it its a tragedy from start to finish
8859241 why not erect signs like no raping to add to the no drink spiking and no urinating in public manly tourism at its finest
8859242 this adds to their already uninviting erected signs throughout manly oh and dont forget about the twin no jumping signs erected at the end of the storm water drains on manly beach
8859243 i also think they need to respect councils duty to protect public safety
8859244 we would rather not have to put signs up and would rather people take personal responsibility and not do dangerous things
8859245 we have to make the judgment call as unpopular as it may be and unpallatable it is for council but sometimes we have no choice
8859246 i was coming in to bowl with the first ball of a game 18 months ago and i almost broke my ankle as i stepped on to the uneven pitch
8859247 that was when i decided that to get something done about the condition of our sports fields i needed to get involved in local government

8859253 one of the difficulties of getting staff on the northern beaches is that people work outside the peninsula and it is hard for people living in the western suburbs to get to
8859254 the certificate three is a one year course while the nursing qualification is three years we need experienced staff as well of course we cant staff the whole centre with people straight out of school but we are looking for about one in five of our staff at warriewood to be school leavers
8859255 im totally opposed to the development of lizard rock because its bushland with an extremely high value and its home to so many plants that arent found elsewhere
8859256 the same problem confronts the middle harbour catchment with the plan to develop the bushland above bantry bay and duffys forest is also under threat
8859257 ideally we want to put people together in centres with higher densities where public transport already exists and take the pressure off the constant sprawling of development into the bushland

8859262 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things and you know what its worked before because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government when washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty if your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know i get it
8859263 we need a government that cares more about barney smith than smith barney
8859264 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8859265 youre certainly dealing with the reality that theres no way were going to be able to catch the angels so we just wanted to come out and win a ball game
8859266 ive got to tip my hat to the boys they did some damage there in the eighth
8859267 there is no more important mission anywhere than maintaining the readiness safety and security of our nuclear weapons we are fully committed to demonstrating to the american people we deserve their trust to do that mission
8859268 each violation of our very exacting standards is fully investigated and every person at all levels is held fully accountable for their actions
8859269 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
8859270 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8859271 they couldve heard words of anger and discord they couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred but what the people heard instead people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8859272 brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
8859273 it is that promise that has always set this country apart that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one american family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well
8859274 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million dollars a year
8859275 how else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million americans how else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits
8859276 i know barack obamas going to set this country on fire
8859277 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8859278 the group has performed well in difficult market conditions this reflects our focus on robust business models which emphasise the benefit of repeat income streams the underlying rate of profit growth was 12 per cent which was off set by the movement in sterling
8859279 if they are just carrying a few palestinians that is not a problem
8859280 its something that in my lifetime i never thought i would see someone in our race become president or attempt to become president
8859281 no black man i would have ever believed would be doing what he is doing now i hope to live to see
8859282 its very important because we have an african american man running we need that change
8859283 we will remember this no matter where we were at the time that this speech was being made
8859284 i stopped my music so these people would hear this man and understand what he is bringing to the table
8859285 we finally might get a good sheriff instead of talking about having bill clinton as the first black president
8859286 we are finally going to get our black president i think the brother can get the job done
8859287 i think its one of the greatest things that has ever happened to us in awhile
8859288 now all children can see they can be whatever they want to be
8859289 weve always told them they can be whatever they want to be now they can see it
8859290 brothers please come and surround our leaders to prevent the police from getting them
8859291 the end is what got me you know its a dream and its going to come true we gotta work for it
8859292 i like when you put that voice on it makes me feel like im sleeping with two men ive gotta have both of you tonight
8859293 boombastic is driving me ballistic this record isnt even worth the vinyl its been printed on
8859294 i remember the very first time i heard this it was just incredible
8859295 what the hell did i do to this guy why is he watching me like a hawk every night
8859296 i need to talk to you i seen em come and i seen em go but i tell you somethin and this is the truth i watch you out there youre good
8859297 when hes 90 years old and moonwalking at one mile per hour the world will be there to watch
8859298 im one of the loneliest people in the world and releases the moonwalker film a mixed bag of music videos and child like fantasy sequences
8859299 thats the most loving thing to do to share your bed with someone
8859300 there has been interest from other clubs i have known him for a few years now he is a decent player who will add to the balance down the left hand side he has a decent left foot and has a good chance of starting this weekend
8859301 he went on loan to leyton orient and did quite well and when he became available a couple of weeks ago it was something i put to the chairman obviously we have to balance the books and you have to get people out to get others in but again the chairman has backed me to the hilt
8859302 we have got a good deal from spurs and we are pleased so hopefully come saturday we will see
8859303 musik r ingenting isolerat fr n livet fr n det vi erfar upplever och ser

8859305 we take a lot of pride in how hard the team works in the preseason
8859306 were allowed two weeks by the ncaa and for those two weeks theres lots of hard work and the pay off has been a successful result of all that hard work
8859307 its especially tough because we didnt play them last year and its their opener so we have no scouting reports or film on them
8859308 we need to focus on what we need to do if we want to win we have to showcase our talent this game is really all about connecticut field hockey
8859309 we were playing to win not to just give players time on the field durham was the 2006 english collegiate champion and runner up in 2007
8859310 this puts is in a good position we have 16 to 18 players that can help us win we are using that depth as an advantage having fresh legs on the field is always an advantage
8859311 we definitely need to generate more shots its simple mathematics
8859312 if you generate more shots you have more chances to score this is going to be a focus for us in the upcoming game
8859313 having an all american at that center mid position is essential
8859314 jen kleinhans can really dominate a game in the midfield the center mid in soccer or field hockey is like the quarterback and she plays that role really well
8859315 hes a different back than he was during the season
8859316 hes hungry hes got a chip on his shoulder hes very focused on what he wants to accomplish to help our team
8859317 we cant throw three interceptions we cant get down in the red zone and not come away with points in those situations
8859318 three interceptions one interception two interceptions however many its unacceptable
8859319 its my job to take care of the football next week thats going to be all my focus
8859320 i text everybody to tell them to come here i say meet up at the u and when i say u i mean this place
8859321 this year no team in the conference stands out as being able to be dominant
8859322 as a team we have to believe we can beat anyone and if we combine that belief with hard work we will be tough to beat
8859323 combining our versatility with the speed of this offense will give us a great chance to be at the top of the big east conference
8859324 i hope and plan to contribute in the same way i have been for the past two years with my passing and defensive ability but i also plan to be an offensive threat from the outside
8859325 we hope to have solid passing which will lead to an exciting and fast offense
8859326 now that ive been out there im just more anxious to get out there and help my team again to another win
8859327 its been a long time since ive been able to say ive had fun on the field
8859328 sometimes it feels like im more of a track guy than a football player but ive been doing football since i was 9 years old football is my first love and im going to keep going at it until i cant go any more
8859329 theyll be up for us this will be a tough match opening night isnt going to be an easy one but we want to be challenged
8859330 we need another week but were not going to get it hopefully well be ready by seven on friday night
8859331 guys are sore guys are tired guys have been knocked up a little bit
8859332 i think we have pieces but its going to take some time when we came back in january after being off six weeks it took a month to get these guys playing up to the speed they were playing a month earlier
8859333 we won the game but we have to be able to do things better
8859334 i dont care if its the first game of the year or the 10th game of the year that shouldnt happen
8859335 the offensive line and the wide receivers did a great job blocking and made my night a whole lot easier
8859336 you can see hes got the shiftiness and the speed back he maybe didnt have a year ago
8859337 hes a guy whos going to make some thing happen
8859338 with a slight fear of being tackled by police i hopped on the highest counter i could see and shouted out the news
8859339 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8859340 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8859341 ive always been able to drive in runs its something im proud of and i like to be in that situation late in the game

8859427 country ke liye kuch karana hain i keep thinking that i have to do something it all started when i was in my 11th standard i was asked if i could write the exam for a physically challenged boy at symbiosis i knew it was tough but i agreed i wrote his exam he passed and got 65 percent that made me realise that me doing a small thing could have a great impact the next year i used my entire vacation to pursue social activities
8859428 i dont score very badly i do spend very little time in college but then ive also become more passionate about studying harder
8859429 but i havent got many volunteers ill keep trying though
8859430 i am sensitive towards beggars street children and the handicapped i had decided for myself that i would participate actively for the betterment of this class when i start earning at the start of my professional life i donated and tried to work for famed organisations like
8859431 catalyst our ngo aims at bridging this divide in delhi we get upwardly mobile youth and professionals to interact with the underprivileged we organise programmes and activities with the two groups
8859432 i was just 18 years old while flying a kite on the terrace my brother spotted an injured pigeon it was being attacked by crows so we took it home we tried to save it but it died the apathy of the pigeon led me start an ngo
8859433 my volunteering definitely gives me better visibility in my friend circle and among networking sites at work my colleagues understand and respect the cause trying to help in any way they can
8859434 i volunteer because i am interested in doing social work
8859435 i want to do an mba qualify professionally basically i will also give the upsc government service examination

8859437 at times it is difficult to maintain a balance between work this activity and my personal life but when i see joy on the innocent faces of the orphans at ishwarpuram it makes me forget everything
8859438 its difficult to get people to visit the underprivileged they usually dont come but when they do they are there to stay once they attend a session their perspective changes
8859439 the outlook of the upwardly mobile towards the underprivileged and the poor changes
8859440 i have received more than rs 1 5 lakhs in donations from my friends in india and the united states for ishwarpuram currently we have 45 children we want to extend this number to 100 we also plan to support female children mentally and physically handicapped children and elderly people in short we want to have ishwarpuram as a home for any underprivileged person

8859553 its always a pleasure at craic week and to welcome so many friends from all over the world to ireland
8859554 usually there is only one arse on the main on that boat
8859555 weve had a good regatta despite letting carmen slip through on race one of the second day we took the wrong side and she slipped through
8859556 but we didnt make the same mistake in the second and covered carmen throughout
8859557 the light conditions which weve had all weekend have really suited us and theres been good teamwork and tactics on board
8859558 i think our next big regatta is likely to be west highland yachting week so well look forward to that
8859559 its tempting to get involved with matchracing when you have two identical boats leading but you have to keep watching whats going on elsewhere
8859560 we had a great scottish series carmen won irc3 but this only our second season weve got new sails and the teamwork is getting better all the time
8859561 we were over the line at the start of the second race which the crew got rather excited about but we just had to go back and get on with it managed to move up the fleet from the back though and we got a second for that race in the end
8859562 tanit loves these conditions about 8 14 knots so it was just perfect for us the boats four years old and this is our best result so far
8859563 we were the first of the traditional big boats and im very happy with that
8859564 we were last at scottish series but weve had great fun here
8859565 we took line honours in all of the five races which too be honest we should have done we led from start to finish in the first of day twos races winning by enough to give us a first on corrected time in the second we had stretched another good lead but the breeze strengthened and brought the rest of the fleet in closer behind us
8859566 its very different to the radial especially communicating with nine other people on the boat rather than just me
8859567 we cant find anything more but floating debris thats why this morning friday we declared that there are no more survivors

8859573 patients who used statins before an ami and continued to take them after were 16 less likely to die over the next year than those who never used them so even if it appears that the statins failed to prevent your ami it is beneficial to continue taking them and potentially quite harmful to stop
8859574 in the general population the statin discontinuation rate within the first year of prescription is 30 percent thats very high
8859575 because statins are preventative drugs patients may not feel the immediate benefit of taking them and sometimes stop however it looks like this might be quite a dangerous practice after an ami
8859576 regardless of the mechanism or explanation physicians should be careful when assessing each patients medication needs
8859577 patients also need to take their medications exactly as prescribed after an ami statins in particular should only be withdrawn after an ami under close clinical supervision

8859592 its history but we can take this and apply what weve learned here today to the conflicts were facing today
8859593 there are some examples of how they had to deal with not necessarily knowing who the enemy is
8859594 not all the indians were enemies many of them were friendly to them you go over to iraq and its the exact same scenario
8859595 that was just a course on the pacific northwest and we didnt really go over this too much

8859609 blackburn being a massive club and a premier league club was a chance that i couldnt really let go i did everything in my power to get here i was pleading with the chairman at mk dons to get the deal done and the chance to work with the gaffer once again was obviously a key factor
8859610 coming here is a fantastic opportunity for me and it is one that i am really relishing and i hope to take with both hands
8859611 my aims are to play as many games as possible but i know it is going to be hard to break into the team because theyve had a very good start
8859612 so im under no illusions it is going to be a very hard test for me to get into the team but it is one that i am relishing and very much looking forward to

8859621 he was very consistent for us last year and has started this season well for for us

8859639 ik probeerde iets te herkennen maar zag niets die lange grijze baard dat gedraaide knotje op zijn hoofd ik kon niet geloven dat deze alternatieve genezer het alter ego van radovan karadzic was
8859640 als je niet zou weten waar hij verantwoordelijk voor is zou je hem aardig vinden
8859641 ik was er ooggetuige van dat italiaanse vredestroepen bij een controlepost met hun rug naar een servisch konvooi gingen staan dat radovan karadzic begeleidde
8859642 dat was dertien jaar geleden gelukkig is hij deze zomer gearresteerd en uitgeleverd
8859643 ik wil geen woord missen ik heb karadzic in het voorjaar van 1996 voor het laatst gesproken
8859644 ik heb gehoord dat je met een leuk servisch meisje gaat trouwen
8859645 ik ben op een zondagavond in november 1995 gebeld door iemand die bij de dayton onderhandelingen aanwezig was hij vertelde mij dat over deze kwestie werd gesproken ik heb goldstone gebeld die de volgende ochtend een persconferentie belegde waarin hij zei dat hij ontslag zou nemen als in dayton straffeloosheid zou worden beloond ik sluit niet uit dat holbrooke karadzic iets heeft beloofd maar hij zou dat nooit op papier zetten
8859646 ik heb het gezien dat is een fakedocument voor het proces maakt de vermeende holbrooke deal trouwens niets uit daar staat het vn hof buiten
8859647 een verstandig advies ik ben benaderd door een amerikaanse advocaat om ook toe te treden tot de club van adviseurs ik doe het niet want ik zou veel van mijn bosnische vrienden kwijtraken
8859648 en daarbij bestaan er talloze brieven van karadzic waarin hij het leger opdraagt om de conventies van gen ve te eerbiedigen
8859649 dat gaat gebeuren als de europese unie druk op de ketel houdt en geen genoegen neemt met alleen de uitlevering van karadzic ik bespeur die neiging europa beschikt over de diplomatieke macht om te zorgen dat mladic wordt uitgeleverd e n ding weet ik zeker de militaire veiligheidsdienst van servi weet waar hij zit
8859650 girls tend to be better students by the time college admissions come into the picture many watchers of the boy gap agree its too late for the lads to catch up on their own indeed beginning in those formative k 12 years girls watch less television spend less time playing sports and are far less likely to find themselves in detention they are more likely to participate in drama art and music classes extracurriculars that are catnip for admissions officers across the board girls study more score better and are less likely to be placed in special education classes

8859661 as it is under prime minister abdullah ahmad badawi pak lahs government the msc is already given very little room to grow and very little emphasis on its progress
8859662 now it just sounded mscs death knell and its doomed for mediocrity
8859663 this government has reneged on its pledge not to censor the internet and does not have any commitment toward freedom of speech the trying unsuccessfully to control
8859664 i expect its continued attempts to clamp down on blogs will fail and backfire and the ultimate victims will be the governments credibility as well as its various initiatives such as the msc
8859665 the government would have to explain exactly what major wrongdoings were committed by the web site

8859722 la cina cresciuta ed pronta a diventare una potenza mondiale ospitare una olimpiade di successo in linea con la sua ascesa negli ultimi otto anni ha profuso ogni risorsa del governo e della popolazione per questo sforzo e credo ne sia valsa la pena
8859723 negli ultimi anni ho trovato che la gente nutre riserve sulla riunificazione con la cina ma al contempo non affatto restia a fare affari con la cina cos ho inventato uno slogan per la mia campagna no alla riunificazione no allindipendenza no alluso della forza ho cercato di intercettare lopinione condivisa dalla maggioranza della gente credo che questa sia la scelta migliore per taiwan e anche una scelta che la cina potrebbe accettare consentirebbe a entrambe le parti una tregua rendiamoci conto che il nostro paese si trova in una situazione di guerra civile ancora non risolta
8859724 spero che lo sviluppo complessivo del paese far gradualmente emergere una societ democratica soprattutto quando la crescita economica della cina potr produrre una classe media pi ampia sono prudentemente ottimista sul futuro della cina credo che uno sviluppo economico di successo potr aiutarla a diventare una societ pi libera e democratica ma attenzione guardiamo a cosa successo a taiwan ci sono voluti quasi quarantanni per farlo in un posto come la cina con un territorio cos vasto una popolazione enorme con le tante differenze tra le zone costiere e lentroterra e il divario economico tra la gente ci vorr moltissimo tempo

8859731 perch vengono usate quando si presume che il costo del barile scender al di sotto di un limite prestabilito a questo punto ogni previsione oltre i tre mesi un esercizio futile
8859732 non vorrei che questo forte calo del prezzo contribuisca a far restare litalia nella sua posizione di stallo sul fronte della politica energetica da anni litalia non prende decisioni strategiche non studia un piano energetico che ci liberi dalleccessiva dipendenza del petrolio non vorrei che nellillusione di veder tornare il petrolio ai livelli di qualche anno fa ogni progetto alternativo venisse rimesso nel cassetto
8859733 se la tendenza in atto prosegue nei prossimi mesi qualche beneficio per le famiglie italiane e il loro potere dacquisto ci sar soprattutto se il calo del greggio non dipender da una recessione delleconomia globale uno scenario che non appare coerente con landamento delle borse internazionali
8859734 attualmente le put le opzioni di vendita trattate sul nymex che danno il barile a 100 dollari entro fine anno sono oltre 50 mila si suppone che vendendole a questa cifra i trader realizzeranno un bel guadagno visto che il contratto put offre loro la possibilit di cedere a un prezzo prefissato anche se il greggio scendesse sotto quel livello di prezzo
8859735 negli ultimi mesi il mercato petrolifero stato condizionato pesantemente dalle speculazioni sui future al rialzo ora il vento cambiato molti operatori sono scesi dal treno in corsa e ci non pu che riflettersi sul greggio riducendone il prezzo

8859748 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
8859749 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
8859750 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means

8859757 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
8859758 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
8859759 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
8859760 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
8859761 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
8859762 our research shows that the nter nt emergency response has caused immediate and lasting harm
8859763 as medical professionals we are deeply concerned about the impacts
8859764 community members expressed feelings of loss of responsibility loss of control loss of power and a hardening of mistrust towards the australian government and dominant western culture in australia
8859765 this has resulted in feelings of anger and powerlessness it has caused cultural social and emotional harm
8859766 our interviews very powerfully evoked a sense a regressing to the old days many people referred to the feelings of shame humiliation and loss of dignity that particularly characterised an earlier protectionist period when the government controlled every aspect of indigenous peoples lives

8859769 if you want a preview of what the united states would be like under a president obama just look at georgias recent actions georgian president saakashvili like barack obama is owned by the same british godfather george soros
8859770 would soros man obama be another dick cheney if he got into office
8859771 now look at the vast soros cash flow into obama
8859772 soros is a british agent under the control of british foreign intelligence and special operations services he is used by them his sources of funds after his initial bankrolling by the swiss branch of the rothschild banking interests are murky at best soros is part of britains new opium war apparatus and he virtually owns senator obama and now he is fomenting world war provocations against moscow at precisely the moment that i am calling on russia china and india to join the united states in creating a new international financial system that would wipe out speculators like soros altogether
8859773 we thought there was going to be a public parliamentary debate about this he told macquarie radio

8859778 hey you want to go off in the weeds or something
8859779 if we are going to achieve the strategic goals we have set then there needs to be some regeneration of staff involved
8859780 we knew that as a result of the restructuring a number of people were going to leave previously nzc has been a stable environment with a lot of people having worked there over a long period of time
8859781 if we are going to achieve the strategic goals we have set then there needs to be some regeneration of staff involved with a change in the way we are operating you can expect a change in personnel
8859782 we want to get the right person in that job and things will flow from there

8859786 maar dat sneue gezeur van sommige van jullie aan het adres van de redactie is helemaal een zielige vertoning
8859787 i really liked when i came here and played last season the fans are the best in the league
8859788 i was very proud because toronto made a good effort to get me here and i want to respond on the field
8859789 i looked at chad barrett and theres a glisten in his eye amados come alive again carl robinson has come alive
8859790 its not something thats preferable to him mats has said in the past its not something he is totally comfortable with but at the same time you cant say that until youre in that position yourself niedermayer went through this and needed time and perhaps mats is in the same situation
8859791 ive played the same way ive played throughout the year
8859792 i just havent been scoring the way i would like even though i feel like im playing better the little shots around the greens have cost me but im starting to get that turned around and i expect to have a much better week
8859793 even though theyre rookies they know the system and know the other players
8859794 i am a rookie as far as the cfl goes but in my mind i dont feel like a rookie
8859795 i think were trying to be a lot more aggressive even in practice a lot of guys are trying to knock balls down that we might have let go early in the season not that we were being lazy its just being more game like more game ready

8859809 we expect the water to be up to 67 degrees 19 c this week at that level hypothermia is still a major concern
8859810 the reason its difficult is because of the bodys physiology
8859811 before the tournament i was not imagining it this way like it happened today
8859812 so i guess maybe now im going to think about like keep playing
8859813 i thought she was maybe nervous more than i was
8859814 its very frustrating because i know i can play so much better
8859815 i think what i experienced so far is girls when they play against higher ranked players they have nothing to lose so they go for their shots

8859818 all we wanted to do back then was go to the u s
8859819 that was the dream everyone wanted to play down in the states and i had no academic aspirations it was all football the experience was fine but ive grown up ive matured and know that sports ends one day when that happens the back up plan has to be ready
8859820 weve reached the bottom it has to end and this will be the year
8859821 like so many others on this team i want to be part of a different kind of history the one that says this team ended the string of defeats
8859822 i cant believe that people already have us written off again and when i tell my friends that im going to u of t and playing football they said it was a bad decision i dont think so or i wouldnt be here
8859823 i remember trying to recruit him back when he was at cedarbrae but he wanted to explore the u s

8859830 met het overlijden van prins claus is een bijzonder mens heengegaan
8859831 we hebben veel gepraat en hard getraind dat heeft de speelsters dichter bij elkaar gebracht om deze wedstrijd te winnen zullen ze voor elkaar door het vuur moeten gaan en hun eigenheid moeten inleveren dat vinden sommige meiden lastig
8859832 de meiden zijn een stuk fitter dan toen dat bleek eerder deze maand toen we tijdens een trainingskamp in pretoria met 2 1 wonnen van zuid afrika de knvb had voor pretoria gekozen omdat het op grote hoogte ligt daardoor konden we goed werken aan het fysieke deel maar goed de tegenstander heeft ook niet stilgezeten het aantal topsportprogrammas in zwitserland groeit de laatste jaren als paddestoelen uit de grond en met beatrice von siebenthal heeft zwitserland een zeer ervaren coach in huis gehaald
8859833 het is cruciaal met de introductie van de nederlandse eredivisie hebben we een grote stap gezet het aantal vrouwelijke knvb leden is de afgelopen anderhalf jaar met zon 20 000 gegroeid we hebben televisiezendtijd er zijn sponsoren maar ook in het vrouwenvoetbal tel je alleen mee als je internationaal speelt om te professionaliseren zullen we nog meer sponsoren moeten aantrekken en die bereik je vooral op grote toernooien als het ek
8859834 anders dan de hockeysters stonden wij nog nooit in de eindronde van een ek in die zin gaat de vergelijking een beetje mank van de waterpolosters kunnen we daarentegen w l een hoop opsteken in de voorbereiding naar dit toernooi heb ik de meiden een interview laten zien met waterpolocoach robin van galen na de halve finale tegen itali in peking van galen legde in dat gesprek uit wat ervoor nodig is om tot zon prestatie te komen lief en leed met elkaar delen en drie jaar lang alles opzij zetten ik vond het leuk te zien dat zijn boodschap aankwam bij de speelsters die passie en ambitie daar kunnen zij veel van leren want laten we wel wezen er is nog een lange weg te gaan nederland kampt met verschillende blessures waaronder die van heerenveen spits nangila van eyck ja de blessure van nangila is een forse tegenvaller zij is een explosieve speelster iemand die wat extras kan brengen maar ik verwacht veel van tessa oudejans fc utrecht red tessa is pas zestien jaar maar heeft twee duels in het vrouwenelftal onder 19 jaar gespeeld tegen zwitserland krijgt ze een uitgelezen kans haar visitekaartje af te geven
8859835 if you send me a few to use i will fully credit you
8859836 i am watching coverage and it looks nuts to butts there

8859838 he is too loud and it is messing with my audio on msnbc tell him to shut the f up
8859839 this fucking line is completely without control or structure we are seriously in the longest line i have ever seen in my entire life miles long
8859840 kerri i wont tell many people this but i am close to crying just being here there is so much positive energy
8859841 then i kind of sat around and waited for it to come and it didnt

8859848 et nous sommes ici parce que nous aimons trop ce pays pour laisser les quatre prochaines ann es ressembler aux huit derni res
8859849 le bilan est clair john mccain a vot au congr s avec george bush 90 du temps
8859850 le s nateur mccain aime bien parler de jugement mais vraiment que votre jugement veut dire lorsque vous pensez que george bush avait raison plus de 90
8859851 je ne pense pas que le s nateur mccain se moque de ce qui se passe dans la vie des am ricains je pense simplement quil ne le sait pas

8859855 if its painful well dummy dont walk on it if it hurts ya and if it hurts when you touch it then dummy dont touch it
8859856 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8859857 now i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
8859858 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8859859 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8859860 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8859861 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8859862 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8859863 if john mccain wants to follow george bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice but it is not the change american needs
8859864 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8859865 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8859866 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8859867 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done

8859877 the oil tycoons support of john mccain for president demonstrates that his heavily advertised plan for wind power is only hot air
8859878 the governments going to have to provide corridors to transmit the wind energy to the east and west coast second you need to put a 10 year production tax credit
8859879 so let me ask you how do we how do we get republicans to support that kind of investment in renewables
8859880 the gang on capitol hill who have been blocking the renewable production tax credit
8859881 we are facing a planetary emergency which is not like anything we have experienced in the history of humankind
8859882 the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fossil fuels
8859883 we need to invest in innovation i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out to tackle that
8859884 now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning mandatory caps on planet warming carbon
8859885 the carbon based industries have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for all its worth
8859886 taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8859887 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
8859888 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun
8859889 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
8859890 what if i would tell you that ive a 22inch cock is that something you might be intrested in
8859891 tell drama is on my to do list right after inserting needles in my cock
8859892 if you need to put your phone on vibrating at the first meeting press one
8859893 unless carmen electra calls for an emergency titty fuck dont answer
8859894 the cities power plants and factories we build in the next seven years will shape our climate in mid century we have to act now to price carbon and create incentives to change the way we use energy and spread technology and thereby avert nothing less than an existential threat to civilization
8859895 for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8859896 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8859897 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investment in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that sen mccain took office
8859898 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
8859899 as president i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power ill help our auto companies retool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8859900 and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced
8859901 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once more the last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future

8859907 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8859908 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8859909 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8859910 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8859911 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8859912 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8859913 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation
8859914 the 5 hole cbj news and notes 8 26 08
8859915 id like to win the game for one the other thing is id like for us to look decent it seems that the consensus is that we were decent in the jets game even though we lost that one id like to look decent against the bears and go from there
8859916 i told them i can retire now from international ball but lebron james threw out something i didnt like he said he wont play in 2012 unless im there
8859917 j kidd is going to become a player coach now
8859918 i would love to get with those young guys and help them win because i know they are right at the next step of getting to the super bowl
8859919 i would love to be a part of clevelands organization and help them get to that next level
8859920 any team with a superstar could clear cap space and use that same approach with bird rights
8859921 only time will tell with that one there are a lot of things that go into it what we think about the guys we have and things like that sometimes finances get involved so you just take each situation differently and day by day and see

8859926 they will have the same marriage rights as other inmates they will be able to marry non inmates but barred from marrying other inmates in prison
8859927 for instance suppose a prisoner finds out another prisoner has money or other assets they might find themselves coerced into a marriage with a more powerful inmate who might try to lay claim to half their assets
8859928 the law requires they treat people the same so thats a good principle to have in mind when they are drafting regulations

8859941 when you lose a son or daughter in a war theres a purpose to that but when you lose a son or daughter to a drunken driver theres no purpose to that
8859942 these are made of steel and the reason we chose steel is because of the way people die
8859943 theyre literally killed by a steel machine in fact weve done a lot of things here in steel for that very reason
