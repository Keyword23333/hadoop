3400002 as the tensions were rising on thursday night and friday morning the peace corps gathered its members together first the 47 trainees including lindsey harris and then 38 other volunteers who were already working in the country

3400008 im in the camp that argues oils bull run has been demand based up through 2007 demand in the u s rose but this year weve seen a decrease in demand particularly in gasoline consumption as the price went over 4 per gallon
3400009 some tried to argue that oil was decoupled from gasoline demand and from u s demand in general but that thesis is being discredited almost on a weekly basis
3400010 to imply that a pronounced u s economic slowdown and the accompanying reduction in global commerce would not slow energy use was incorrect

3400032 believes in the literal teachings of the bible with respect to spirits demons demon possession and the casting out of demons
3400033 is a positive experience in which the holy spirit comes over a person and influences them
3400034 whether the defendants had intentionally or negligently misapplied church doctrine to laura during these events was not a justiciable controversy
3400035 the laying of hands and the presence of demons are part of the churchs belief system and accepted as such by its adherents these practices are not normally dangerous or unusual and apparently arise in the church with some regularity they are thus to be expected and are accepted by those in the church that a particular member may find the practice emotionally disturbing and non consensual when applied to her does not transform the dispute into a secular matter

3400086 the establishment of a credit information system is part of the capital market reforms supported by the bsp the approval of the cisa bill by the bicameral conference committee moves us closer to the realization of this particular reform
3400087 the bsp will be consulted in the drafting of the implementing rules and regulations anyway so there is going to be continuing involvement of the bsp
3400088 the bsp will still be a part of it and thats good enough
3400089 it will be now cheaper and faster for banks to grant loans and that will reflect on interest rates because they can then afford to lower borrowing costs in the end everybody can get the right credit information thats the most important thing there

3400115 the rights of xstrata and indophil with respect to the tampakan project are set out in a series of agreements between the parties
3400116 those agreements do not confer any right on indophil to market concentrates produced from the tampakan project
3400117 xstrata has clearly communicated to indophil on numerous occasions that it does not intend to provide such consent to indophil or any other sagittarius shareholder
3400118 indophil maintains that there is potential for it to have the opportunity to enter into commercial arrangements with respect to product marketing for the tampakan project

3400120 in mondays edition of the daily debrief i sit down with cnet news reporter tom krazit to discuss the grief hes heard over dropped calls flaky network signals and unreliability of service tom says this is the most feedback hes ever gotten about an apple product flaw of course at amp t points its finger at apple and apple point it right back at at amp t regardless it adds up to one big consumer service snafu on the heels of mobilemes glitches apple execs will likely be happy to put the summer behind them
3400121 widespread complaints about the iphone 3gs reception have spread across the internet in the month since apple and at amp t released the successor to the original iphone the companies insist that nothing is wrong but the complaints have been mounting through e mails water cooler discussions and message boards on apples own web site iphone 3g users are having trouble connecting and staying connected to the 3g networks in their areas
3400122 the issue may be with infineons 3g chip according to richard windsor an analyst with nomura securities
3400123 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3400124 in the end i suspect at amp t will take the brunt of any burden here while customers bought an apple branded phone they have an ongoing contract and business relationship with at amp t that wont let apple off the hook if there are any actual hardware issues that need addressing but at amp t is going to have to step up and own the issue if there is one to be had

3400136 for the past weeks foreign investors are slowly positioning themselves and are bargain hunting the undervalued stocks
3400137 the fundamentals have not really turned around investors would still remain cautious and as of the moment we are not going to see any reversal to the bull market

3400150 its all systems go for charter change and we are supporting joint resolution 10 which is pending in the senate it is a joint resolution to convene congress into a constituent assembly for the purpose of revising the constitution to establish a federal government
3400151 it will be the way forward especially on the work to set up a federal government to respond to the bangsamoro aspiration which is contained in the memorandum of agreement which was temporarily shelved
3400152 it is because of insinuations that she president gloria macapagal arroyo is going for charter change to extend her term which is unfair for her
3400153 all efforts to open up the constitution and to come up with an agreement on ancestral domain agreement is a means of responding to historical aspiration of the bangsamoro people
3400154 i would like to say that resolution 10 speaks only of a federal system it does not deal with the adoption of a parliamentary system under which gloria can conceivably extend her term by running for prime minister
3400155 i have been going around the country speaking of federalizing the republic for if you federalize only the bangsamoro muslim homeland area there will be uproar why only them
3400156 that is still an alternative in the event that the federal setup nationwide will not take place
3400157 i dont think you can do that adopt federalism only in parts of mindanao the philippines is already defined as one state

3400169 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best

3400184 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

3400188 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

3400195 when i first started making my jewelry pieces people would comment that they looked medieval or conan like some would say gothic and others would say sci fi or heavy metal armadillon was actually a world i created in my head perhaps a parallel dimension inhabited by warriors and mystical creatures in my mind it was a world ravaged by war and chaos which eventually led to its destruction an armageddon of sorts
3400196 i usually let my pieces take their own shape especially the sculptural cuffs from experience thats how my best pieces were made but occasionally when i have an idea for a pendant ring or earrings i try to sketch the image thats in my head so that i wont forget about it i have a scrapbook of sketches many of them drawn on little crumpled pieces of paper or napkins youll be surprised how often an idea has come along while i was at a restaurant or movie or someplace like that
3400197 traditional can get boring i think my work caters to an audience that has grown tired of finesse and isnt afraid to equate taste with daring
3400198 i like to think of myself as a creative being my first bracelet was made from a pair of handcuffs that i had cut in half so that the chains would dangle down quite heavy but boy did they make a statement sometime after college i realized that i wanted to pursue making my wearable creations and that fashion was my art of choice my calling
3400199 my career has been about taking hold of opportunities and learning with them ive had a lot of people pass on me i wasnt drafted i wasnt heavily recruited i didnt go to a big college so im used to people telling me no but there are always other ways so im very grateful to the russian team to accept me as one of their own and i still love my country it doesnt really have anything to do with that i just want to play basketball

3400218 enacting a property tax cap is a good starting point but it is only one piece of the puzzle
3400219 a tax cap is a gimmick that does nothing to lower property taxes for hard pressed new yorkers
3400220 a tax cap would harm education programs widen the achievement gap and reduce local control over schools
3400221 for those state leaders who are really serious about providing tax relief there are other better options

3400230 hopefully youre so satisfied from the cookies that youre not going to want to go and eat anything else until your sensible dinner
3400231 if you ate a few chips ahoy or a few mrs fields and you didnt go overboard and then you ate a reasonable dinner and kept your calories under control technically its very similar to the cookie diets
3400232 however the cookie diets are either fortified with a little bit of fiber or protein or some vitamins and minerals to keep you full and add a little extra nutrition

3400234 most criminal prosecutions occur when a person subject to usdot regulations has intentionally provided false or fraudulent records or statements to the agency
3400235 examples would be driver records maintenance records application forms and in some circumstances statements to inspectors and investigators
3400236 such tragedies are becoming all too common and many of these deadly accidents are preventable

3400245 our goal was to work hard and keep our pressure
3400246 the main thing was to keep some consistency overall i was very pleased
3400247 we achieved our goal we tried to minimize the gap
3400248 playing the us was inspirational for us they are the best
3400249 they played very hard start to finish you have to respect a team that is going all out to the end
3400250 our main thing is to get better thats what we want to do every day
3400251 we havent shot the ball well from the outside as a team since weve been here but im sure we will
3400252 if we start hitting threes we will be a lot better we havent really gotten hot yet and it hasnt affected the intensity of our defense that says a lot about our guys
3400253 our opponent is the strongest team in the world we tried our best
3400254 im sure the whole continent was watching when you play the us everybody is going to be watching you have to do something
3400255 losing by 20 to the usa is not bad at all they were great
3400256 we understand the nba is loved in the whole world
3400257 we are being watched on how we look and what we do we take that with a lot of pride
3400258 it was incredible watching the play where lebron james dunked the ball with his left hand after doing some air movements
3400259 im going to play very aggressively defensively be a leader and offensively attack and make plays for others
3400260 i wanted to win the game but it was impossible

3400310 it is hard not to be spooked by the currency
3400311 if we had the 2007 rate for 2008 our sales line would have had 47 million more on the top line and we would have been about 20 million more in profit
3400312 stripping away the significant impact of the appreciation of the australian dollar sales were up 18 per cent in constant currency
3400313 but it is not perfect and does not protect the sales revenue line
3400314 the impact on net profit of foreign exchange movements compared with 2007 even after hedging was a negative 20 9 million
3400315 unless the rba successfully loosens the policy stance and does so quickly 2009 could well develop into a very hard landing
3400316 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3400317 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3400318 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3400319 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3400320 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3400321 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3400322 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3400323 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3400324 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3400325 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3400326 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3400327 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3400328 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3400329 china mens team loses again we have nothing more to say
3400330 all we heard was a loud boom and we werent sure if it was the dumpster out back being emptied or a heavy truck traveling past our building or whatnot
3400331 we practiced on dry trails well before the race so when the rain came it changed everything
3400332 you had to pick new lines and just go for it
3400333 this was not an easy track to begin with and the weather made it even tougher
3400334 i had a crash in the middle of the course and one of my shoes came off i had to stay strong and keep motivated to make up the time
3400335 this course is like three times as long as what im use to on the world cup
3400336 you really need to stay focused on such a long hard course
3400337 the band wanted a big name who could easily hold his own and reckon lenny is just the man for the job
3400338 vaananen is a big guy is physical and is capable of playing against the top players on the other team you might term him as more of a shut down guy he has experience in the league although he went back overseas for last year i think both of those guys are going to be valuable additions to our blue line
3400339 i guess we wont know until we get through it but for one thing its going to include a lot more travel which will be a little more taxing but i think it will be great for the fans to see some more teams they dont often get to see
3400340 i think it might change the dynamics of the standings last year with everybody playing so many games within the division we had a big bulk moving along together in the standings i think you might see some separation this year with the different format
3400341 very well i think we forget sometimes that we were missing a guy like gagne for most of the year he only played a handful of games but he is a world class player thats great at both ends of the rink he will help us in every situation and were just hopeful that he continues to progress the way he has hes getting back into great shape and he has no signs of any symptoms that he had before
3400342 for me the biggest challenge and biggest difference was the schedule in the american league you play primarily around the weekends and in the nhl it just never ends you play every other day it seems like all year long you really have to manage your time to work and time to rest
3400343 also just the level of the players here youre dealing with the best players in the world and you really have to pay attention to matchups if you get the wrong matchups you can get hurt in a hurry those two things stand out the most
3400344 you never like to see players like r j go but its just the way the cap is now you can only keep so many players i think r j is going to continue to be a really good player in the league but we have other guys that have shown the versatility of umby we have some young players that are going to get an opportunity such as scottie upshall really came on last year at the end of the year we seem to have a lot of players with the ability to move around like umby did i dont know if you replace him but certainly theres guys in our lineup that are capable of more responsibility and can take more minutes and more situations
3400345 i think i was a small part of the history of the spectrum but the times that i had here were certainly some of the great times of my hockey experience we won the championship in 1998 while getting to play in the old spectrum its kind of sad to see it go but as time goes on you see a lot of these great buildings go down theres certainly some memories that will be solidified before that happens
3400346 terry murray was a valuable part of our staff and had been here for a long time and we certainly wish him the best with the opportunity hes going to get in los angeles but we feel very confident with craig berube coming back i think hes a great young coach that has a great feel for the game were going to shuffle some things and some responsibilities more than likely jack mcilhargey will run the defense and chief will be more involved with our team system play and a lot of teaching with our young players hes very familiar with our young players because hes been around the organization for a number of years and i think well have continuity in the way things are done even though terry has left
3400347 i think ive come full circle with this ive been criticized for being calm and complimented for it at the same time ive learned my lessons over the years that you have to be able to think through the emotion of the game and keep your head in the game i think its misinterpreted sometimes but theres a fire burning inside you just have to keep your head in the game and keep the players on track and i think weve been able to do that
3400348 i actually think its a luxury that is good to have if you look at last year we had alexandre picard ryan parent nate guenin and all these young guys that are knocking at the door theres going to be injuries and youre going to need more than six or seven guys to play we have guys developed to the point where they are ready or almost ready and theres nothing wrong with spending a little more time in the minors and being more ready rather than coming in when youre not ready this organization has done a great job at creating depth at the defensive position and i think its only going to help us through the course of the season when injuries set in
3400349 if you look at last year we had probably 13 or 14 guys with career years in different categories
3400350 the disrupter the one in the market that changes the rules
3400351 we are sustaining now very strong growth in post paid and pre paid customers in contrast to over 12 months ago
3400352 telstra has traditionally won a lot of customer share by virtue of being the only one who could offer large scale coverage
3400353 in regional areas where telstras share is often 50 per cent plus compared to their national share of 40 to 42 per cent then that clearly offers an opportunity to us to make some inroads
3400354 it left behind a dark pigmentation that will take six months or more to fade
3400355 hay que tener lealtad a la hora de hacer los planteamientos y no utilizar una cuesti n como forma de presi n para conseguir otros objetivos
3400356 ese argumento nunca debi ser utilizado ni verbalizado porque no tiene ning n sentido
3400357 yo creo prosigui que el gobierno de catalu a y el conseller de econom a y hacienda de la generalitat tienen que tener mayor sosiego y mayor tranquilidad

3400374 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3400375 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3400376 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3400377 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3400378 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3400379 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3400380 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3400381 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers
3400382 we have been implementing strict measures to prevent the scalping of tickets
3400383 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3400384 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used
3400385 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3400386 we really dont know as much about obesity as we think we do
3400387 a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3400388 our study shows you can still be healthy even if you are obese
3400389 altogether 10 percent of the study population and 25 percent of the obese subjects had a high insulin sensitivity phenotype or metabolically benign obesity
3400390 our data suggest that ectopic fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3400391 thats an area that we are very intrigued with as well
3400392 if you start stuffing people with calories it is very much like making pate from goose liver
3400393 its not really where my career goals are focused right now
3400394 im really looking down the line pretty far and this might be a step backwards
3400395 you know steve sanders lives on in our hearts and in our minds
3400396 i think that its fantastic theyre trying to recapture some of the excitement that 90210 brought to a decade
3400397 we continue to believe that our australian businesses will continue to perform well and obviously weve got some issues on the macro side in new zealand
3400398 its a varied environment in australia not as difficult as in new zealand but single markets like the radio market will be very tough
3400399 i wouldnt hold your breath about any major acquisitions but at the same time if the right opportunities present themselves wed be interested
3400400 whatever else history may say about me when im gone i hope it will record that i appealed to your best hopes not your worst fears to your confidence rather than your doubts my dream is that you will travel the road ahead with libertys lamp guiding your steps and opportunitys arm steadying your way
3400401 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

3400422 if i did have that magic wand in australia i would definitely focus on energy diversity
3400423 i would ask myself do i need to be importing any petroleum at all into this country why would you want to not import petroleum with all the money that flows out of your economy why wouldnt you want to control your own destiny
3400424 our immediate focus is to get this car developed and get it in the market in the united states

3400680 i immediately recognized that it could be a great guerrilla marketing idea for one of our clients sto corp a leading manufacturer of exterior wall coatings and claddings their products just happen to be sold in a bright yellow bucket boldly branded with their iconic logo

3400692 every summer the department sees an increase in calls from the public about potential exposure to rabid animals
3400693 although there have been no active cases of human rabies in rhode island it is common in many wild animals such as bats raccoons foxes and strays so people are at risk it is important to use common sense when dealing with domestic stray or wild animals the fact that we have had no human cases reflects our states aggressive approach to evaluating each potentially risky exposure for early treatment and vaccination
3400694 when a sacrilege is carried out especially concerning the eucharistic species the entire church is called to pray together to heal the offense committed against the lord jesus christ who is alive and present in those hosts

3400707 sces financial stability and business reputation will increase the probability that 250 mw of solar pv systems will be available to meet the states solar rooftop goals over the next five years
3400708 in so doing a solar pv program can improve efficiencies to reduce costs and jump start the competitiveness of solar pv for widespread application on california roofs
3400709 even though this program is kind of taking bread out of our own mouth the demand for solar will keep going up
3400710 its game changing and opens up whole new realms of what solar can do thats exciting
3400711 its certainly possible that a young growing industry that is pretty fragmented could be hurt by this rather than helped

3400747 shiseido ensures highest level of business security and continuity with lumension security
3400748 before establishing polices and implementing lumensions solution to enforce them we were constantly chasing fires that were spreading across all four of our u s sites nearly every day we were dealing with a different worm or virus that made its way onto our network most of which were the result of un patched vulnerabilities in our operating systems
3400749 with lumensions solutions were able to quickly proactively assess and eliminate all known vulnerabilities and contain any malware through the cost savings on it staff resources alone we were able to achieve roi in just three months
3400750 because we are a japanese company with a global presence compliance is a major issue lumensions vulnerability management suite helps us meet the japanese version of sarbanes oxley as well as various other requirements by developing clear policies and procedures for our patch and vulnerability management processes we are also able to track software licenses dynamically something that is very important when signing contracts with microsoft and ibm
3400751 additionally we are able to react to issues more quickly which is as important as any quantifiable roi figures lumensions vulnerability management suite gives us a more security centric view of the network allowing us to gain greater insight into the network and a better overall view into the system we are able to more rapidly adjust to changes in the business making our it operation much more proactive and flexible and therefore more productive

3400760 and yes its our goal to make gum treatment a pleasant experience for all patients
3400761 barotex enables our design team to create some of the strongest and most durable automotive components ever produced
3400762 for the natalia sls 2 barotex will be formed into various body panels and our revolutionary d tek chassis where its high strength will add significantly to the automobiles torsional rigidity yet our chassis will be more than a thousand pounds lighter than the conventional steel chassis found on other luxury automobiles of similar size
3400763 in contrast carbon fiber products are petroleum based and we know about the challenges that involves
3400764 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile traveled
3400765 we recently received our patent for the proprietary process used to produce barotex
3400766 we are delighted that the first production automobile to integrate this technology will be dimoras natalia sls 2 which abounds with technological breakthroughs from bumper to bumper
3400767 when we began designing our 16 cylinder engine that would erupt with 1200 horsepower we decided to call it the volcano v16 its only natural that we now surround the dimora volcano with volcanic rock from barotex
3400768 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3400769 i think its high time not only to make statements about democracy but to take concrete steps in protecting the people that are suffering for trying to be democrats
3400770 unless you send us troops nato troops you will not be able to remove russian troops from south ossetia it would require war and i dont think we are ready for that
3400771 weve been given a number of security instructions but i cannot give you those details

3400789 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3400790 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3400791 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3400792 will also deliver an address at a reception for rep calvert at a private residence in san clemente
3400793 huge profits for himself and his personal firm off his own earmark under federal investigation with pork projects
3400794 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3400795 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3400796 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3400797 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3400798 shes biting her lip while shes doing the combination dial and i get the sudden urge to bite it for her her lips not the dial man im losing it
3400799 but liberals and democrats also abetted the triumph of the right they mostly stopped arguing over theory democrats and liberals won some policy battles and some elections and they presided over a prosperous moment but they did it by selling themselves as reagan lite by overselling small social advances pilot projects and placebos and by riding the crest of a credit boom that could not be sustained
3400800 however liberal economists today get a painful surprise when they look back and see what the first modern liberal franklin roosevelt attempted for while new dealers of the 1930s and mainstream liberal economists of the 1970s share a common commitment toward income redistribution contemporary liberal economists have far greater respect for the value of competitive market mechanisms in making sure there is something to redistribute

3400836 i will not subscribe to a hoax on the american people that if you drill offshore youre going to bring down the price at the pump even the president says thats not true
3400837 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3400838 the united states cannot drill its way to energy independence
3400839 the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
3400840 im with you ten hours a day on our short days i can tell when you alter the tempo you brush your teeth with in the morning i certainly know when youve been laid

3400842 ive seen the man hes a pretty boy by nature pretty boys are utterly disappointing as lovers theyre too worried about getting something under their nails
3400843 well im guessing you want me to agree with you that petes gay
3400844 so whats your evidence hes metro sure but i really thought that asking you out disproved my whole gay theory
3400845 pete was basically trying to imply that i was gay
3400846 not particularly its a label those usually end up hurting people
3400847 i dont think gay is funny and i have no problem if pete is
3400848 i just think that hes gotten the wrong impression and i dont know why a straight guy whos sleeping with me would want to think that im gay
3400849 did you ever think that maybe he doesnt want to think that but he cant help but think it
3400850 i was with tom for six years did i ever show any indication of being anything other than completely straight
3400851 you seemed very much one half of a prototypical hetero couple
3400852 there is always gay and then there is newly gay
3400853 the one who wore the looking for mr right t shirt the day gay marriage passed and had his entire bedroom decorated in boy band pictures all through high school
3400854 you seem to know a lot about floral print tom
3400855 thats always gay then theres the really kind of conservative even though you reside in the most liberal city in the country and never really thought about it until a redheaded reporter weaseled her way inside of you with her enormous heart and her huge sparkly bedroom eyes and made you think about it newly gay
3400856 sounds to me like youre the one who wants to sleep with her

3401163 the two guys were out there for a few hours this morning they did three laps on their time trial bikes
3401164 after accounting for all common clinical conditions predictive of stroke we found this increase was statistically significant sleeping nine hours or more is strongly associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke
3401165 the prevalence in women of having long sleep duration is much lower than having sleep duration less than six hours so the overall public health impact of short sleep is probably larger than long sleep
3401166 this study provides additional evidence that habitual sleep patterns in postmenopausal women could be important for determining the risk of ischemic stroke
3401167 our study population is a very specific group and the duration of sleep needed for optimal health probably differs for various population groups
3401168 people who feel that their sleep problems are a burden to their daytime activities are encouraged to discuss their concerns with physicians who can better interpret their significance and offer advice in the context of their overall health
3401169 our data do not imply that if women with long sleep cut their sleep hours they would be at a lower risk
3401170 at this point we still cannot determine that long sleep causes ischemic stroke the observed increase in stroke risk in long sleepers may be due to some unmeasured factors such as undiagnosed sleep disorders although we did attempt to account for that in our analysis
3401171 further studies are needed to help us understand the possible mechanisms involved in the associations found in this study
3401172 because there are very limited neurobiological data relating long sleep to an increased risk of coronary heart disease or ischemic stroke that also is found in other large epidemiologic studies
3401173 but we will also not hesitate to caution against misguided actions and statements of individuals that inaccurately and unnecessarily potray the police in a negative light
3401174 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3401175 children and adolescents with stroke have remarkable differences in presentation compared with adults
3401176 in newborns the first symptoms of stroke are often seizures that involve only one arm or one leg that symptom is so common that stroke is thought to account for about 10 percent of seizures in full term newborns seizure is a much less common stroke symptom in adults
3401177 stroke in children is uncommon but not as rare as we used to think
3401178 even as recently as 20 years ago stroke was an unlikely diagnosis in a child because it was so strongly associated with adults with atherosclerosis
3401179 primary prevention stopping the first stroke from occurring is sometimes possible in children when we know of an underlying risk factor such as a heart problem or sickle cell disease aside from those conditions an initial stroke is difficult to prevent because the stroke is often the first sign of a problem
3401180 thats why its critical to promptly recognize and diagnose a stroke because treating the cause reduces the likelihood of additional strokes

3401295 weve been adding exchange servers to cope with email proliferation tacking on more every year because of the large amount of historical data we need to access we knew that quotas wouldnt be a good fit for us we needed a better more long term approach to dealing with the explosion of email following an roi analysis we determined that deploying mimosa nearpoint would enable us to remove mailbox quotas and receive rapid roi
3401296 mimosa nearpoint has the capability to scale seamlessly as we grow we expect to see continued growth in the future so we needed a long term solution that would scale with us
3401297 with mimosas content archiving solution in place foxwoods will eliminate email quotas while centrally managing retention policy for email communication which is critical to a fast growing organization like foxwoods

3401312 when you go away on a vacation and deliberately stay out of touch with whats going on you half expect the world to have changed by the time you get back and sometimes its nice when it really does
3401313 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3401314 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3401315 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3401320 you need to record something like this because its not everyday you find something that looks like this running around out in the middle of the county
3401321 you know its just kind of one of those things to hear about and talk about but to actually see something on video that may actually be a live one thats pretty amazing
3401322 maybe its better to just think it is the chupacabra and just leave it at that
3401323 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3401324 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3401325 these are the kinds of things you see in e mails that you see circulating about obama in this sort of subterranean smear campaign against him you never see these things voiced by the candidates
3401326 had sen clinton followed mark penns advice it would have caused her more angst than good
3401327 whats going on right now is that a lot of obama supporters and fundraisers are trying very hard to retire sen clintons debt one reason theyve had difficulty doing so is the dislike among obama people for mark penn specifically
3401328 they tend to blame him for the nature of these negative attacks
3401329 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3401330 this was a historic campaign people thought it would be an easy march to the nomination and then an easy win in the fall and instead weve had this historic presidential election where shes collapsed and a first term senator has won the democratic nomination
3401331 so i think its just the nature of the defeat has made a lot of people frustrated and theres certainly people out there who really want the kind of full story to come to light so people can understand exactly what happened
3401332 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3401333 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3401334 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right

3401361 weve lost a lot of dedicated experienced officers its very sad seeing these guys go but i understand why theyre leaving
3401362 as soon as they started talking about it back in february we saw crime jump
3401363 criminals know were short staffed now were seeing people coming here from richmond and oakland because they think its fertile ground
3401364 i think for the police to say they cant handle certain crimes is completely irresponsible disrespectful and for people who live here very threatening
3401365 im here because i love vallejo but its a simple numbers game the more cops we have the more effective we can be
3401366 we just moved here from richmond and ive slept better than i have in years
3401367 theres not as many sirens or ambulances i feel much safer here and i think the police have been great
3401368 theres a lot of stuff going on in this town and i worry about the young people theres nothing for them to do but get in trouble
3401369 you can add another 100 officers and break ins will still happen because were in a tight economy
3401370 community policing and getting to know your neighbors is the way to reduce crime not putting more officers in cars
3401371 they say were the cash cow that broke the city its not true but the upshot is that we feel unwanted

3401381 the kids would get to pick out their price and theyd get excited

3401383 once you have your own child it has an effect on you
3401384 you start thinking about the world you want your kids to grow up in
3401385 i totally condemn this action by a local landlord which in my view is racist and therefore unacceptable landlords and the business community as well as public figures need to condemn this shocking action by an individual landlord
3401386 intolerance cannot and will not be accepted by this community and i know that the people of the donegal road do not condone this and i applaud the community activists from the greater village regeneration trust for condemning this incident this should send a strong message to those in our community that seek to damage community relations and to engage in forms of discrimination

3401397 i cant speak for the other teams but this group of draft choices was widely viewed as having more nhl ready players than any in recent years
3401398 we dont often speak in those terms with such young players
3401399 guys his size that play the perimeter you have concerns about moving up to the next level but pat gets his nose dirty gets into the traffic areas and he doesnt get knocked down he has a solid wide base for his size and when he gets stronger its going to be even more difficult to knock him down
3401400 im not sure his size is a factor because of the way the game has changed in the nhl and small players with speed are excelling in my opinion hes a special player and is going to do just fine
3401401 these guys have never been through a schedule like this
3401402 a year and a half ago erik johnsons playing high school hockey now hes playing against men 35 years of age he and david perron have both hit the wall at certain times and thats totally expected you have to read these young players if theyre not playing well or have hit the wall they need to be recharged they need to get the batteries full again so they can go continue playing the bottom line here is that part of having a young player grow is you take two or three steps forward youre going to take a step back its part of growth maturing at the nhl level our opinion is we want this team when we get there to be a long term good team and you have to go through growing pains to get there
3401403 were not in the business to not put the best players we have on the ice regardless of age
3401404 weve kept an open mind in training camp each year and kept youngsters like jonathan toews and the same may also happen with kyle beach this year if hes ready to make the jump to the next level
3401405 i figured if i pay the price now its going to pay off in the long run
3401406 i get up at 6 30 a m and im usually out the door by 6 45 a m and in the gym by 8 30 a m its a long drive but i feel like its worth it for the summer its good for me and its part of the commitment that i wanted to make to show that i can get to the next level the schedule pretty much makes you behave all summer it keeps me out of trouble theres no going out at night it keeps me focused on my goal i know what i want

3401447 what carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media it was their favorable coverage of carter and his campaign that gave him an edge propelling him rocket like to the top of the opinion polls this helped carter win key primary election victories enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to president elect in the short space of 9 months
3401448 the ford forces pounded away at the experience question and painted carter as a political illusion an affable seeming politician who was terrified of expressing his opinion on any controversial topic

3401453 normally the magazine carries seven poems in each issue so the editors submitted more poems but by the time the censors pass the regular publication date of 20th of every month had passed

3401511 the violence between russia and georgia quickly thrust foreign policy into the u s presidential election with john mccain standing to benefit and barack obama facing a more perilous situation
3401512 as such the conflict gave sen obama the opportunity to show that he is indeed prepared but it also gave prominence to foreign policy one of the few areas where polling shows that sen mccain has a clear advantage with voters
3401513 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and has now violated the space of another country
3401514 obamas campaign made two early missteps first in its initial statement it called for restraint from both russia and georgia then obamas campaign released a statement questioning mccains objectivity in the crisis because a top mccain aide randy scheunemann had lobbied for the georgians
3401515 senator john mccain who has met the republic of georgias president and whose chief foreign policy adviser has lobbied for the country responded to the news friday with visceral anger condemning russian forces crossing into georgia and warning of grave repercussions in long term relations between moscow and washington
3401516 the intensifying warfare in the former soviet republic of georgia has put a new focus on the increasingly hard line that senator john mccain has taken against russia in recent years with stances that have often gone well beyond those of the bush administration and its focus on engagement
3401517 his hard line has been derided as provocative and possibly dangerous by some so called realist foreign policy experts who warn that isolating russia would do little to encourage it to change
3401518 but others including neoconservatives who deem promoting democracy a paramount goal see mr mccains position as principled and prescient
3401519 this moment calls for more than playacting yet obama looks lost without a presidential script
3401520 perhaps this is not a time for a novice spouting grand rhetoric about a new page in history but for someone whos actually read the pages of some old but still relevant books perhaps this is not the time for playacting perhaps it is not the time for body surfing
3401521 tempered his comments saying we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3401522 the contrasting tenor of their statements came as aides to both presidential candidates scrambled to reconfigure their policies toward russia reckoning with a war that analysts said marked a major turning point in the already tense relationship between russia and the united states
3401523 if voters ultimately dont get exercised over whats now occurring in georgia it wont be for mccains lack of trying
3401524 my guess is that most americans see this as an obscure regional dispute not a portentous historical moment akin to the fall of the berlin wall
3401525 there was much talk in december that benazir bhuttos assassination would boost hillary clinton who much like mccain does now claimed that such a reminder of our perilous world argued for someone with her experience in the white house iowa voters didnt buy it and id guess much the same will go for mccain
3401526 a wikipedia editor emailed political wire to point out some similarities between sen john mccains speech today on the crisis in georgia and the wikipedia article on the country georgia
3401527 given the closeness of the words and sentence structure most would consider parts of mccains speech to be derived directly from wikipedia

3401666 i dont know man 26 years old and i feel like im a truly old vet on the team
3401667 i was brought here just to be an addition to this team not the main piece
3401668 with all these young guys flying around im not too concerned about being the only receiver out there because i know thats not going to be the case
3401669 i would love to juggle being a returner and a receiver hopefully if i am playing more receiver returning will be a situational thing the adrenaline of being a returner is unbelievable i really dont want to relinquish that to anybody
3401670 i dont want to pass that rush on to anybody i love it man its like no other man its the unexpected about being back there
3401671 im open and willing to anything whatever coach wants from me ill do it
3401672 the tests that weve given him appear to be ok
3401673 but he can hardly tie his shoes right now so were just working on it
3401674 you guys can do the math on the thing weve got about three weeks to go here youve got to practice a little bit its getting to a little bit of a crucial time here
3401675 i think vallos is doing a great job but its hard yeah
3401676 the line is coming together nicely i believe its going to be a good line but center is an important position for us
3401677 im expecting spencer to take the next step so this time hes missing is tough its going to be tough on him i absolutely think hes capable he just has to get healthy
3401678 as a competitor i thought i played well enough to show what i can do but nothings etched in stone

3401683 i always say you can learn from each other i have very valuable feedback from media players and the players association they all came with recommendations
3401684 starting this season there will be a pre meeting before the games with coaches captains and referees
3401685 because otherwise maybe you get one coach saying with him he the referee takes five minutes with me only 20 seconds we have to be very careful about this
3401686 they each called it frustrating sometimes and then i said to them do you have feedback do you see the game afterwards and they said yes we do
3401687 then i said how many times were you wrong and the assistant was wrong and believe me the coaches were more often wrong than the assistants
3401688 i interviewed all of the coaches and they were very honest some of them never saw a law book for the last five or six years
3401689 in my opinion we can be more open but all the referees must be ready for that

3401699 my immediate goal is to win the starting job for the western force and hopefully play some really good consistent rugby next year
3401700 there is plenty of competition in the halfback position at the force with chris oyoung and justin turner but ill do my best to put my name up there during the pre season and take it from there

3401713 absolutely that will be the case after a five year period in term why wouldnt that be the case
3401714 weve got to be mature enough to handle that and deal with it
3401715 coming into the last year of contract with speculation and everything else that will go on over that six month period before the season
3401716 but thats no problem were all big boys we know thats where its exactly going to sit so i wont shy away from that at all
3401717 would i love to see brett deledio get to 25 years of age to see trent cotchin when hes got 100 games under his belt when our backmen have played together five or six seasons absolutely thats my desire to do that
3401718 ill be working as hard as i can to do my part of it and then decisions will be made
3401719 if we continue to improve with young players playing well were heading in the right direction
3401720 if we stagnate now that weve got young players playing or dont continue to improve well were not heading in the right direction
3401721 not where we want to be but a step in the right direction
3401722 no not really i just want to go out there and do my job do my role

3401732 la diferencia de porosidad entre uno y otro as como el distinto grado de disgregaci n nos obliga a plantearnos mecanismos diferentes de limpieza y consolidaci n vemos entonces que el recinto arqueol gico no es un lugar estanco sino que est sujeto a m ltiples variantes y cambios que pueden darse en el d a a d a
3401733 elementos de combusti n como el azufre mon xido y di xido de carbono forman cidos en contacto con el ox geno y la humedad del ambiente en las rocas de origen volc nico se pueden dar procesos qu micos en los cuales los minerales de la piedra se transforman en arcillas o en otros compuestos dando lugar a diferencias de color textura porosidad y resistencia para evitar estos problemas se deben hacer an lisis estudios y planes de actuaci n
3401734 este proceso requiere de un exhaustivo trabajo muy meticuloso y donde hasta la paciencia juega un papel importante y los resultados son generalmente muy evidentes como pasa cuando se trata monedas es sorprendente c mo en un fragmento de cobre informe tras un exhaustivo proceso de limpieza y anal tica comienzan a intuirse los dibujos de la superficie de esta forma podemos identificar la poca el valor y en numerosos casos hasta el lugar donde se acu la pieza
3401735 una vez concluidos estos trabajos ese nuevo material pasar a estar disponible para renovar o completar la exposici n del museo y parque arqueol gico cueva pintada en otros casos podr iniciarse un programa de investigaci n intentando descubrir nuevos datos que nos ayuden a entender un poco m s la vida y la mentalidad del antiguo pueblo canario

3401739 without saying names i have spoken to a number of the players who were hoping to keep
3401740 we all know theres two new teams coming in next season the players ive spoken to all of them have been very positive about next season and possibly further
3401741 its moving along well most of it will be done before the season starts or a week or so in
3401742 if there are others that are uncertain theyll just see out their contracts and we either negotiate at the end of the season or whenever its appropriate
3401743 through agents that you talk to all the feedback is the players want to know what my situation is
3401744 i cant in good conscience and good faith say i want you to sign for another two years or another three years and then leave
3401745 dannys 35 but craigs still only 32 so craigs still got at least another three years left in him
3401746 i think the most important thing is that theyre happy within the club the structure weve got the setup weve got
3401747 its not just about what their pay packet is its being happy in the environment that theyre in so if thats the case which it seems that way with most of them now theres no reason why we cant keep the ones we want to keep
3401748 itd be nice to think that during my tenure here at the queensland roar that we bring a championship to this state
3401749 the 1997 and the 2003 cabinet approvals were legally appropriate documents and the process was never questioned by the auditor general it was in accordance with those approvals that the ministry of health procured its medicines and goods the auditor general made recommendations in its 2005 and 2006 reports that the letters of approval from cabinet ought to be renewed through the tender board the ministry of health has since accepted the recommendation of the auditor general
3401750 it just gets said every week and you sort of get a bit sick of it in the end
3401751 theyre going to try to pressure us on our ball and going to try to get into me like angle in on me and the same happens on their ball
3401752 people dont want to see scrums becoming nothing do they they still want to see a bit of the good old stuff where two teams are trying to get at each other i dont think its cheating its just two teams going at it
3401753 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3401754 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organisation today and thats a shame

3401765 i think a big thing in playing first grade is confidence and hes naturally a very confident kid
3401766 theres certain guys who can play first grade at a young age and theres certain ones youve got to leave a little bit longer but i thought confidence wise he doesnt lack anything there
3401767 in all honesty hes not really ready for first grade
3401768 hes got a lot of ability i think that was on display for everyone to see i was very pleased with what i saw especially from the future point of view

3401790 they are friends and keep in touch via e mail
3401791 any side that makes the top eight can beat anyone in the top eight the only difference is that probably melbourne and manly have been very consistent as far as their season is concerned that doesnt mean anything when it comes to a one off game in a playoff
3401792 the only bonus for the top four obviously is the first home semi and playing melbourne in a phone box thats a definite advantage for them
3401793 if they run eighth i wouldnt really want to play them if i ran first
3401794 theyre right up there the sides weve played recently have all been big physical sides in melbourne canberra and the knights very similar
3401795 four big games and four sides coming into the finals who probably think that they can beat us
3401796 its a good test for us if were good enough to make the eight
3401797 if you ask whether wed rather have this draw or one with the roosters cronulla like the period weve just been through im sure wed take this one

3401799 significant margin pressure could result in profits for its fiscal third quarter coming in 5 6 cents a share below the street consensus of 27 cents a share
3401800 the companys fundamentals are as good as ever so i dont know what the big to do is
3401801 i dont know how to respond to some of these analyst reports
3401802 the decline in sales from the second quarter to the third quarter was due in part to the reduced shipments against two major wind contracts the timing of shipments between the periods and lower technical fiber sales
3401803 the companys sales goal for fiscal 2008 was based upon assumptions which included the successful completion of a new contract from a major wind turbine customer
3401804 however zoltek experienced a dearth of significant new contracts from customers in the wind energy field over the past year which the company attributes to concerns among wind turbine producers regarding the availability and pricing of the high performance carbon fibers used in making the longest and most powerful wind turbine blades

3401810 as a former australia test player a coach and someone who lives in pakistan he is in a unique position to give his perspective to those stakeholders
3401811 i dont want to comment on what is good and what is not good but i hope the icc addresses the players concerns adequately and not only convinces me but also players who have shown concerns over playing in pakistan
3401812 there was advice that we received from the security consultants that it might be better not to start the competition from the 11th and move to the 12th
3401813 it is a strong possibility that we will reduce the champions trophy to two venues but the event will be played in pakistan
3401814 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players

3401835 women are on the front lines leading initiatives central to the success of the aids response yet they are not full participants at all levels of the response the power of their participation needs to be fully realized
3401836 it is necessary to fulfill the commitments made to ensuring womens and girls voices concerns and perspectives are incorporated in the decision making processes that affect their lives
3401837 hiv positive women and other key populations need to be more than bystanders or advisors in the formation of the content and direction of the aids response they must be supported to be leaders

3401844 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3401845 the democrats have nominated a man who is a mere fad or meme win or lose they will have a horrible case of buyers remorse
3401846 must then elude capture long enough to establish her innocence
3401847 the journal seemed to be more interested in reaching out to sports properties
3401848 as we broaden the journalism and expand our coverage sports is certainly part of that
3401849 weve been covering sports for a long time in a variety of ways but were really starting to turn up the volume on that
3401850 ondanks de toezegging van president dmitri medvedev dat het russische leger orders heeft gekregen zijn militaire interventie in georgi te staken bombarderen russische vliegtuigen nog altijd georgische doelen

3401854 oh man i hate to hear that monica she sure put up a good fight
3401855 we couldnt wait to get this started were sick of practice
3401856 i wouldve been hard pressed to come up with an example where electronic wedding invitations would be acceptable except when real life intervenes
3401857 in the past i never would have thought to use an electronic invitation because i dont know if it was as much of a formality as it was about brand awareness and being so protective over how the brand was portrayed
3401858 image was so important the paper stock the font we would have invitation designers and wed go through multiple edits
3401859 people always wanted to speak to the hostess when they made a reservation at a restaurant now they just use opentable
3401860 there was a whole segment of event types that people just did not want to use electronic invitations for
3401861 id like to believe that because of how we do things you also get the aesthetic aspect of it you dont have to sacrifice it
3401862 not having to use paper is huge when youre trying to be eco conscious
3401863 its better for the environment its cheaper if not free and youre collecting the majority of your rsvps in a place where theres no human error people either hit yes no or maybe and itll download into a list
3401864 there are always ways to do paper invitations in a cost effective way
3401865 you can get paper print them yourself hand write them
3401866 that point is actually quite well taken because it does create quite a lot of paper waste what might be interesting is to see if there are people or companies that come up with very low impact ways of generating invitations that are either easily recyclable or directly reusable
3401867 if you really know your guests and you really know its a preference for them i think thats great
3401868 at new york fashion week youve got 12 days of shows and events and its highly highly competitive
3401869 if you dont send out a paper invitation it doesnt work theres something about it landing on someones desk and having it be tactile
3401870 a large not quite a quarter yet but about 20 percent of our events are actually wedding related
3401871 i had no idea little girls could scream so loud

3401879 little yang peiyis failure to be selected was mainly because of her appearance because we were concerned with the interests of the nation
3401880 what does it mean to say you are worried about image seven year old girls are all little angels why say this its really ridiculous
3401881 thats bullshit any little boy or girl who is not so good looking and sees such an explanation will sob their heart out
3401882 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi that is to say we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation in our teams view combined together

3401888 next to bagel heads on the parkway and i can count 6 to 7 new major construction developments along that way thats pretty impressive especially during a slow economy that tallahassee is still able to move forward and progress
3401889 thats why im glad finals are in the morning because you wake up you race and youre not sitting around thinking about it all day
3401890 i was totally clear not too many nerves excited but pretty calm it almost didnt feel like the olympic games that was probably good in a sense
3401891 you hype it up so much in your head and then you get out there and youre like wow this is just another meet im here to do the same thing
3401892 but at the same time that was still a dream come true for me just to be able to race in the games
3401893 the first one is always the worst one to get under your belt im just glad that one is over with
3401894 im right where i need to be it was tough race but i know theres a little bit more in there
3401895 it was definitely difficult because last night was a finals situation
3401896 i really didnt have the focus i did yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat ive got more races ahead of me that are more important
3401897 i just wanted to get to the semifinals and not make the same mistakes as athens so i went out hard
3401898 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3401899 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning
3401900 im fourth knowing that at the end i slowed down a bit so everythings cool
3401901 it was hard after losing the race yesterday but afterwards i realized i am happy with the silver medal
3401902 i was so excited the whole day it was just truly spectacular
3401903 now we need to move on and swim fast i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing

3401943 since 1884 weve had a roll call vote its a nominating convention not a coronation
3401944 i dont think theres any harm in nominating sen clinton at the convention
3401945 it will acknowledge the success we had and it will give an opportunity for people to express themselves and get behind obama and win in november
3401946 its a simple thing to do and its the biggest sign of party unity
3401947 if we do that one thing the hillary people can get past it and move on
3401948 if the situation were reversed the obama people would feel the same
3401949 for the first time in a generation its been a close election and this was such a unique situation
3401950 sen clinton is going to do everything she can to make sure sen obama is the next president and that will include how the convention is handled and the role she plays
3401951 polls out there show that older women are the potential swing demographic in this election
3401952 it helps obama and the party to have her play a prominent role in the convention
3401953 if a candidates got delegates then both names can be placed in nomination
3401954 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
3401955 were democrats were precinct captains were fundraisers were the kind of democrats obama will need to win in november
3401956 if she releases us for the sake of party unity fine
3401957 but she hasnt done that the campaigns are talking and i respect they need to come to an agreement that makes both sides happy

3402168 but it caught ray marquette a sportswriter for the indianapolis star in the side of his head and knocked his glasses off ray had stepped in trying to play peacemaker

3402174 the evolution of networking and it technologies toward online it and the digital age creates significant opportunities for communications service providers csps but also poses huge challenges
3402175 opportunities for new digital services range from extended transmission services to content services and it services the main challenges will be a much more competitive environment and a much more intense use of it in the delivery of services by csps
3402176 the price of mobile data services and devices is too high for mass usage today so through 2012 carriers need to devise a better road map with new mobile digital services that require less bandwidth but offer users good value for money
3402177 in other words carriers need to focus on services with functions and features that users are willing to pay for download and streaming services for music files small payment mechanisms and ticket ordering services are examples of services that carriers need to offer

3402180 the demand for mini notebooks will be driven by several factors by their small form factor and small screen their light weight their price their ease of use and their basic but sufficient pc functionality
3402181 mini notebooks are likely to attract a variety of users with different usage scenarios content consumption internet browsing e mail instant messaging im keeping in touch with friends and family storing and sharing pictures and so on potential users are likely to include both first time buyers seeking a low cost introductory pc as well as experienced users seeking a low cost second or third pc for themselves or a relative
3402182 mini notebooks create opportunities to reach some new pc buyers and expand within existing buyers across all regions
3402183 considering the majority of mini notebooks will be sold to consumers pc vendors will need to pay increasing attention to the design and ease of use of mini notebooks these will be two crucial factors in this segment
3402184 for consumer mini notebooks to succeed they need to be positioned differently than standard notebooks and pc vendors will need to decide if the existing channels to market are appropriate and possibly look for new channels such as telecom gadget shops and so on
3402185 pc vendors will have to convince retailers to take on those products as they are still emerging products and potentially present some risk from an inventory point of view

3402349 the family on holiday from cheshire had attempted to launch the inflatable into heavy seas against locals warnings but the dinghy kept flipping over and the launch was aborted
3402350 they soon got into difficulties when one of the light alloy paddles snapped battling against the swell
3402351 the father jumped into the sea to retrieve the paddle but the dinghy was rapidly swept away from him further out to sea
3402352 by this time the father had been swept by the incoming tide onto the rocks between wisemans bridge beach and amroth beach
3402353 the child had come out of the boat and was struggling in the water
3402354 even when spoken to the enormity of their folly was not comprehended
3402355 anyone using these inflatables should treat them as only toys and not for serious journeys
3402356 always heed warnings on local weather and never attempt to launch such a flimsy boat in anything but flat calm conditions and then with someone holding onto it

3402358 lose weight the hard way no thanks ill just compress my flab and strap it in with manmade materials
3402359 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3402360 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3402361 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3402362 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3402363 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3402364 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3402365 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3402366 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3402367 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point
3402368 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve

3402419 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3402420 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3402421 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3402422 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3402423 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3402424 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors

3402426 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
3402427 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
3402428 the american academy of pediatrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run

3402543 but every year we have finished only a few points off the top six so this year our aim is to get into the top six

3402546 we want players that want to play for us and do everything they can for the team
3402547 i thought they snodgrass and robinson had fantastic second half debuts

3402595 t he historical once only nominal award of damages the anton pillar order structure is inapplicable in the case of a group of defendants whose continuous and blatantly recidivist infringing activities have taken place over a period of three years if a plaintiff was only entitled to a single award of damages under the nominal damages scale for multiple occasions of infringement then once a defendant was found liable for infringement the defendant would essentially be immune from liability for damages for all subsequent infringements
3402596 in my view the evidence is clear that both before and following the commencement of this action the defendants w lee w lee corporation ngan and tran have acted willfully and knowingly in violation of the plaintiffs rights in the trademarks and copyrights i agree with plaintiffs counsels submission that an award of statutory damages at the highest end of the scale that in the amount of 20 000 per each of the copyrighted works infringements is appropriate
3402597 we are extremely pleased by this precedent setting victory in our global fight against counterfeiting particularly in canada where the legal framework for the enforcement of intellectual property rights is not as strong as in other countries todays ruling by the supreme court follows the precedent set in our victory against lin pi chu yang which represented the largest ever default judgment in a canadian counterfeiting case in both cases louis vuitton used an innovative approach to calculating profits and damages to ensure the amounts awarded would be sufficient to serve as both punishment for violations in these cases and deterrence against future counterfeiting activities we are delighted that these important decisions reflect that both the federal court of canada and the supreme court of british columbia recognize the importance of protecting both trademarks and copyrights through these decisions the judges have sent a strong message to counterfeiters that their illegal activities will not be tolerated by the canadian courts
3402598 he pasado de jugar con rivales que son 400 del mundo a enfrentarme al n mero uno eso es inolvidable

3402692 we are going to look back with a similar bemusement at the pound trading at 2 10 and the euro above 1 60 and the australian dollar near parity with the u s dollar
3402693 i dont think people have bought into the idea that the dollar is in a longer term trend upward against the euro
3402694 over the past several months whenever commodity prices went up the dollar tended to depreciate now its going the other way
3402695 if you see commodity prices coming off more at least some dollar appreciation will be reflected
3402696 its very rare for the fed to talk about the value of the dollar
3402697 theyre better off investing in china singapore australia possibly thailand and malaysia certainly india as those growth rates are much higher
3402698 u s growth will probably be sideways for a number of quarters to come rates should stay on hold which should limit the amount of dollar appreciation from here

3402700 judges fear ruling in any way that could be seen as going against correa
3402701 its a legal absurdity but its real to say that in this instance we are going to lose
3402702 i dont see a lot of future in appealing either
3402703 chevron was the company that built all the well sites all the production stations and employed a system that had as a waste disposal mechanism of dumping this water in the amazon waterway
3402704 it is intellectually dishonest to put blinders on and blame everything on a company that left 17 years ago
3402705 it is as if you gave me a car 17 years ago and i put no oil it and did no maintenance and came back to you and said you owe me a new car
3402706 once we get a judges ruling we are not going to wait for the appeals we are going to collect the money through a u s court
3402707 they thought the case will never end and its going to
3402708 i think we will get a favorable judgment out of here next year
3402709 senator obama continues to believe that this is a matter for the ecuadorian judicial system to adjudicate in a fair impartial and independent manner
3402710 we will be more than happy to come to a real court in the u s and expose the cases irregularities
3402711 what we are seeing now is a collision between a much higher level of political and social sensibilities and older legal regimes
3402712 this has made companies like chevron potentially liable under local laws
3402713 although the government cant interfere in the judicial matter we totally support the claim of our compatriots
3402714 the world needs to know what this company texaco did
3402715 judges fear ruling in any way that could be seen as going against correa
3402716 they know they can lose their position and that they can be called traitor to the country
3402717 for us what the press and public opinion say doesnt exist
3402718 the court despite being ecuadorian has the freedom to resolve according to what the judge considers is fair
3402719 the pollution is result of chevrons actions and not of petroecuador

3402732 todo el modelo econ mico argentino est dependiendo de las commodities y si caen los precios todos los argentinos vamos a tener un escenario mucho m s duro
3402733 una ca da en el precio de las commodities afectar a severamente el resultado fiscal global
3402734 estado gastando a cuenta de precios internacionales que pueden mostrar una agachada luego de que la soja llegara a trepar alrededor de 100 interanual hace poco tiempo
3402735 una ca da de ingresos no s lo complicar a financiar este ritmo de gasto y continuar con los subsidios sino que adem s aumentar a a n m s la brecha financiera de 2009
3402736 una ca da de los precios de las commodities agr colas complicar a seriamente al gobierno porque hoy hay escasos recursos el a o pasado cerraron las cuentas nicamente por haber utilizado los fondos de las afjp y este a o tuvieron que utilizar transferencias del banco central obviamente que la luz de alerta est encendida
3402737 si argentina se conf a en los precios altos de las commodities para aumentar el gasto como lo viene haciendo vamos a estar en muy serios problemas lo advierto desde ahora
3402738 en este escenario seria imperioso para el gobierno modificar su pol tica de subsidios para alcanzar un super vit primario por encima del 2 del pib
3402739 cada 10 que cae el precio de las commodities del sector agr cola el estado se pierde de recaudar 1 000 m de d lares
3402740 si a esto se le suman los 11 000 m que podr a llegar a costarle al estado el inminente paquete de jubilaciones y asignaciones familiares al super vit primario de 2009 habr a que restarle en total 1 5 del pbi
3402741 esta ca da del 20 con la volatilidad que existe hoy en los mercados con stocks bajos es un escenario probable en a os con stocks altos donde las sorpresas no tienen elevados efectos sobre el balance de oferta y demanda este tipo de oscilaciones ser a dif cil que suceda pero actualmente no hay que descartar un escenario con bajas
3402742 a m s tardar a principios del a o que viene se va a comenzar a experimentar una importante baja del precio de las commodities
3402743 ha habido una confusi n general de relacionar el alza con la demanda de los pa ses de asia pero este no fue para nada el factor m s importante
3402744 desde 2001 a esta parte el d lar perdi m s del 60 de su valor por eso en la medida en que la fed intente combatir las presiones inflacionarias va a tender a apreciar el d lar y nos guste o no y por m s que haya mucha demanda en asia esto va a generar el efecto inverso en las commodities
3402745 hay que ir trabajando con un escenario con ca das del orden del 15 sumado a cantidades de productos exportados que dif cilmente aumenten el a o pr ximo por eso el escenario de 2009 se presenta m s conservador y mucho m s moderado
3402746 cuando tantas historias de fundamentals diferentes se mueven al mismo tiempo la raz n es una historia financiera o sea
3402747 a partir de la restricci n presupuestaria el gobierno se va a ver obligado a ahorrar para no entrar en default evidentemente no va a ser tan f cil sostener los subsidios al sector privado
3402748 las tarifas van a tener que moverse y van a subir
3402749 impactando de lleno en los bolsillos de los consumidores y empresas
3402750 esto es lo que est pasando con la luz y con el gas
3402751 habr menos transferencias a las provincias para obra p blica
3402752 al gobierno no le va a quedar m s remedio que disminuir los subsidios y para eso indefectiblemente no le va a quedar otra salida que seguir aumentando las tarifas durante lo que queda del a o y 2009 y esto en un menor contexto de crecimiento de la econom a
3402753 si bajan las commodities tendr amos una ca da de la balanza comercial un corrimiento hacia arriba del tipo de cambio y esto generar a una presi n inflacionaria que de no controlarse adecuadamente continuar a afectando al bolsillo
3402754 el ajuste de tarifas permitir reducir gastos y los ingresos se acelerar n tras haberse normalizado la actividad agropecuaria
3402755 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3402756 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3402757 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3402758 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3402759 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3402760 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3402761 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3402762 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3402763 just as you wouldnt expect to see a tobacco ad on a kids site or show there shouldnt be junk food ads there either
3402764 while there are some rules for tv there are no rules when you move online
3402765 we dont want to reduce junk food advertising to kids on tv and then find that it has just moved to another platform
3402766 with social networking marketers are getting the kids to create the ads and share them with their friends
3402767 it is incredibly sticky and it is viral regulators need to understand that
3402768 the report finds that although there is room for improvement the food and beverage industries have made significant progress
3402769 the cost of reaching and engaging a lot more kids is a lot less than the cost of what it is to buy a 30 second television ad
3402770 they are using a powerful arsenal of tools to target children and adolescents so they can engage in these unhealthy eating behaviors
3402771 to show that the government needs to regulate this advertising to improve childrens diets would be pretty tough
3402772 we think that companies can act on a self regulatory basis much more quickly than the government can
3402773 listen up fellow parents when we point a collective finger three more are pointing right back at us
3402774 when will we stop playing the victim and start taking personal responsibility for our kids health and eating habits

3402799 we knew that converting such a large set of data would require a flexible efficient solution which could provide utmost precision in the transformation process
3402800 with such diversity in end user requirements for this data we really needed an online solution that could enable these users regardless of their geodetic background to be able to reproject their own data
3402801 fme server makes it possible for our gis department to provide transformation as web services without the need for complicated time consuming development
3402802 now spatial data users across all departments will be able to convert their spatial data as needed so they can efficiently share it with other departments and government agencies
3402803 but with the prices weve been seeing and the widespread ability to irrigate corn producer expectations of income from the crop have risen dramatically in the last two to three years
3402804 its much the same with soybeans were seeing some fairly large gross income numbers for the crop compared to five or six years ago
3402805 there has been a fairly significant downward trend for cotton as the market has tried to absorb whats going on in all the commodity sectors
3402806 in 2009 and beyond it seems reasonable to expect quite a bit of support for cotton prices
3402807 in terms of where the markets are now we could see quite a bit of improvement in cotton prices looking at the 2009 10 marketing year
3402808 futures prices for all crops are high as far out as contracts are traded its really remarkable and says a lot about what the market thinks about future demand and use
3402809 the expectations in recent months are that these prices will be supported for the next two or three years
3402810 were seeing on farm storage continuing to increase in the mid south and once that infrastructure is in place it could work in favor of a more lasting shift into grains
3402811 its expected production will be down a lot from last year with not much change in usage so everybodys looking for a tight balance sheet which should provide very strong support for prices
3402812 i would guess there will be a lot of soybeans next year

3402847 allison has a special gift of looking at questions from new perspectives and recognizing relationships that others have either overlooked or missed all together
3402848 this ability has enabled her to make a couple of key breakthroughs as a graduate student that have stumped other scientists for decades
3402849 one symptom of an infected tomato or potato plant with this bacterium is yellowing of the foliage
3402850 the saliva of the tomato psyllid has been known to cause yellowing of tomato and potato leaves the cause of this symptom has been a mystery for over a century
3402851 what we know is that the bacterium is vectored by the tomato potato psyllid into their tomato and potato host plants subsequently causing yellowing and death to the plant
3402852 this knowledge may help growers come up with alternative strategies for controlling this pest were now working in the lab to confirm whether candidatus liberibacter psyllaurous is the psyllid yellows causing bacterium
3402853 chinese farmers call the young infected yellowing shoots of citrus yellow dragons because of the symptoms this disease causes in the plant
3402854 liberibacter psyllaurous could be a good model system to come up with methods for combating citrus greening disease
3402855 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3402856 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3402857 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3402858 this is chinese territory you have to obey the rules

3402897 i tried to take it out quite hard because people have been taking it out quite fast here so i didn t want to fall behind
3402898 i did get a bit tired in the second hundred but i managed to hold on at least it was a close race there between neil and i its going to be another close race tomorrow again
3402899 the atmosphere is incredible there s no way you can swim slowly in this place
3402900 i would like to think that it wasnt gamesmanship and it was for genuine reasons
3402901 i was surprised he only broke me once and i think it went quite well
3402902 i was happy with the race the tactics were to try and rattle the japan team by going off fast but they white and mccann just couldnt match the power
3402903 this has been great experience for kirsten she has grown substantially this week
3402904 i want to win the c final then the b in 2012 and then aim for a place in a final in 2016
3402905 we played so well we didnt leave a big space for them
3402906 its tough for us playing in a tough pool with tough team but thats what you have to expect scraping in to the olympics as a low ranked team
3402907 it was really tough playing against china their counter attacks are just lethal and they are fast i think its difficult for any team to catch up with them
3402908 this is the end of my career although it wasnt a good fight i went through a lot of pain its the end of amateur boxing i m going to turn professional
3402909 pero me preocupa que se meta esa gente de miami

3402914 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3402915 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3402916 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3402917 fao greatly appreciates nigerias swift reporting and sharing of the relevant information about this new virus strain
3402918 es geht heute bei der frage der motorisierung unseres politischen spitzenpersonals nur vordergr ndig um symbolik politiker haben eine vorbildfunktion und bestimmen deshalb mit dar ber welche autos morgen gekauft werden us amerikanische starlets und pop ikonen sind an diesem punkt erheblich weiter als j rgen r ttgers der noch nicht einmal auskunft dar ber geben will welche autos er f hrt

3402923 viele brauchen hilfe im umgang mit den beh rden zum beispiel bei aufenthaltsgenehmigungen oder sozialleistungen
3402924 viele migranten machen bei uns ihren einstieg in die deutsche sprache
3402925 dieses b rgerschaftliche engagement ist neben der interkulturellen ffnung also dem aufeinanderzugehen unterschiedlicher kulturen unser hauptziel
3402926 unsere mitarbeiter werden geschult um migranten entsprechend ihres kulturellen hintergrunds betreuen zu k nnen

3402929 i get asked about beyonce all the time but i try and make fun of it
3402930 sometimes i say shes not my sister other times i say ive stuffed her in my suitcase and sent it to dubai
3402931 i have to have fun with it or ill turn into britney shave my head and go totally crazy
3402932 i get a lot of wrinkled noses because of how outspoken i am
3402933 it is our clear position and this position is strengthened after the russian violations that it was a big mistake made by allies that georgia and ukraine did not get the membership action plan in bucharest
3402934 we think russia got this message as a green light and mostly the recent steps we have in the territory of georgia come from this mistake
3402935 i thought he was someone wanting to join us and as he came closer he called to us so we stopped and waited for him
3402936 suddenly he produced a gun forced us down a path and at the end of the path he demanded our cellphones and ordered us to take off our pants
3402937 i want to prove they have made a big mistake i dont think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here
3402938 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds i am waiting
3402939 last week the lssas council members issued a statement expressing grave concern at the unrelenting improper and thoughtless attacks on the judiciary and other institutions of justice in recent weeks
3402940 also the lssa represents attorneys of all races with its six constituent members being the four statutory provincial law societies the black lawyers association and the national association of democratic lawyers
3402941 the notes show tojo kept his died in the wool militarist mentality until the very end
3402942 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120
3402943 we are now on a course for a humiliating peace or rather a humiliating surrender
3402944 many soldiers and the people cannot bring themselves to die until the goal is achieved
3402945 now that the diplomatic steps have been taken after the emperors judgment i have decided to refrain from making any comments about it though i have a separate view
3402946 moral responsibility for causing useless deaths even though they were meant to be sacrifice for a great cause
3402947 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3402948 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3402949 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3402950 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3402951 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3402952 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3402953 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3402954 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3402955 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3402956 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging environment
3402957 but regional economic integration is not only about the removal of tariff barriers
3402958 the launch of the fta is not an end in itself but the beginning of a process we need to embark on to build both our productive and trade capacity improve the competitiveness of our industries and address the supply side constraints that inhibit us from benefiting from better terms of trade in the region we need to focus on expanding our agriculture a strong industrial drive is essential in promoting structural change
3402959 we shall have to attend in addition to those issues about expanding our productive capabilities and trade and so on we shall have to attend to the question of infrastructure cross border or regional infrastructure if you like
3402960 we have raised those concerns because we are genuinely concerned about the impact of the epas on regional integration
3402961 that must say something about the participation of zimbabwe in trade within the region
3402962 the idea is to help presidents and chancellors promote the game environment initiative to these important campus community and public constituents
3402963 as the national spotlight focuses on sportsmanship and other game day concerns we want division ii leaders to be able to tell their local and regional audiences about their own efforts to foster a positive family friendly atmosphere at division ii athletics events
3402964 ncaa division ii presidents and chancellors affirm that athletics events should reflect the values of higher education and the mission of each institution division ii emphasizes learning and development in a personal setting as chancellors and presidents we are concerned about the uncivil behavior exhibited at college athletics contests and thereby pledge to work together to make respectful family friendly events a standard of the division ii experience
3402965 we posted an article saying that the sprint variant of the touch diamond may launch this month but now we have slightly different information first htc touch diamond will be called htc victor for sprint and htc diamond for verizon sprints variant runs on qualcomm 7501a chipset with 528mhz processor 256mb rom 256mb ram and 4gb internal memory verizons runs on qualcomm 7500 chipset with 400mhz processor has half the ram 128mb and has microsd cards slot instead of 4gb nand flash the cdma equivalent of the htc touch pro will be called htc herman for sprint and htc raphael for verizon they are qwerty variants of respectively the victor and the diamond and have similar specifications but twice the rom memory 512mb for both herman trades victors 4gb for memory card slot and raphaels frame is also made out of aluminum instead of steel a few of our readers report that the victor will be available with sprint on september 02 2008 and the herman will come one month later there is no exact information when verizon wireless will release the diamond and the raphael but it is expected that sprint will have 30 days exclusivity
3402966 a lot of people wanted to come and have a drink with a nice view of the square
3402967 if it aint from the 82 90 joe line of toys or from the sunbow cartoon i dont want it
3402968 we now have a better idea of where these brain tumors come from and their relationship to normal stem cells in the brain
3402969 medulloblastoma was one of the first tumors that was believed to fit the hypothesis that tumors are caused by cancer stem cells that initiate malignancies and sustain them
3402970 but the prevailing hypothesis that medulloblastomas originate from non stem cells just did not make perfect sense with this
3402971 there must be susceptibility factors in the granule neuron precursor cell that predispose it to forming cancer so we now must try to understand what it is about this cell type that makes it susceptible to forming cancer in response to sonic hedgehog signaling this relationship between stem cells and oncogenes suggests a new point of potential therapeutic intervention
3402972 our struggle for complete independence from india will continue no power on earth can deter us from achieving this
3402973 its a do or die for us india can take as many lives of kashmiris as it can but it must leave
3402974 fifa is closely monitoring the situation in georgia we are in regular contact with both member associations concerned for that match however at this time it is too early to speculate on any possibilities
3402975 we advise everyone to stay off the ground because you can be evicted and also face heavy fines
3402976 its for the safety of both players and supporters we would say to everyone stay off the ground
3402977 im sure it will happen but to what magnitude im not sure
3402978 its tradition and im sure a lot would remember the jason dunstall days and just run out there
3402979 im pretty sure that at least half the cheer squad would jump the fence and run out
3402980 because i run it ive got to try and do security in the cheer squad but in saying that i cant hold everybody back
3402981 conditions involving everyones safety including people who run on the ground is an issue so we would be encouraging people not to do it
3402982 obviously we have to make plans in case some people decide to do it
3402983 one would hope people wouldnt jump the fence and be silly
3402984 there is a substantial fine if people enter the playing arena hopefully the public will respect the security presence because you dont want any of them to be hurt or any of the players
3402985 but if a few do jump the fence we will go into a security and police procedure just to make sure the players and officials are safe on the oval
3402986 fast eyes moving all the time that means a quick thinker
3402987 when we first went over to china for one international trip every four years we actually played against the shanghai sports school
3402988 i watched him train his team the one thing he definitely brings as an assistant i dont have to explain to him how you train a setter or outside hitter
3402989 if theyre absolute top tier theyre not even going to get a passport
3402990 if theyre at that level their best options are right there
3402991 their sophistication in the sport is usually at a higher level because theyre kind of on that sports track
3402992 theyve shown some promise in sports and theyve been groomed to excel athletically others are groomed to be a musician or an artist others who have shown great promise in math they are groomed in that area
3402993 if you have shown some promise or have bloodlines youll be pushed that way
3402994 in china we spent a lot of time on building skills
3402995 they learn technique for three years before they can actually compete
3402996 we had somebody from a smaller area in china they were denied a visa by the united states shanghai is easier beijing a little more difficult beijing has so many high profile people in various fields that the visa allotment gets used up a place like shanghai it seems like it functions like any other western city capitalism is ok there
3402997 two more are in graduate school and working one for sure intends to go back once she gets her graduate degree
3402998 one of the biggest problems at every university for example is drinking for undergraduates
3402999 drinking is just not a big deal they could have done it at any time thats not a big part of their lifestyle they seem to be more balanced they want to go out and see a movie or go dancing occasionally but it doesnt consume their life theyre here to serve a purpose not looking to get away from mom and dad and go crazy
3403000 the international connection has helped our program really attracting higher talented individuals
3403001 it would be difficult to attract that same level of talent in the united states theres just more competition for those players this was an avenue that fit for our university and our city we have such a melting pot
3403002 in china a lot of players go to sports schools
3403003 so we focus a lot on whichever sport we practice the coaches are very intense in china they dont give us many breaks we have to obey the coach or else we will get in trouble we only focus on one skill at a time so we can master that skill
3403004 i wish i could be there but i will be in preseason
3403005 there are a lot more people in shanghai philadelphia is more dangerous than shanghai the stores are always open late at night in shanghai so people stay out later and it is much safer
3403006 we dont do shuffle steps or anything like in america we cross over our feet because its faster
3403007 they have very good schools in shanghai just like ivy schools
3403008 but the education is better here in the united states the education in china focuses on books and themes here they focus on working abilities
3403009 you even have recruiting services that are basically scouting and giving out names on the international athletes including in china
3403010 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
3403011 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
3403012 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
3403013 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
3403014 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
3403015 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
3403016 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
3403017 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
3403018 in a nutshell i think motorola may have hit the bottom and is now on the rebound

3403020 were going to continue our theme from last year farming for the 21st century but look at new topic areas
3403021 technology is changing so fast and were trying out a lot of new technologies here at the farm
3403022 the cost of irrigating fields has really gone up with higher fuel costs the cost of pumping water is what were really concerned about so we decided wed better talk about that at the field day
3403023 it looks like its going to be a pretty quick season
3403024 even now im still in touch with a number of former team mates although theyre scattered across the globe these days i still maintain very close contact with giovane elber and krassimir balakov
3403025 ill never forget my first bundesliga appearance 19 august 1994 for vfb stuttgart when i scored a last minute winner against hamburg definitely the worst moment was losing the european cup winners cup final to chelsea in 1998 although nowadays id say taking part in the final was one of the highlights of my career
3403026 i have a real fondness for all my former clubs im still really interested in how theyre getting on although the strongest attachment was always to vfb stuttgart and thats not changed at all
3403027 jurgen klinsmann called me and we had a very good conversation characterised by great mutual respect during our chat i acknowledged the consequences of the course he intended to pursue he set off in exactly the right direction with the national team
3403028 the team is developing nicely and will definitely be among the favourites in south africa we have very good youngsters and very experienced senior players will it be enough for the trophy its much too early to make predictions two years are an eternity in football
3403029 following the football scene from the media perspective is really interesting and something you can never appreciate as a player the way a live broadcast works is really impressive team play is just as important as it is on the field of play just like the game the playmaker cant win it on his own
3403030 im always on the move just like before but my three girls have never had it any other way so just as i did in the past i try and set aside every free minute i have for the family you dont get anywhere without them
3403031 i cant see myself in the job although i have plenty of experience after playing under so many different coaches but fredi bobic in the dug out its not going to happen my mid term goal is to work somewhere in club management set up
3403032 i was a professional footballer everything else is just an encore
3403033 non verranno usati solamente questi filmati in animazione per narrare il gioco molto spesso ci saranno situazioni narrative ingame per mantenere il giocatore immerso nelluniverso di gioco
3403034 it sounds like people will have to create a rolling list of people they follow
3403035 we are doing all the things the midp was designed for we are exporting we are creating a lot of employment we are designing and we are adding value locally
3403036 at this point in time the midp is very focused on passenger and light commercial and there is very little consideration being given to the top end we are doing all the right things and we really hope we are given a chance to participate
3403037 we are not finished with it the midp just yet we are looking with the hope of participating in the new restructured midp process coming up
3403038 but its very much under the cloak at dti indications are that it will finalise the plans in the following week but its being done very much in isolation
3403039 we have increased our labour force in south africa by 20 this year but are still not supported to anywhere near the same degree as many of our foreign competitors we urge government at national provincial and local level to heed our call to assist us with globally competitive supply side support measures

3403062 the celebration of the independence day of india the worlds largest democracy in the heart of boston the cradle of liberty will be an enjoyable and memorable family event we expect over 15 000 people to attend this year
3403063 the prime attraction at this india day celebration is the cultural program presented by talented local performers it will include colorful and vibrant dance numbers music items bollywood dances traditional regional and modern folk dances as well as classical dance styles like bharatanatyam and odissi and high energy folk dances like the garba gidda and bhangra

3403065 i was certainly encouraged to hear the speaker last night suggest a willingness to allow the house to have an up or down vote on the merits of unlocking the potential of americas abundant energy resources but the proof will be in the proverbial pudding
3403066 house republicans have already made our position clear a position that includes remaining on the floor of the u s house to demand a genuine debate and straightforward vote on the most important issue facing americans today despite what we heard last night the speakers position is far from clear but she could clear that up by bringing the house back into session and working with republicans to pass a serious energy plan to bring down prices at the pump
3403067 i am not buying the lie that sacrificing the arctic national wildlife refuge and americas coastal waters to oil drilling would make a real difference in gas prices either today or twenty years from today
3403068 with just three percent of the worlds oil reserves our nation simply doesnt have enough oil to impact the global market or drill our way to lower prices at the pump

3403134 working hard in developmental camp and training camp are my top priorities since im out to try and make their decision to send me back home to junior a hard one
3403135 i really didnt know what to expect coming in but its been a lot of fun just to come down here meet some of the guys in the system meet the coaching staff and just kind of see the facilities i know im still young and i have to work my way up but its something that im definitely going to work hard at hopefully ill be able to play my game while helping the team out as much as i can
3403136 developmental camp was a crazy week for our coaches with all the players here but we did have some instructional meetings in the locker room
3403137 they just tried to stress the importance of playing good sound defense and to always keep your feet moving its something where im definitely going to concentrate on adding those aspects into my game on a consistent basis and hopefully theyll be satisfied
3403138 im out to be the best all around defenseman possible
3403139 i like to take care of defense first and then chip in offensively when needed but really i just want to be a good team player capable of sticking up for teammates and myself while trying to help out the team in any way
3403140 ive trained with daniel briere philadelphia daniel alfredsson ottawa and matt bradley washington and that was something ill never forget
3403141 itll be pretty crazy watching players i admired growing up bearing down on me and playing against them itll be a great experience
3403142 at camp the guys who were drafted really took it to the next level and even though many arent in the nhl yet the pace was much faster and the players were a lot quicker and stronger its interesting to see where i fit in among the group
3403143 i suppose im fitting in because the guys around here are starting to call me chuck norris
3403144 i guess they feel i look a little like him that was the funny thing around camp all week
3403145 tobias made a good impression and has really done well for himself and itll be great to have a chance to play on a team with a guy like that
3403146 i think the team and fans of atlanta are really looking forward to moving ahead this coming season and obviously management has made some changes that we all hope will pay off

3403189 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3403190 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3403191 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3403192 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3403193 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers

3403195 it was confirmed that previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects as in many other big events
3403196 on the day of the ceremony there were actual footprints of fireworks from the south to the north of the city however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded footage may have been used

3403208 yahoo strongly believes that consumers want choice when customizing their online experience and they have also demonstrated a strong preference for advertising that is more personally relevant to them

3403258 road mortality is a significant factor of influencing snake populations around the world
3403259 in southern alberta its particularly important because the snakes arent moving very fast across the roads and there is a huge amount of development
3403260 were trying to learn how we can design roads and plan for roadways that are going to have less of an impact on snakes
3403261 situations like this lead to a general sense of instability and so i think investors will have to weigh up chances of continuing problems in the region going forward
3403262 you wonder how much transportation risk has been mitigated or reduced by building infrastructure through more volatile regions but its too early to make that assessment just yet
3403263 the conflict should give second thoughts about seeing any region as the safe haven or the magic bullet type solution to energy security
3403264 if you look at the long war in chechnya that russia had again it had no measureable impact on the domestic growth scenario
3403265 and that was a long and a bad and a protracted war i dont really see this having any impact investors will look at it digest it and if they see that event has no impact on their investments they wont divest
3403266 one likely result is that the events will harden the resolve of those governments and companies who seek to bypass russia in extracting caspian resources

3403271 im hoping that there might be a harmony between the values of humor and morality

3403276 going to war with russia is bad for your creditworthiness to put it mildly
3403277 i dont think what has happened substantially changes the fundamentals for other countries but it may be a wake up call to some people who hadnt properly appreciated potential russian impact in the region
3403278 youd expect this to affect sentiment towards them as it is more evidence of russia trying to exert control over its nearest neighbours
3403279 a more aggressive russian foreign policy within the former soviet union is likely to pose a threat to ukrainian asset prices in due course
3403280 obviously people will also be looking at the former soviet republics with borders with russia
3403281 the big difference is that you do not have any particular disputed border regions except for a very small area of estonia or areas with a large russian population
3403282 a worsening in relations between russia and the west would put at risk russian supplies of gas to european countries
3403283 we estimate 4 1 million euros 6 1 million is needed the tower is very badly damaged
3403284 the tower is definitely a big symbol for berlin as a ruin its certainly the most important memorial for reconciliation in berlin and possibly in germany
3403285 there are other big buildings in berlin that cost a lot of money too and i think this one is more important than the new buildings
3403286 its about what the world war did to germany as well as the rest of europe i think its important to remember the heavy damage

3403314 there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today

3403342 that is a pretty amazing statistic but not so hard to understand given the intense marketing of psa testing for so many years
3403343 one thing that is often missing in the psa discussion is the level of risk men face this is of course crucial information how else can you weigh the potential benefits and known harms if you dont know your chances to begin with unfortunately the risk information isnt usually part of the discussion or when it is its usually given in aggregate terms for example you will read that 220 000 men were diagnosed last year or 28 000 died those numbers hide the fact that the risk changes dramatically with age the numbers also do not provide context ie competing risks of death for interpreting the risk
3403344 the paper shows how we developed risk charts which present the 10 year chance of death from various causes and all causes combined at different ages with regards to prostate cancer the charts show that for younger men there isnt a lot of risk to reduce with screening out of 1000 men less than 1 will die of prostate cancer in the next 10 years another way of saying that is more than 999 will not die of prostate cancer during this time

3403392 yo lo que le ofrezco al se or rodr guez zapatero es un consenso y un acuerdo en esta materia pero es su responsabilidad aceptar esta oferta que el partido popular le est haciendo
3403393 afecta a la propia estabilidad del psoe y por tanto a la propia estabilidad del gobierno en un momento de crisis econ mica
3403394 lo peor que nos puede pasar a todos los espa oles es que encima los apoyos del gobierno est n divididos
3403395 ha generado un l o muy importante dentro de su propio partido
3403396 le amenaza ahora con no apoyar los presupuestos generales del estado y hacer caer el gobierno
3403397 no era buena para los catalanes ni para el conjunto de espa a
3403398 y ahora continu el se or rodr guez zapatero con su actuaci n est enga ando a la gente una vez m s
3403399 es que cumpla lo que el propio rodr guez zapatero aprob
3403400 si el se or rodr guez zapatero lo aprueba y no lo cumple la pregunta habr que hac rsela a l
3403401 lo que ha sembrado zapatero no es bueno para espa a
3403402 en pol tica como en tantas y tantas facetas de la vida cada uno recoge lo que siembra y desgraciadamente lo que ha sembrado rodr guez zapatero como estamos viendo ahora no es nada bueno para espa a
3403403 a hablar a dialogar y a buscar un acuerdo entre todos
3403404 este espect culo que tiene como responsable al presidente del gobierno tiene que terminar
3403405 detta r sista chansen f r oss att f k pa v ra bost der
3403406 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3403407 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3403408 i dont think moscow will be in the mood not only to hold talks but even to speak to saakashvili
3403409 he has committed crimes against our citizens our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner hed better quit
3403410 bigger part of the operation to coerce the georgian side to peace in south ossetia
3403411 deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3403412 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3403413 we hope russia will join the broad consensus that is emerging that this has gone on for too long
3403414 implications for the region implications for the future relations of russia with the united states and the other international communities
3403415 for us the situation is not as simple as our american colleagues or our georgian colleagues would like us or others to see
3403416 our forces are continuing to take steps which would make sure that georgian forces do not have the ability to invade south ossetia again
3403417 their accounting is so distorted it recalls the phrase the big lie
3403418 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3403419 the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims

3403424 viread will be an important new treatment option and its approval represents a significant step forward in the fight against chronic hepatitis b
3403425 the approval of viread for hepatitis b represents more than a decade of work in both the fields of hiv and hepatitis b to develop a medication that offers significant viral suppression once daily dosing and a well established safety profile
3403426 we extend our thanks to the investigators and patients who participated in the clinical trials that support todays approval and we look forward to partnering with community members to increase disease awareness and expand access to treatment for those patients in need
3403427 although weve made great strides in reducing the overall incidence of chronic hepatitis b in the united states the disease still takes a devastating toll in asian american communities
3403428 greater public awareness and effective new treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce this significant health disparity
3403429 much but not all of the fiscal shortfall can be ameliorated by publishing every other week

3403504 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3403505 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make demands on whether he is the appropriate person

3403533 the most influential response to this situation is the one articulated by zbigniew brzezinski the dean of the democratic party foreign policy establishment going back to the jimmy carter regime and even earlier brzezinskis name is associated with a new strategy which calls for a de emphasis of the middle east in favor of a global approach to crushing the power of russia and china once and for all

3403539 todays cfls underscore mercurys volatile vapor form which is still a significant health concern ventilation reduces but does not eliminate this toxicant mercury vapor inhalation can cause significant neural damage in developing fetuses and children
3403540 with short excursions over 25 000 ng m3 sometimes over 50 000 ng m3 and possibly over 100 000 ng m3 from the breakage of a single compact fluorescent lamp
3403541 in a glass jar with a metal lid or in a sealed plastic bag
3403542 of the 12 different types of containers tested during the 23 different tests the plastic bag was found to be the worst choice for containing mercury emissions
3403543 based upon this study the dep now suggests that a glass container with metal screw lid with a gum seal be used to contain debris
3403544 all three flooring surfaces in this study pre finished hardwood short nap carpet and shag carpet were able to be cleaned up with pre study cleanup guidance so that they looked clean however mercury vapors emanating from all three surface types were detected especially when agitated for weeks after the cleanup of a break flooring surfaces once visibly clean can emit mercury immediately at the source that can be greater than 50 000 ng m3
3403545 flooring surfaces that still contain mercury sources emit more mercury when agitated than when not agitated this mercury source in the carpeting has particular significance for children rolling around on a floor babies crawling or non mobile infants placed on the floor
3403546 there are a number of studies documenting neurotoxicity as a consequence of inhalation of elemental mercury in adults studies documented changes in eeg deficits in peripheral nerve function autonomic effects psychological and sleep changes and deficits in fine motor performance visuomotor coordination visual reaction time visual scanning memory concentration and executive function
3403547 it is well established that the developing organism may be much more sensitive than the adult to neurotoxic agents for example methylmercury exposure can produce devastating effects in the fetus including cerebral palsy blindness deafness and even death while producing no or minimal effects in the mother
3403548 infants and toddlers also have a much higher rate of respiration than adults therefore they have a higher exposure to similar concentrations they also are lower to the floor and therefore closer to the source of the exposure and presumably more apt to obtain a concentrated dose of mercury
3403549 elderly and unhealthy individuals may already be at comprised health and be more susceptible to mercury effects than a healthy individual for example mercury does kidney damage which could exacerbate an already existing kidney disease

3403585 i have several 5 in total charges pending with eeoc and its been well over 2 years at this point im just amazed after filing my initial complaint of discrimination all forms of retaliation was a result threats denial of promotion termination and ineligibility to rehire i think what really pisses me off although i never trusted her was that the black hr director shes no longer in her role went along w the program hr was useless the companies internal eeo process was utterly useless when you file a internal eeo complaint the complaint is redirected to human resources fortunately their case is unraveling their written responses are not adding up to the documentation i submitted i documented everything and interesting enough this same hr director told me no amount of documentation will win over a manager of course all of this was reported to eeoc

3403611 most of the contacts i met on there were fellow doll collectors although i did meet a number of portraiture photographers in my early days too i love flickr because i have met so many close friends on there and without the support everyone has given me im certain i would have lost interest in photography and dropped the camera in a dusty corner years ago
3403612 it was the first time russian and ukrainian sides had met at such a level of competition we wanted to prove that we were stronger that it was unfair that after the break up of the ussr russia took all the leading players and the international coefficients it wasnt right dynamo and ukrainian players generally did more for the ussrs ranking than russians did

3403691 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers

3403694 over 70 percent of total global emissions are generated from cities and if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them
3403695 this is a vital step for city councils who wish to gain a better understanding of their own impact and by improving their understanding of risks and opportunities associated with climate change best prepare their cities for a carbon constrained world
3403696 icleis partnership with the carbon disclosure project underscores how crucial standards quantification methods and voluntary reporting are to local climate action
3403697 this project provides the opportunity for transparency and is essential in the emerging national and global policy dialogue as the priorities of local governments to achieve swift and deep reductions are identified and advanced by local government leaders
3403698 the city of new york joins the worlds leading corporations in providing a complete accurate accounting of its carbon emissions the strategies it is employing to mitigate those emissions and the results of its efforts through the carbon disclosure project and iclei

3403701 if the taser was indeed the cause of death this could be an interesting case
3403702 given the historical corruption of law enforcement in the area and the fact that the young man was tased nine times something is definitely wrong with this picture
3403703 we didnt get this negative reaction when nightsticks were used to split heads open but because of the technology and what it does the media have really exacerbated the issue of the taser
3403704 the upside of the taser far outweighs the unfortunate abuse or downside
3403705 were seeing injuries that wouldnt normally happen on a routine traffic stop and all of a sudden theyre happening
3403706 the taser in many cases is going to be safe but its those other cases which actually are prevalent in the population that police interact with that we have a lot of concerns about
3403707 although exposure is not risk free there is no conclusive medical evidence within the state of current medical research that indicates a high risk of serious injury or death from the direct effects of ced conducted energy device exposure
3403708 police sometimes do things theyre not supposed to do and if you put the temptation in front of them if you tell 100 police officers that heres your tasers and youre not supposed to use them to punish someone is going to use them to punish its predictable
3403709 its significant in the sense it shows how this young officer exceeded his authority and use of force and it shows how dangerous those tasers are the community wont rest until they see appropriate relief in regards to this situation
3403710 den f rsta tisdagen efter den f rsta m ndagen i november
3403711 si escuchas mil campanitas repicando sin control no te asustes ni a bella es que al verte a ti me retumba el coraz n al ritmo de una canci n

3403715 desearia ser una lagrima tuya para nacer en tus ojos vivir en tus mejillas y morir en tus labios
3403716 s que necesito el coraz n para vivir pero m s necesito a qui n lo hace latir

3403721 tienes que saber que te amo demasiado pero no s amarte menos
3403722 las flores al verte celosas est n no comprenden como una de ellas caminando va
3403723 si tu cuerpo fuera c rcel y tus brazos cadenas que bonito sitio para cumplir mi condena
3403724 viv sin conocerte y cuando te conoc comprend que no hab a vivido
3403725 amigo dile que ya no me importa dile que ya no lo quiero dile que no me acuerdo de l pero nunca le digas que mientras te dije esto estaba llorando
3403726 caer ante tus pies es la nica derrota que un hombre puede aceptar tener
3403727 te quiero porque te quiero porque te quiero querer porque siempre te he querido y nunca sabr por qu
3403728 nuestros caminos se separaron sin odio ni rencor pero como quieres que te llame amigo si alguna vez te dije amor
3403729 te quiero m s que a mi madre y siento que estoy pecando pues ella me dio la vida y t me la est s quitando
3403730 puede que no seas perfecto pero tus defectos son encantadores
3403731 c mo quieres que te olvide si cuando quiero olvidarte me olvido del olvido y comiezo a recordarte
3403732 entender no es solamente perdonar sino al final amar el amor no consiste en mirarse uno al otro si no en mirar juntos hacia la misma direcci n
3403733 del cielo cay un pintor para pintar tu figura pero no encontr pintura para tanta hermosura

3403742 si la luna es bonita mas bonito es el sol pero una mirada tuya no tiene comparaci n
3403743 la sonrisa de tus labios quita brillo al mundo entero pero qu me importa el mundo si yo tengo mi lucero
3403744 tal vez para el mundo s lo seas una persona pero para una persona eres el mundo
3403745 tienes hora es que quiero decirle a mi analista en que momento exacto me he vuelto loco
3403746 si tuviera que hacerte un regalo te regalar a un espejo porque despu s de ti lo m s bonito es tu reflejo
3403747 que bonitos ojos tienes tan redondos como el sol se parecen a los ceros que me pone el profesor
3403748 si amarte es pecado el infierno es todo m o
3403749 sabes qu es lo m s hermoso de mis ojos el reflejo de los tuyos
3403750 si tu eres coca cola y yo un hielito no me toques que me derrito
3403751 a veces me pregunto por qu la vida es tan bella ahora ya lo s porqu tu estas en ella
3403752 la vida sin ti no tiene sentidos por que mis cincos sentidos los tienes t
3403753 definitivamente la noche esta horrible es que tu belleza la opaca
3403754 entre tu y yo lo nico que esta mal es el aire que nos separa
3403755 al amor y a ti los conoci al mismo tiempo
3403756 bienaventurados los borrachos porque ellos te ver n dos veces
3403757 amor no es una palabra es una ciencia que estudia la mejor forma de ser feliz
3403758 si el universo tiene un sentido esta ahora frente a mi

3403763 we have a responsibility in saskatchewan to stop this before we add more problems to the problem of climate change
3403764 this is a very sad day for me especially as a youth for this day really for me signifies the beginning of no return
3403765 this has the potential to be a very large type of development but we are working to ensure its being done in a responsible fashion
3403766 the environmental footprint will be very very modest in comparison to what many people think of as traditional oilsands developments
3403767 if you went down to the estevan weyburn area and looked at a conventional well it would be very similar to what you would see in the northwest in a type of oilsands development there
3403768 most tar sands will still need water will still need energy
3403769 i dont how much different it will be i think we need to have again a full assessment of that well before we actually go ahead and make a decision on going ahead with it

3403807 da un punto di vista statico la guglia maggiore non presenta alcun problema anche perch in tal senso gi stata oggetto in passato di due importanti interventi a met dellottocento quando addirittura si era pensato di demolirla in seguito ad alcuni cedimenti e nel 1962 quando lintera struttura stata messa in sicurezza con fasciature e tiranti in acciaio inox il degrado della guglia maggiore riguarda soprattutto le superfici marmoree dellapparato decorativo c dunque il rischio di cadute e distacchi come abbiamo verificato nel corso dei periodici controlli da noi effettuati per questo non pi possibile rimandare tale intervento
3403808 linquinamento urbano ha senza dubbio le sue colpe ma in questo caso bisogna tener conto soprattutto della particolare esposizione atmosferica a cui soggetta la guglia pi alta de duomo con un fenomeno di erosione eolica davvero notevole tanto che il marmo sembra subire una sorta di scartavetratura lass a oltre cento metri di altezza gli sbalzi termici sono poi molto pi accentuati con conseguenze che alla lunga possono causare danneggiamenti di vario tipo

3403818 this was a prolonged episode of very dangerous driving at speeds of up to 130mph excessive speeds in built up areas and dangerous overtaking
3403819 it is clear to me that you were determined not to be apprehended because you knew that you were driving while disqualified
3403820 what ive seen so far is that jordan larson rachel schwartz and amanda gates understand what needs to be done in the offseason and summer and what it takes to be a great team
3403821 they have the experience of winning a title and have been a major part of our success over the years we are bringing in five new players and our seniors have been proactive in making them feel comfortable and helping to build relationships that are needed to be successful
3403822 our margin for error will be less than last year especially with the scoring change going from 30 points per set to 25
3403823 the thing i was most encouraged about during the spring was our ability to be an exceptional serving passing and defensive team
3403824 if we can pass the ball in system we have the hitters who can put the ball away we will have to rely on them and be better with our first contact
3403825 rachel and kayla are battling for the starting libero position and both will have chances to make significant contributions because of our personnel
3403826 rachel showed that she can play at a high level at either libero or defensive specialist over the last two years
3403827 she has a great opportunity to make a major impact on the success of our team and is looking forward to a strong senior year
3403828 the experience that kayla gained last year was valuable in her development
3403829 she was in a lot of meaningful matches for us at the end of the season and the game started to slow down for her we saw that during the spring when she was one of our best passers
3403830 one of the things we have looked at is moving kori to the m1 spot where she would be able to get more opportunities to attack
3403831 it would be a different role for her but it was something we worked on in the spring and it suited her well she had a great spring and continues to get better in all areas of her game
3403832 amanda is the hardest worker in our program and i dont think there is a more motivated player to be on the court in our program
3403833 she knows this is her senior year and her chance shes been backing up some great players and amanda will give everything she has for her senior season
3403834 brookes presence on the court was tremendous for a redshirt freshman in the spring
3403835 she communicates at a high level and works hard to get in position especially in transition and that is not an easy concept for freshmen to grasp she had more attempts than any of our middles in the spring because she wants the ball and she works hard to get good swings
3403836 when jordan got here last fall she was a little behind the others but has really worked hard to catch up
3403837 when we played her in the spring she did everything nearly perfect and has a much better understanding of our system she took a big step forward in the spring and has a chance to help us this year
3403838 allison is typical of many of the players in our program as she was an excellent multi sport athlete in high school who is just beginning to realize her volleyball potential
3403839 she has great jumping ability and is able to create angles that some of our players cant because of her athletic ability
3403840 she is our go to player now she has an opportunity to show that she can lead a team and that is something she has always wanted to do weve challenged her to be in the best shape of her career in order to physically carry that load and she is anxious to prove that she is one of the best players in the country
3403841 taras experience in the ncaa tournament will really help her understand what it takes to be successful at this level
3403842 she had a great spring and has built off of her freshman year tara has the potential to play at an all big 12 level this year
3403843 jordan is a well rounded volleyball player who has a live arm and good vision of the court
3403844 she will have an opportunity to work with our top group in the fall and we will prepare her to play both outside positions
3403845 kaitlynn is one of the most competitive players we have recruited in my time at nebraska
3403846 she not only loves to play volleyball but loves to win and that is evident when she steps on the court kaitlynn is a dynamic attacker who jumps out of the gym she is coming off shoulder surgery in the spring and we will take our time making sure she is completely healthy before she returns to action
3403847 to be a top 10 program you have to have that dominant right side attack
3403848 weve lived on that at nebraska and lindsey has the opportunity to be the next great right side player in this program she has the ability to be a consistent point scorer and also shut down opposing hitters with her blocking
3403849 sydney is not only a great player as she has shown in the usa program but she is someone people gravitate to and has a personality that fits in well with this team
3403850 she plays with a great passion and energy and will be a fan favorite and team leader in our program
3403851 brigette is an important recruit for us and will have a significant role as a true freshman
3403852 she comes from a volleyball background as her dad is one of the most successful coaches in the state and has an understanding of our program she gives us depth at the setter spot and we will train her to be ready to play for us this year

3403908 the family on holiday from cheshire had attempted to launch the inflatable into heavy seas against locals warnings but the dinghy kept flipping over and the launch was aborted
3403909 they soon got into difficulties when one of the light alloy paddles snapped battling against the swell
3403910 the father jumped into the sea to retrieve the paddle but the dinghy was rapidly swept away from him further out to sea

3404089 having all the facilities you need under one roof here is fantastic you have an indoor training facility and the quality and standard of the gym for strength and conditioning is fantastic
3404090 we just operate out of a rugby club we only have a playing pitch and a training pitch and our own gym it is not to the same standard as the fantastic new one here but improvements are under way

3404122 el objetivo principal es la simplificaci n de tr mites
3404123 es lo contrario porque justamente lo que no queremos es que la gente siga haciendo tr mites en varias ventanillas
3404124 la historia es que la anses asigna cuil y la afip cuit y la verdad es que en personas f sicas ambas bases deber an ser id nticas porque no hay motivos de que sean distintas

3404193 a new blog doesnt have to be ground breaking or political or showbiz to be influential sometimes the blogger behind it just needs to be a good person for he himself to become a positive influence to the bloggers he meets and the readers he writes for well fritz tentativa is certainly the nicest and friendliest new blogger ive ever had the pleasure of meeting so my last slot goes to him
3404194 this blog demonstrates how personal experiences can be relate able and interesting even to people who do not know the blogger this blog excels in turning seemingly insignificant events and thoughts into interesting thought provoking and entertaining reads
3404195 seriously why are people forgetting about him fritz is probably the break out star of 2007 after whipping up one of the best looking themes weve seen in a while but hes no longer using that now he has made his mark as someone who could act as an elder statesman a photography guru or the unfortunate victim to omaritaygate yes people you can vote for fritz

3404198 dickery flawlessly written posts total paparazziness despite his numerous attempts to become a
3404199 fritzified is always a fun read and is of course updated and maintained by the one and only fritz tentativa if you havent experienced his wit and photography skillz then youre in for a treat
3404200 fritz tentativa has a way with words and pictures with his biting wit and massive rockstar potential whatever that means he turns every blog post into something someone with a biting wit and a massive rockstar potential would write armed with his nokia n82 he snaps away turning each moment into a photo you wouldnt believe was taken with a camera phone i guess thats why hes a diva
3404201 ive decided to nominate fritzified com a wholesome combination of lifestyle food gadgetry even fashion but written from an intelligent point of view and not just flashy superficiality
3404202 how can you not enjoy the ramblings and the musings of fritz from discussing the fine things in life to social and philosophicals fritizified com is a virtual cornucopia of ideas time spent there is not boring

3404271 with a little dns spoofing i fed my own list into the iphone and effectively killed by name applications that attempt to use the gps it looks like thats all its set to do right now but i may just not have found the vaporize switch
3404272 either it is an anti malware solution and the iphone has a switch somewhere to vaporize any app or its not an anti malware solution and is really designed to kill applications that interfere with apples business model such as unsanctioned traffic navigation software
3404273 unless for some reason they decided to build two separate mechanisms into the iphone to do this of which the other one is invisible this one likely feeds a master kill switch perhaps there is a special setting in the configuration file which can vaporize the app all together

3404311 the unions are discussing with the employees they have said they will have an open mind on it
3404312 while the social networking trend first took off in north america it is beginning to reach a point of maturity in the region
3404313 however the phenomenon is still growing rapidly in other regions around the world especially as the established american brands turn their focus to developing markets
3404314 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3404315 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3404316 this guy in the movie is being chased by these guys and he breaks up with his girlfriend but after he comes close to getting killed
3404317 so he calls her up and says hey look youre the light of my life and were meant to be together and ive made a mistake
3404318 so then hes like talking to her and telling her this and she says lets get married
3404319 and hes like whoa uh well no and um thats such a mistake and tells the girl oh there are better things out there for you and you know im such a dumbass anyhow
3404320 i have been in this job for ten years now and i sense a mood for something to happen
3404321 if we had mentioned this three years ago i think the reaction would have been different
3404322 now everyone club chairmen managers players officials fans media are all saying we saw things last season that overstepped the mark
3404323 i do not want to take the passion out of the game but it would be nice to take some of the venom away
3404324 it is difficult to say that without making it appear that we are trying to sanitise everything that is not what we are saying at all
3404325 you have not lived until you have done something for someone who can never repay you
3404326 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon
3404327 a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging
3404328 the retail sale lease licensing or use of specified digital products transferred to or accessed by subscribers or consumers
3404329 sales of digital audio works music digital audiovisual works movies music videos tv shows and digital books
3404330 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3404331 golden state retailers would be at a competitive disadvantage to out of state companies
3404332 adopt a regulation subjecting digital property transfers to the sales and use tax law state and local revenues could increase by approximately 114 million annually
3404333 a series of related images which when shown in succession impart an impression of motion together with accompanying sounds if any
3404334 i suspect we will see the next 14 attempting to address it in the next legislative cycle
3404335 as these technologies meet there is this question of what is digital goods and what is software
3404336 to define where technology is today and how it should be taxed
3404337 provided that the non electronic version of that item was not exempt
3404338 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3404339 the sale of digital music delivered electronically to customers for download on their computers constitutes the sale of intangible property and is not subject to sales or use tax
3404340 we are not in a rush we need to make sure what we do benefits our customers
3404341 i value diversity and i value a different way of thinking
3404342 he will have to improve the quality of services we offer our customers and stay profitable
3404343 i feel pretty confident when i look at our order intake when i look at the pipeline when i look at our customers and when i look at what i can bring to them
3404344 i wouldve been hard pressed to come up with an example where electronic wedding invitations would be acceptable except when real life intervenes
3404345 in the past i never would have thought to use an electronic invitation because i dont know if it was as much of a formality as it was about brand awareness and being so protective over how the brand was portrayed
3404346 image was so important the paper stock the font we would have invitation designers and wed go through multiple edits
3404347 people always wanted to speak to the hostess when they made a reservation at a restaurant now they just use opentable
3404348 there was a whole segment of event types that people just did not want to use electronic invitations for
3404349 id like to believe that because of how we do things you also get the aesthetic aspect of it you dont have to sacrifice it
3404350 not having to use paper is huge when youre trying to be eco conscious
3404351 its better for the environment its cheaper if not free and youre collecting the majority of your rsvps in a place where theres no human error people either hit yes no or maybe and itll download into a list
3404352 there are always ways to do paper invitations in a cost effective way
3404353 you can get paper print them yourself hand write them
3404354 that point is actually quite well taken because it does create quite a lot of paper waste what might be interesting is to see if there are people or companies that come up with very low impact ways of generating invitations that are either easily recyclable or directly reusable
3404355 if you really know your guests and you really know its a preference for them i think thats great
3404356 at new york fashion week youve got 12 days of shows and events and its highly highly competitive
3404357 if you dont send out a paper invitation it doesnt work theres something about it landing on someones desk and having it be tactile
3404358 a large not quite a quarter yet but about 20 percent of our events are actually wedding related
3404359 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more

3404370 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3404371 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3404372 you cant account for everyones stupid actions but when things do happen if you respond to it and take the appropriate action thats reassuring
3404373 thats just its wrong its a place where families come to eat and them taking a bath in the sink thats just not work ethic
3404374 burger king corp was just notified of this incident and is cooperating fully with the health department we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident we have also taken appropriate corrective action on the employees that were involved in this video additionally the remaining staff at this restaurant is being retrained in health and sanitation procedures
3404375 thats just disgusting i wouldnt want to eat here after i heard something like that thats just not appropriate for employment
3404376 this kind of stunt really is a black eye for the restaurant itself
3404377 i distrust those people who know so well what god wants them to do because i notice it always coincides with their own desires
3404378 hedonism with rules isnt hedonism at all its the republican party
3404379 nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet

3404462 en los ltimos a os en la comunitat valenciana hemos pasado de 900 a 10 000 plazas de albergue hostales en una apuesta consorciada entre las administraciones y la sociedad civil para poder desarrollar el interior

3404478 adem s de ser una barbaridad supone un insulto para los municipios de interior que conocen perfectamente las pol ticas tur sticas del consell de camps

3404531 it is a lesson to us all that captains are not necessarily born they can be made
3404532 kevin pietersen might not be the best captain in the world in the next few months but he can learn to become a great captain just as michael vaughan did vaughan got better and better with each game
3404533 it always seemed vaughan and fletcher were still close and certainly closer than vaughan and moores that is understandable but now there is a chance for pietersen and moores to create a bond
3404534 one thing he pietersen will definitely bring is his absolute professionalism he pushes himself hard in all aspects of practice and preparation and if he can create that environment for the rest of the team then he should be successful

3404557 the overwhelming majority of republican senators have pledged to protect october 1 as american energy freedom day so we can reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower the cost of gas at the pump
3404558 many people arent aware that the bans on drilling must be renewed every year and all we have to do is allow these prohibitions to expire on october 1 in just 50 days americans will have the freedom to pursue their own energy resources here at home our letter is very straightforward we will actively oppose any effort to extend the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale

3404715 if you are an internet addict you are familiar with tux the linux penguin logo all over the internet linux fans are sounding off about how it and free software or freeware can save you money effort nerves data time and just perhaps your soul
3404716 their mission to replace microsoft windows and proprietary applications with the linux operating system and freeware their claims are dazzling linux fans begin with this claim that freeware costs nothing next that it is quicker more flexible more customizable and more resilient to crashes and headaches inherent to windows while less subject to attack identity theft adware spyware and malware and that new life can be wrung from old computers staggering under the burden that windows necessarily inflicts on them linux and freeware proponents also maintain that a free operating system and free software comes without the ethical and legal conundrums associated with microsofts business practices for example preventing computer manufacturers from installing competing operating systems and software on new computers providing os upgrades that alter and or nullify existing programs and failing to provide sufficient information to allow competing free software distributors to inter operate their wares with windows
3404717 a free lunch is always a problematic economic model and that is the case with freeware which is predicated on non secret programming intended to yield a cooperative non competitive development process open for all comers to build on what already exists with no secrets and little or no emphasis on personal profit or glory there is no need to reinvent the wheel for revisions and the end result is supposed to be cheaper and better software the reality is that much freeware is written by free agent developers who waive most of the intellectual property interests normally accorded them free software licenses like the general public license allows and encourages free use and distribution and programs are readily available on the internet to download at no charge
3404718 but freewares impact on the marketplace is stark the fact that anyone with programming skill is free to appropriate a work and give it away means freeware makers cannot expect to generate a profit from r amp d investments
3404719 so instead of coming from large reputable companies freeware comes from students underemployed programmers and fly by nighters from distant continents who ask for donations rather than payment who seem to have little idea of what american commercial users want and expect in a professional environment even the little bit of decent freeware is illogically crafted amateurish and unintuitive technical support is rare and even then second rate
3404720 students underemployed programmers and fly by nighters from distant continents
3404721 it is an operating system that ostensibly competes with microsoft windows and apple mac os for use on office and home computers the case for it is that an updated linux is available for almost everyone at no cost with a diy installation as substitute for the problematic proprietary alternatives that cost hundreds of dollars but the argument is bogus
3404722 in fact linux is not really cheaper for lawyers or anyone whose time is money whereas windows is typically bundled with the purchase of a new computer buying it that way really only adds about 75 under bulk licenses to computer makers and that is money that cant really be saved by avoiding windows because computers sold without any os or with linux as an alternative are hard to find and dont sell cheaper
3404723 so for those inclined to try linux for free the break even point is about 15 billable minutes far less time than is needed to actually install it assuming that you find a deal for a computer without a proprietary os
3404724 meanwhile a linux diy installation like a diy auto repair is extremely complex convoluted time consuming and often dicey
3404725 something a lawyer may not want to bet his or her practice on
3404726 as for linux trying to improve performance on old computers at no cost that is counterproductive for lawyers given the fact that a fully loaded and presumably much more powerful refurbished windows computers can be purchased for 219 00 almost making computers throw away items
3404727 but if one insists tune ups or re installations of windows may restore the desired level of functionality at minimal cost and yet provide more utility for middle aged computers that are not powerful enough for new versions of linux
3404728 in fact no linux distributions would install on any computers that were 6 years or older in my office linux required too much computing power
3404729 for those computers that were 3 5 years old linux required fooling with the bios settings and the partitions to the filing system jobs wished on no one
3404730 as for finding an older version of linux that is not as resource intensive finding a version right for an old computer is a complex task and if you find one the installation is more difficult because older distributions did not include friendly guis
3404731 but even the most powerful linux versions often do not live up to promises because they do not do everything that windows users take for granted for example hardware manufacturers do not uniformly provide linux drivers so some devices and peripherals simply wont work with linux forcing users to choose between their peripherals and linux after installation and there may be no way of knowing whether a given peripheral is supported except by trial and error
3404732 there may be no way of knowing whether a given peripheral is supported
3404733 instead of providing good and relatively easy to learn housekeeping tools for certain kinds of chores such as installing new programs or fonts tasks that even marginal employees can pick up readily linux insists that users do many of these jobs by returning to computing as it was in the 1970s using a black screen to type in one of thousands of specific commands with gibberish names and abbreviations to get programs to install or launch at least it is a step up from punch cards linux has an 800 page list of commands and command options that many of its fans choose to memorize as a predicate to controlling even the most of its basic computing functions such as launching programs ugh
3404734 another justification to use linux is that it does not need virus protection and it comes bundled with a variety of free applications whereas windows software costs 1 000 for tools like corell wordperfect office photoshop elements mcafee antivirus and acrobat professional this too is an overstatement virus protection is readily available at no charge to windows users e g avast and the linux productivity applications of interest to law firms are also free for windows users e g gimp photo manipulation real player audacity firefox and the open office business suite
3404735 freeware comes from students underemployed programmers and fly by nighters from distant continents who ask for donations rather than payment who seem to have little idea of what american commercial users want and expect in a professional environment even the little bit of decent freeware is illogically crafted amateurish and unintuitive technical support is rare and even then second rate
3404736 more importantly however the free applications touted by linux fans are uniformly poor and unacceptable for a law office open office does not have grammar check
3404737 freeware fans also rave that their product invites reverse engineering by individual users
3404738 the next most significant point made by linux and freeware community is that their software designs makes it less vulnerable to attacks and human errors it maintains that end users get more protection without resort to self defense mechanisms like antivirus software that requires additional computer memory and processing power and slows work and linux proponents claim that if there is any kind of problem or a viral threat or other os disaster there is an army of linux programmers standing by to remedy the situation but these claims do not reflect my experience i tried to install puppy linux without success and my e mails to the developers were ignored
3404739 although adt assured me that their system would protect me from intruders i tried to install a new toilet in the bathroom and none of their people would help me
3404740 ark linux developers could not explain why my computers wi fi card didnt work
3404741 the claims for linux quality ultimately border on the mythical granted linux may unlike windows crash only one program at a time without taking down the entire operating system but linux programs did not seem to crash any less than windows programs then again the web site to report linux bugs to its developer was overloaded and it crashed
3404742 and as far as freedom from attack the jury is still out as linux remains under the radar with only a small percentage of the computing community using it the best that can be said is that it provides security through obscurity because miscreants like hunters seek out mostly big game
3404743 but even that assessment is questionable since linux operating systems issue security patches on a daily basis just like windows
3404744 going beyond the poor quality of applications and the complexity of acquiring and installing linux
3404745 typical users will find plenty of other reasons to dislike linux the desktop environments the layer of housekeeping software between the operating system and the applications used are particularly unfriendly and much too convoluted to be successfully used by marginal staff this is partly due to open source developers dislike for all things microsoft in demonizing microsoft linux goes out of its way to avoid what windows does best e g implementing user friendly interfaces in file managers and other programs
3404746 for instance the linux file managers reveal a confounding multitude of panes filled with weird tiny and meaningless graphics and icons that fail to suggest where files are saved that makes locating files a treasure hunt which would not be all that horrible if the process did not involve chasing around your own tail when moving around a layout that is chaotic
3404747 it is a job even more complicated by the fact that routine files are placed in folders buried no less than eight layers down in the directory tree with a pathname like home arklinux hdc usr share my documents clientname clientproject documentname it is maddening
3404748 c documents and settings username my documents clientname clientproject documentname
3404749 to make linux hum its proponents have almost as a rite of passage memorized the 800 page list of computer commands to program discreet actions
3404750 they enjoy linux and its idiosyncrasies as a way to protest microsofts continued dominance in the software industry as computer geeks
3404751 if youre in it for the money keep your distance from linux and freeware

3404773 by using the blue book as my primary source i would go into local newspapers and just pick up the trails when i figured out what direction these ufos were flying i would go from the baltimore area and through maryland west virginia and ohio and i picked up the trail these ufos were flying that night
3404774 there were 10 actual crash landings that night in west virginia

3404818 the european commission is extremely concerned about the fighting and deplores the loss of lives and the human suffering it causes we call for an immediate end of hostilities thousands of civilians women and children are caught up in the fighting in and around south ossetia our fast track funding of 1 m is a very first contribution to meet their basic humanitarian needs further funds could be released as soon as the assessment of the needs will be finalized on the ground however emergency relief teams are only able to operate if all conflict parties respect international humanitarian law humanitarian access and safe passage for uprooted civilians and aid workers is crucial
3404819 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3404820 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3404821 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3404822 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3404823 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3404824 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3404825 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction

3404834 while we are confident scotlands economy is well placed to address the challenges presented by the current economic climate the scottish government will do all we can to support key industries like the energy sector which has the potential to make a significant contribution towards our goal of increased sustainable economic growth despite international challenges
3404835 the value of our oil is an all time high yet we have still to reap the full benefits of our natural resources
3404836 a scottish oil fund a concept supported by over 80 per cent of people in scotland can deliver direct and long term benefits
3404837 we are making great strides in becoming a world leader in renewable energy and have the potential to generate 10 times scotlands peak demand for electricity
3404838 in the last few weeks we have announced a new biomass plant at markinch an extension to crystal rig windfarm and the creation of europes largest windfarms in south lanarkshire an investment of around 800 million in wind and biomass
3404839 earlier this year we launched the largest ever single prize for marine renewable energy the 10 million saltire prize with the support of the national geographic society we will pursue the most innovative ideas to maximise scotlands full marine potential
3404840 these are just some of the achievements and developing opportunities for scotland
3404841 its a miracle that people would waste money on such matters
3404842 the scottish government is determined to help the fishing industry adapt to high fuel costs and although we cant control the price of fuel we will do what we can to help in other ways
3404843 the fishing industry has been particularly hard hit with the crippling increase in fuel prices fuel costs count for as much as half the earnings of boats and cannot be passed on
3404844 through the fuel task force we have worked closely with the industry to pull together the outline of a three year plan of action that will help the fishing industry in scotland adapt to cope with rising fuel costs
3404845 the scottish government has earmarked almost 29 million a combination of scottish and european funds to support this plan of action and deliver change across the fleet and the onshore sectors money will start to become accessible within the next few weeks
3404846 despite limited resources we are willing to do all we can to make these go as far as possible to help our fishermen and the industries and communities they support i am disappointed at the continuing lack of financial support from the uk government and will continue to press for this
3404847 we cannot alone address the wider economic impact of rising fuel prices that responsibility rests with ministers in london and we are continuing to press hard for action to restrain energy costs and reflate the economy but where we can we will act
3404848 the measures i have outlined today set out the steps which need to be taken over the next three years to ensure the fishing sector is economically and environmentally sustainable
3404849 i firmly believe that the scottish fishing industry has a vibrant future as a key part of our thriving coastal communities

3404881 with spending on external forensic services reaching 169 million a year the new framework offers many benefits to the police service and suppliers not only will it reduce turnaround times and provide greater efficiencies it will help stabilise the marketplace and allow for a more consistent quality of service to be delivered by suppliers this is the first project to be delivered under forensics21 and is the start of a larger programme of improvement in police science and technology
3404882 the national forensic framework will offer significant savings to the police service and is a good example of how working together with key suppliers can help drive efficiencies we are very pleased to be able to offer this framework to forces to secure improved forensic analysis services for the future

3404903 it is deeply concerning that we have found a child of this age with a weapon
3404904 the new deal will see the players well rewarded they will earn considerably more if they win
3404905 the initial concern was because there could be an implication that the players hadnt played to their best and that was insulting
3404906 both sides were robust but committed to sorting out a deal the discussions went to the wire but were delighted with the outcome
3404907 i have been in with the squad recently and there is a tremendous atmosphere in the camp everyone is delighted to put these issues to bed
3404908 its important these off the field matters were resolved ahead of the season
3404909 id like to thank the pra and the players for their input during some very constructive negotiations

3404911 we get people who have a map and a compass but dont know how to use them people with no lights and some with no maps at all
3404912 in the old days people only went on the mountains when they knew what they were doing but now people are going out there on a whim
3404913 they are underestimating the mountains they should not be getting lost a lot of these people are going up there and they havent got a clue
3404914 sometimes we will get five rescues a day because we are all volunteers it puts incredible strain on family friends and employers
3404915 there was a couple who phoned up to be rescued and asked how long it would take because they had a dinner party to get back for
3404916 i think were seeing more of what we call avoidable call outs in the lake district
3404917 if you havent walked mountains before it certainly shouldnt be the first thing you do
3404918 its very difficult really considering how often people talk about it being a spur of the moment idea it shouldnt be like that
3404919 you have got to do the basic training and get walking otherwise people can get into difficulty because theyve not prepared
3404920 you definitely need a compass and map and someone who knows what theyre doing
3404921 brian would be walking by and put his hands on my chest it happened quite a few times

3404962 the case for investment in regeneration assets is more compelling if residential property and development activity are included in fact the more exciting returns and possibly the more stable income streams have been enjoyed by those willing to diversify away from standard big box commercial standing property investments and towards residential small box neighbourhood commercial type properties and development activity
3404963 for the first time development returns have been analysed and show the potential outperformance of regeneration development returns the results should be of interest to both developers and investors alike importantly the investment returns also show that regeneration investors are well poised to benefit as the property market recovers over the medium term
3404964 in this difficult market it will pay to look carefully at property investment opportunities in regeneration areas the index clearly shows regeneration properties will eventually outperform when the cycle eventually moves upward the long term prognosis for regeneration property remains good

3405232 we decided to seek at the encouragement of dr curtis a second opinion
3405233 lindsay went to dr matthew hudder who is an expert on hcm at the harvard medical center after another series of tests dr hudder also concluded that lindsay was at a very high risk
3405234 out of the 400 plus physicals we conducted this year lindsay is one of the most fit and conditioned athletes that we have at usf
3405235 but she does have a family history of the thickened heart walls
3405236 lindsay will probably live a fine life with little to no complications
3405237 but she is at a high level of risk when she exerts herself
3405238 the university and its staff can be credited with saving lindsays life
3405239 they have stepped up their standards in looking for medical conditions with their athletes not all universities are doing ekgs on their student athletes we are at the cutting edge with that
3405240 you dont even try i am so proud of lindsay and the way she has handled herself in this tough situation she has demonstrated such courage and maturity she is a true inspiration to everyone around her she is a great player and an even better person
3405241 shes dedicated so much to our team having her on the field with us was such a great asset we want to be able to give her something by playing our season in honor of her

3405248 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi

3405257 hes getting really in good game shape he hasnt been shooting well but today he didnt concentrate on shooting he concentrated on rebounding and then the shots came we havent shot the ball well from the outside since weve been here but i believe we will to see carmelo come on like that its encouraging
3405258 i told coach before this tournament im going to try to get the record 16 rebounds in one of these games
3405259 i know i can score at any given time but ill leave the scoring up to kobe lebron and dwyane wade hes playing fantastic right now so if i can go out there and grab 16 rebounds thats a whole lot better for the team than scoring 20 25 points
3405260 the russians are looking for an excuse to kill georgians
3405261 generally when a country is being invaded you dont call on it to show restraint
3405262 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them
3405263 would kicking russia out of the g 8 have stopped this invasion
3405264 i dont see how those two are related that is the test of leadership are you proposing things that can advance american interests
3405265 to condemn russias aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization
3405266 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3405267 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3405268 im kind of leaning towards obama but hes a rookie you know and im kind of worried about that
3405269 hillary said shes the candidate for people who need a president
3405270 in other words people who dont need a president can afford to vote for obama because hes exciting represents change etc
3405271 the mother that had to cut back on groceries because of rising gas prices the guy i met who couldnt fill up his gas tank to go on a job search
3405272 obama could use a little more empathy and a little less lecture
3405273 im hoping obama would be a better steward of the economy but im undecided
3405274 i dont like mccain mccain is bush and weve already had this one you know what i mean
3405275 base are independent leaning voters concerned by overspending in washington
3405276 obama can battle mccain in appealing to those kind of voters very well
3405277 mccain hed be a good military leader but i dont know as far as running the economy
3405278 its hard to say at this point whod handle the economy better
3405279 we need change so whoevers going to make the biggest change

3405281 bonnet is often credited with the first use of evolution as a biological term osborn 1929 carneiro 1972 yet haller coined it in 1744 as a name for preformationism but the theory of evolution proposed by swammerdam and malpighi prevails almost everywhere sed evolutionem theoria fere ubique obtinet a szuammerdamio et malphighio proposita most of these men teach that there is in fact included in the egg a germ or perfect little human machine and not a few of them say that all human bodies were created fully formed and folded up in the ovary of eve and that these bodies are gradually distended by alimentary humor until they grow to the form and size of animals cole 1930 p 86 adelmann 1966 pp 893 894 haller had made a sound etymological decision for the latin evolutio denotes an unrolling of parts already existing in compact form as in a scroll or the fiddlehead of a fern bowler 1975
3405282 even the word evolution is of little use to us here because it has been given many different meanings bowler 1974 the latin evolutio means to unroll and implies no more than unpacking a structure already present in a more compact form the first biological use of the term evolution was to describe the growth of the embryo in the womb which many people today still imagine to be a kind of small scale model of the more general process of lifes development on earth many early embryologists however believed that the growth of the embryo was no more than the expansion of a preformed miniature of the complete organism already present in the fertilized ovum this would be a process of a character quite unlike the popular image of progressive evolution although it could quite aptly be described by the original latin meaning by 1800 this preformation theory had been discredited and the evolution of the embryo was thought to be a goal directed process by which a complex structure was built up out of unformed matter this comes closer to the modern idea of evolution but it is important to note that by using the growth of the embryo as a model one is given the impression that living structures ascend a fixed pattern of development toward a predetermined goal the earliest applications of the word evolution to the history of life on earth carry a similar implication because many nineteenth century naturalists thought that the embryo recapitulates the ascent of life toward the pinnacle of creation man
3405283 the progressionist implication was retained in a rather different form by the philosopher herbert spencer the person who did most to popularize the term evolution in its modern context spencer advocated a system of cosmic progress which included a theory of the inevitable evolution of life toward higher forms darwins theory came to be tagged evolution even though he seldom used the term himself and most people still imagine that evolution is an essentially progressive process both darwin and spencer made an important step beyond the embryological concept because they believed the process was open ended rather than directed toward a single goal such as man spencer still insisted that evolution involved a necessary advance toward higher levels of organization thus introducing a more sophisticated concept of progress but darwin was suspicious even of this because he felt that the concept of biological progress was very difficult to define the popular idea of evolution as progress is now seen to be inadequate on two counts it is ambiguous because we can define progress either as a movement toward a predetermined goal or in terms of ascending levels of general complexity it is also misleading because some interpretations of evolution involve only change without implying any form of progress
3405284 i shall trace how organic change came to be called evolution to begin with a paradox darwin lamarck and haeckel the greatest nineteenth century evolutionists of england france and germany respectively did not use the word evolution in the original editions of their great works darwin spoke of descent with modification lamarck of transformisme haeckel preferred transmutations theorie or descendenz theorie why did they not use evolution and how did their story of organic change acquire its present name darwin shunned evolution as a description of his theory for two reasons in his day first of all evolution already had a technical meaning in biology in fact it described a theory of embryology that could not be reconciled with darwins views of organic development in 1744 the german biologist albrecht von haller had coined the term evolution to describe the theory that embryos grew from preformed homunculi enclosed in the egg or sperm and that fantastic as it may seem today all future generations had been created in the ovaries of eve or testes of adam enclosed like russian dolls one within the next a homunculus in each of eves ova a tinier homunculus in each ovum of the homunculus and so on haller chose his term carefully for the latin evolvere means to unroll indeed the tiny homunculus unfolded from its originally cramped quarters and simply increased in size during its embryonic development
3405285 evolution as a description of darwins descent with modification was not borrowed from a previous technical meaning it was rather expropriated from the vernacular evolution in darwins day had become a common english word with a meaning quite different from hallers technical sense the
3405286 on the origin of species a facsimile of the first edition
3405287 it often happens that when a greek or latin word is given a new lease on life in one of the major modern languages and especially in english the original meaning of the word may be replaced by a rather different one this is particularly the case when a word which was a strongly transitive verb in the classical context is resuscitated as a generic noun in the modern diction the word evolution is a case in point the root of that all important modern noun is the latin verb evolvere whether used by historians like tacitus and livy or by poets like ovid and catullus or by philosophers like lucretius seneca and cicero the verb evolvere either meant to eject some thing with a rolling or coiling motion or to cause some thing to flow out or roll out from somewhere or to unwind some thing or to unwrap or uncover some thing in all these cases it was clearly assumed that the thing or the object of the action had already been there only one and uncertain case is found in classical latin literature for the noun form evolutio of the verb evolvere according to the testimony of the two volume oxford latin english dictionary
3405288 today more and more evolutionists are doing what darwin thought impossible they are studying the evolutionary process not through fossils but directly in real time in the wild evolution in the flesh evolution comes from the latin evolutio an unrolling unfolding opening biologists are observing year by year and sometimes even day by day or hour by hour details of lifes unrolling and opening right now taken together these new studies suggest that darwin did not know the strength of his own theory he vastly underestimated the power of natural selection its action is neither rare nor slow it leads to evolution daily and hourly all around us and we can watch

3405299 we heard from instructors that they dont have the technical expertise budget or time to create a professional looking online presence and so thats exactly what weve created for them
3405300 as a fitness professional i think this site is exactly what is needed to promote ourselves and our clubs without asking our members to join social networks that can be unsafe or inappropriate i think many of my students and staff will use this site to connect
3405301 we believe one reason for our impressive growth is that we have inspired our members to think beyond just fitness and wellness and more in terms of a personal and fun approach to their health something we like to call being healthalicious
3405302 beyou tv lets me try some workouts that i would be too shy to do in front of a class full of strangers i also travel a lot so accessing beyou tv from my hotel room is like taking all of my favorite instructors on the road with me my beyou tv membership is my fulfillment of a no more excuses promise i made with myself
3405303 beyou tv is for anyone who wants more than a good workout on the for anyone looking to improve their overall health and well being
3405304 since launch weve added hundreds videos from some of the best instructors and teachers in the areas of physical fitness personal growth and spiritual growth and now were connecting our members with local resources to extend their fitness program
3405305 textaloud quickly became a very important part of my learning process
3405306 then when reading text on a web page or in an e mail whenever i needed to check on how to pronounce the words i simply played them with textaloud
3405307 i could do this easily from within outlook firefox and internet explorer using the textaloud toolbars or from other applications using the clipboard monitoring feature
3405308 i installed an electronic dictionary which meant i was able to select an unknown word or phrase for a translation if needed
3405309 but the end result is that textaloud now speaks an english word to me using an english voice then repeats the word twice in german using the klaus german voice this process allows me enough time to repeat the word out loud and then finishes by repeating a phrase also incorporating the target word
3405310 textaloud is great for learning the proper pronunciations of foreign words no matter what the language
3405311 in addition since textaloud works with all standard text files all of the steps needed to create word repetitions and other exercises can be automated
3405312 these are invaluable for quickly and efficiently creating a custom language lesson
3405313 i love the fact that textaloud dutifully creates audio files for all my german language words and phrases which i can then sync with itunes into my treo and use whenever i have the time and inclination and wherever i go
3405314 ive also created audio books in english for long car trips with the family
3405315 the beauty of textaloud is that it is easy to use for the beginner and powerful for the advanced user
3405316 it has simplified every step of my language learning life i am no longer tied to the computer nor do i need to sit down with a book i can learn on a walk on a bus plane train anywhere
3405317 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3405318 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3405319 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3405320 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3405321 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3405322 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3405323 letter to a new president commonsense lessons for our next leader
3405324 son of privilege and dynasty who had defined himself as the president of only that fraction of the country which shared his world view
3405325 sen byrd doesnt believe sen mccain is going to be the next president
3405326 but if sen mccain is interested in receiving a copy of the book wed be happy to get him a copy
3405327 a big lie is still a lie tell the truth
3405328 let the press do its job even when that might sting
3405329 i would submit that a president who is unable to learn from his or her own mistakes and then to articulate for a curious public what he or she has learned is not prepared for that office
3405330 banished himself to the ignominious position of worst united states president ever
3405331 built much of its program around a basic commitment to lying

3405334 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
3405335 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
3405336 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
3405337 for so many of my supporters just like so many of baracks supporters this was a first time investment of heart and soul and money and effort and sleepless nights and miles of travel
3405338 its not a great relationship and its probably not going to become one
3405339 delegates can decide to do this on their own they dont need permission
3405340 we really need to focus at the convention on unifying the party behind senator obama
3405341 its personal with him in terms of his own legacy
3405342 and the race stuff really left a bad taste in his mouth
3405343 i am not a racist i never made a racist comment
3405344 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
3405345 you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office
3405346 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president i think we have two choices i think he should win and i think he will win
3405347 upon reflection leon dorsey is probably no 1 as the meanest criminal i prosecuted
3405348 like all blacks dorsey had every right to rob from whites and pillage white owned companies
3405349 let us not lay our hands upon the devil though yet let gods spiritual terrorism attack and consume them
3405350 dorsey is a hero and a legend i traveled from savannah to be here for this event and to lend the support of our brothers and sisters to the condemnation of texas whites

3405357 the frequency of these images and references dont make any sense unless youre trying to send the message that obama could be the antichrist
3405358 if they wanted to be funny if they really wanted to play up the idea that obama thinks hes the second coming there were better ways to do it
3405359 why use these awkward lines like and the world will receive his blessings
3405360 obama is correct in saying that the world is ready for someone like him a messiah like figure charismatic and glib the bible calls that leader the antichrist and it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance

3405393 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
3405394 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot

3405428 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3405429 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3405430 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3405431 fao greatly appreciates nigerias swift reporting and sharing of the relevant information about this new virus strain

3405451 when the presumptive nominee looked at the democrat field he realized that he was the only one other than hillary clinton who had acting president experience
3405452 he looks presidential and hes the only one whose loyalty to obama has been proven
3405453 obama has the right to choose whomever he wants selecting sen obama as his running mate would send a clear signal that hes not only the most qualified democrat to be president but hes also the only democrat worthy to succeed him

3405459 i am nervous going into the water again because i almost did drown once
3405460 i was out in the water and then the wave came but we learned in school to swim the other way when you get caught
3405461 there is a cultural issue that is translating into a drowning epidemic
3405462 now two to three generations of nonswimmers have an endemic fear of the water
3405463 many of these folks who are coming into the country today are from countries where traditionally they dont swim
3405464 the make a splash program becomes a conduit for our kids to become confident swimmers
3405465 the time to teach swimming is when a child is 7 8 9 10 years old instead of waiting
3405466 coming to the open ocean is a whole different thing than swimming in the pool
3405467 because underneath theres riptides and its dangerous if you dont know what you are doing
3405468 you cant say to a child you dont know how to swim so when you go to the beach dont go in the water
3405469 learning how to swim should be as automatic as teaching your child to walk or not to talk to strangers

3405482 i was certainly encouraged to hear the speaker last night suggest a willingness to allow the house to have an up or down vote on the merits of unlocking the potential of americas abundant energy resources but the proof will be in the proverbial pudding
3405483 house republicans have already made our position clear a position that includes remaining on the floor of the u s house to demand a genuine debate and straightforward vote on the most important issue facing americans today despite what we heard last night the speakers position is far from clear but she could clear that up by bringing the house back into session and working with republicans to pass a serious energy plan to bring down prices at the pump

3405500 an excellent primer for developing and implementing an antifraud program as part of a sox 404 fraud prevention and detection process a clear and concise history of fraud and the methods needed to deter it now and for the future it is like having a professor on call and in your office when you need one well written with easy to understand definitions and examples this is a must read for anyone who is putting a financial investigation unit in place
3405501 the book is an excellent anti fraud resource for those professionals charged with the responsibility of detecting investigating and preventing fraud i also highly recommend it to educators as a prospective textbook for a semester long course in macro fraud examination
3405502 this book better than any other in print hits the subject areas i cover in my fraud examination and forensic accounting class the authors have done a great job of presenting complicated terms and techniques in a manner for students to understand i particularly like the presentation of a frauds endgame namely the court case that recovers assets and puts these creeps in jail

3405504 one of the challenges of the week for chicago is finding a way to control the news cycle without the candidate
3405505 the record shows obama to be a fairly doctrinaire liberal democrat
3405506 sen barack obama d ill was the most liberal senator in 2007 according to national journals 27th annual vote ratings
3405507 the insurgent presidential candidate shifted further to the left last year in the run up to the primaries after ranking as the 16th and 10th most liberal during his first two years in the senate
3405508 on the difficult compromises that required the political courage to challenge ones own political constituency obama flinched the gang of 14 compromise on judicial appointments the immigration compromise to which obama tried to append union backed killer amendments and just last month the compromise on warrantless eavesdropping that garnered 68 votes in the senate but not obamas

3405511 el fen meno nace precisamente para dar satisfacci n a las mujeres que pasados los 45 a os de edad empiezan a tener la sensaci n de que han dado mucho a los dem s y tienen ganas de disfrutar ellas mismas

3405513 hay actitudes sociales a la hora de viajar que nos hace muy distintas a los hombres
3405514 hay unos puntos en com n de gustos y empat as que nos hacen sentirnos m s c modas viajando en un grupo de mujeres que en uno mixto
3405515 el hombre espa ol no est preparado una minor a s pero en general no
3405516 el drama de los malos tratos ocurre porque hay hombres que no encajan los cambios en el rol femenino en la sociedad espa ola hay a n una dosis importante de machismo que va cambiando pero a n queda
3405517 habr a tambi n que preguntarse si las mujeres espa olas est n preparadas para ello
3405518 las m s j venes s pero las de m s de 35 a os pueden sentirse culpables y lo importante es hacerlo bien sin complejos
3405519 cuando en una relaci n los esfuerzos de una mujer por abordar los problemas de sta encuentran por nica respuesta descalificaciones humillaciones burlas o incluso intimidaciones amenazas restricciones a la libertad de movimiento y eventualmente empujones golpes y otras acciones de fuerza se trata de una relaci n violenta ahora situ ndonos en relaciones tortuosas complicadas pero no violentas es importante tener presente que una pareja siempre se hace de a dos nunca son ella o l los nicos responsables como tampoco v ctimas pasivas de lo que sucede
3405520 fundamentalmente la insatisfacci n sostenida en la relaci n son bastante distintos los factores que producen bienestar en una relaci n de pareja y as tambi n es diferente para las personas lo que le produce malestar no existe la relaci n ideal buena para todas y todos aunque a veces tendemos a creerlo as las relaciones de pareja habitualmente incluyen mucho conflicto que se va resolviendo o manejando en el curso de toda la relaci n pero paralelamente hay experiencias de bienestar disfrute y desarrollo con el otro cuando deja de haber estos espacios y experiencias tambi n es indicador de una relaci n que no anda bien
3405521 no se culpen no se sientan v ctimas dense un espacio a s mismas para reconocer su valor y explorar sus experiencias hay mucho que aprender y disfrutar en otras relaciones adem s de la relaci n de pareja ya que una buena relaci n de pareja nunca depende s lo de ellas

3405534 everyone jumped up and jolted out we went flying down the stairs to see this thing just staring at it
3405535 i want to know exactly what it is and what its doing around here and i want it stopped
3405536 i saw it over a pond on a nearby farm high enough to just clear the trees traveling south

3405540 at one point all the lights went green then red then they went back to a pattern of green and red and white i felt like it was letting us know it knew we were watching it that was scary it went on for about 10 minutes
3405541 it was a group of light planes they fly in formation the undersides and under the wings are painted black so they cant be seen from the ground the planes are rigged with bright lights that they can turn from one color to another its the lights that give the shape to the ufo
3405542 the trooper spoke to a couple of the pilots and theyre getting a big kick out of it theres no violation of the law here

3405553 hopefully youre so satisfied from the cookies that youre not going to want to go and eat anything else until your sensible dinner
3405554 if you ate a few chips ahoy or a few mrs fields and you didnt go overboard and then you ate a reasonable dinner and kept your calories under control technically its very similar to the cookie diets
3405555 however the cookie diets are either fortified with a little bit of fiber or protein or some vitamins and minerals to keep you full and add a little extra nutrition
3405556 better to eat real food much better to eat real food

3405746 se chiron stata acquistata da novartis perch eravamo tra i migliori nel settore non dimentichiamoci per che le multinazionali investono finch rimaniamo competitivi altrimenti non hanno problemi ad andarsene io credo che sia la bravura delle persone a fare la differenza per questo necessario non solo portare in provincia di siena i migliori ricercatori del mondo ma una volta qui garantire loro anche le migliori condizioni e opportunit di operare
3405747 fare buona ricerca ha sottolineato rappuoli per un territorio vuol dire anche posti di lavoro in pi in provincia di siena abbiamo avuto un vantaggio importante grazie al sostegno delle fondazioni e delle istituzioni se non avessimo avuto un territorio che ha lavorato compatto oggi non avremo questi risultati
3405748 ma se gli investimenti ci sono ha chiuso rappuoli sulla produzione il discorso diverso siamo competitivi nel know how nella logistica e nel governo del territorio ma non sul costo del lavoro e sulla detassazione dellinvestimento in ricerca
3405749 e difficile affrontare largomento del biomedicale ha detto rossi senza parlare della necessit di politiche nazionali litalia considerata il quinto mercato per lindustria farmaceutica nel mondo e il terzo in europa ma lindustria privata del farmaco da noi investe ancora troppo poco noi sprechiamo fondi sopravvalutando ancora i farmaci de brevettati mentre quelle risorse potrebbero andare in ricerca
3405750 stiamo facendo ha continuato rossi ricerche per capire quanti brevetti si rilasciano in toscana questo un punto nodale perch negli altri paesi chi investe risorse in ricerca vuole anche avere il riscontro dei risultati
3405751 ma questo ha chiuso lassessore regionale alla sanit un settore che tutti gli analisti indicano come il comparto del futuro la provincia di siena ha una lunga tradizione nel biomedicale ma dobbiamo fare il salto scommetterci di pi e se al momento non sono attuabili politiche sul carico fiscale della ricerca rossi indica almeno tre ricette politiche di supporto alla ricerca infrastrutture nel campo biomedicale di grande attrattiva e un canale di bandi di ricerca come avviene in america
3405752 la toscana ha chiosato enrico rossi una piccola regione che se vuole essere viva a livello europeo e presente a livello mondiale deve muoversi come ununica realt
3405753 la costituzione di tls ha detto ceccherini ha portato allo stesso tavolo la regione e le cinque universit toscane dando il segnale che il perimetro della provincia di siena non sarebbe stato sufficiente per la fondazione con tls abbiamo lanciato il tema del superamento della dimensione locale
3405754 abbiamo scelto ha detto ceccherini di concentrarci sul rapporto tra ricerca e impresa per mantenere gli investimenti sul territorio rafforzare il rapporto tra istituzioni e aziende gi esistenti e creare condizioni per attrarne di nuove da questo dibattito sono nate siena biotech e la fondazione toscana life sciences
3405755 io credo che la toscana ha chiuso ceccherini nel 2015 dovrebbe andare allexpo con il biomedicale un settore in cui oggi la provincia di siena si gioca i maggiori rischi ma anche le pi grandi opportunit
3405756 il rapporto tra universit imprese e fondazioni nel campo della ricerca esiste ha detto silvano focardi rettore delluniversit degli studi di siena inserendosi nel dibattito ed un legame forte forse direi che poco conosciuto siena ha una lunga tradizione nella ricerca biotecnologica collegata con le imprese del territorio forse anche per questo che qui stata pi facile unevoluzione del sistema rimane il fatto che c bisogno di maggiore integrazione perch su molti filoni si continua a muoversi in maniera indipendente un dato interessante su come opera luniversit di siena dato dai servizi offerti dal liaison office ad imprese istituzioni e studenti con rapporti diretti con tls e una quantit di spin off notevole
3405757 alla necessit di portare i migliori nella nostra provincia aggiungo anche lopportunit di formarli nella nostra universit e soprattutto di farli star bene qui la citt deve essere attrezzata al meglio per far studiare e vivere una piccola comunit della ricerca internazionale
3405758 per essere competitivi ha aggiunto starnini dobbiamo iniziare ad usare meglio anche i fondi della ricerca diventare pi selettivi e rigorosi indirizzare lintero processo verso il risultato il prodotto deccellenza
3405759 in questa provincia abbiamo tante potenzialit che possono essere messe a frutto ma su alcune cose dobbiamo anche essere pronti a fare dei cambiamenti e certo un maggior rigore nellerogazione dei fondi dati in ricerca deve essere uno di questi

3405795 we went out there and competed with our hearts i think that made the difference i this this team has the biggest heart here maybe not the most talent but we did our jobs we stayed fired up and we fed off each other the whole time

3405813 while the media hounded wright for his anti american rants and while presidential hopeful sen barack hussein obama divorced him as his personal pastor obamas head will be crowned by leah daughtry who ardently believes in the same marxist black liberation theology preached by wright
3405814 we are thrilled to have leah daughtry leading our 2008 democratic convention team
3405815 i am honored to be a part of this exciting endeavor
3405816 like wright daughtry is in your face about her activism

3405822 god allows us to choose in the biggest matter whether to accept him in our lives how then can we take away choice on other profound issues
3405823 at the basis of black liberation theology is the understanding that god has a special place in his heart for those at the bottom of the ladder
3405824 instead of doing this in an ad hoc nature were building a force that understands civil affairs and understands effects based operations
3405825 so they know enough about those areas to be able to go out and do a good assessment
3405826 we have another team that just departed to go to the combined joint task force horn of africa
3405827 theyre going over there to do a 45 day pre deployment site survey in preparation for a commitment where well send two teams in december for a six month deployment

3405840 some people dont want to do a list because they dont want to make a menu
3405841 the time you take to plan your meals before heading to the store will pay for itself in results at the end of the week first make a list of healthy meals that fit your diet and are highly appealing
3405842 the participants who did the online ordering said it helped them stop impulse purchases and make healthier choices
3405843 you actually order less because you go look in the cupboard and make sure you dont have three boxes of rice already

3405857 hexamoll dinch is by far the best researched plasticizer on the market the eco efficiency analysis shows that the product has the lowest environmental impact throughout its life cycle so we are helping our customers to achieve sustainable development
3405858 now the project has progressed to the back seal on form fill seal lines this is mainly being applied to fresh produce although united biscuits has been looking at it for baked goods for instance theres still work to do on line speeds but factory trials are under way now and by the second quarter of 2008 there should be a system to create a fully hermetic bag
3405859 once there is real potential for a cost effective all round hermetic seal then it becomes more worthwhile for food companies to invest in improved materials and other shelf life enhancing technologies such as modified atmosphere packaging map
3405860 theres potential to extend shelf life by up to three days
3405861 we want to do consumer research logging food waste because we all assume that three extra days of shelf life will actually reduce wastage
3405862 we claim to have the most permeable film in the marketplace today combined with a membrane that manages the gas exchange and an active agent that inhibits the growth of microbes
3405863 in our case the cellulose has relatively good gas barrier characteristics but a poor moisture barrier with unprepared fruit and vegetables packaging that allows moisture to pass through is an advantage there are definite indications of improved shelf life although we have nothing quantified yet
3405864 this is a laminate of natureflex on the outside acting as a bio pp or transparent print web moisture and gas barrier and mater bi on the inside offering high heat seal strength and high tear resistance much like a bio pe
3405865 brands sometimes find they need less moisture barrier than they might have assumed was the case
3405866 higher and higher levels of barrier are not always going to be required going for gas and moisture permeability can be the right route to take in some cases
3405867 with many foods the biggest problem influencing shelf life is the oxidation or degradation of fats and oils
3405868 the shelf life for conventionally packaged soft cookies is typically a week to 10 days we have an application in organic cookies where that has risen to four months
3405869 i suspect someone will manage it either late in 2008 or early in 2009

3405886 corn based isosorbide can replace bisphenol a in baby bottles infant toys and other products used by children exposure to bisphenol a has been linked to health problems and we feel confident that this is a safe alternative
3405887 we are providing a renewable material for the polymer industry to benefit the environment and reduce us consumption of expensive imported petroleum
3405888 i am happy to see this important project move forward
3405889 today petroleum products are used extensively to manufacture plastics but this research has opened the way for us to substitute corn derived isosorbide for the petroleum based feedstock thus creating many potential opportunities as we move forward
3405890 we can envision ways that might work and we look forward to discussing how to tailor the icpb njit isosorbide program to meet the needs of potential partners
3405891 i am delighted that peoples park will benefit from the combined power of safer communities

3405894 to secure a third week of action is a tremendous credit to the safer communities team
3405895 this third event will put the spotlight on an area that doesnt get the attention it deserves add to your site
3405896 all i know is that we wanted to try one field using the organic treatment product
3405897 that particular product we felt was not effective and decided to stop using it
3405898 i think that the school district generally had an unrealistic view of the treatment
3405899 within the first application of any lawn it needs to be watered and i dont think they did that
3405900 im not going to dispute potters comments on watering the field
3405901 if i were him i would protect my product by making that claim i cant prove or disprove the claim on watering and not watering and neither can he
3405902 if you cut the grass too short the roots arent down as deep and therefore you get dirt spots
3405903 hes not trying to kill weeds hes trying to nourish the root systems weeds are always going to be a problem
3405904 compared to the rest of the campus its definitely better
3405905 the question you want to ask yourself is what are they doing for that amount of money
3405906 we did get the okay from the school board to spot treat areas using a chemical treatment in order to get ready for the school year
3405907 but we really want to stay with the policy of only using organic treatments
3405908 if you dont know how to quickly do things like find out where gamers are going for anime where teens hang out how to track down players interested in first person shooters or those who want a shopping game your cost of acquisition could be prohibitively high
3405909 at outspark weve maximized our marketing dollars to target relevant areas via various channels and community driven approaches in so doing achieving one of the lowest user acquisition costs in the industry
3405910 were flexible enough to reach the most valuable groups of users due to geographic or other demographic targeting without incurring significant additional marketing costs
3405911 this comes from a team with a great deal of both internet portal marketing experience and game publishing experience thats constantly fine tuned based on performance otherwise copious marketing dollars would have been wasted as many international publishers have found
3405912 while its easy to layout what publishers may be missing there are no blueprints for what makes one game succeed and another one fail
3405913 a lot of the reasons for success fall on the habits of the audience and with market size growing its more important than ever to find quality and relevant titles to bring to them
3405914 we are always on the lookout for new ways to introduce the growing number of casual and female gamers to different gaming genres and systems that they might have otherwise passed by
3405915 the release of madden nfl 09 all play for the nintendo wii provides an ideal opportunity for gamestop to offer the increasing number of female gamers with a site of their own it also gives women the opportunity to make madden nfl 09 an exciting and engaging new alternative to the typical girls night out by providing the necessary tools to get in the game

3405929 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3405930 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3405931 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment

3405955 given the characteristics of russian diplomacy which have been not only competitive but sometimes gripping people by the throat they are likely to feel irritated that someone else is in the field
3405956 the united states does not have a clear consistent strategy to promote our long term security interests or our near term energy and economic interests the russians do
3405957 now we start the process of implementing that plan and i hope that were able to commence next week
3405958 we want to create an honest discussion with everyone in the room
3405959 it is important of both what the americans and the iraqis think understanding exactly what it is that the local ips and the patrol ips say is their mission
3405960 the iraqi army will eventually go back to doing army stuff and the iraqi national police will go back to defending the borders
3405961 the ips will be there to defend baghdad and do all the basic police work

3405965 we brought in a variety of subject matter experts from iraq and around the armed services to speak about topics such as contracting functional topics staff topics like information operations intelligence logistics
3405966 im also very happy and pleased to announce that we have a variety of u s interagency partners here with us during the last three weeks representatives from the state department from the fbi from the u s agency for international development and a variety of other partners to include the u s embassy in iraq
3405967 our particular focus for this exercise is really to gain that initial understanding and build expertise in the ongoing activities and the expected activities that the u s forces are participating in
3405968 these include securing the iraqi population assisting the iraqi security forces and building their capacity and really setting the space and headroom for interagency and nongovernmental organizations and private sector support to the iraqi people
3405969 one year ago when we learned about a discrepancy with one of the guards
3405970 one security guards license was found to be altered during a follow up of the discovery it was determined that the security officer had not reported arrests as required by the lgs security plan
3405971 the company has a program where they screen employees and potential employees for criminal backgrounds and the employees are told when they get arrested they must self report failure to do so is grounds for discipline or dismissal
3405972 may have had an impact on his trustworthiness or reliability thereby causing lgs to be in violation of its security plan
3405973 the security officer admitted that he did not report the arrests for fear that he would lose his job the nrc determined that the officer was familiar with the requirements for working in a nuclear power plant and he had signed and dated forms indicating that he had not been arrested even though he was aware of the prior offenses and that such information was required to be reported

3406029 the most compelling evidence of all for the effectiveness of safe sex is the simple fact that when safe sex was taken on by men who have sex with men msm the escalation in infection rates was pegged back
3406030 this made it immediately clear that the risk of hiv infection was not associated with male to male sex per se rather it was associated with unsafe male to male sex
3406031 many of the samples in studies cited by the red cross are very small recruited from men at high risk and explicitly exclude men who practise safe sex in monogamous relationships they are not representative of all men who have sex with men
3406032 in those whose behaviour is exclusively heterosexual safe sex practices are less common if there was an outbreak of hiv amongst heterosexuals in australia it would clearly spread more rapidly than it would in the gay community
3406033 there is no evidence anywhere that people become gay by choice
3406034 the deferral of men who have sex with men is based on who they are rather than what they have recently done and can be likened to deferral on the grounds of being jewish or indigenous

3406063 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3406064 treatment resistant depression is a common problem where a relative minority of patients are completely well on their first regimen several studies have shown that incomplete recovery from depression leads to increased risk of relapse and poorer outcomes
3406065 aggressive treatment of refractory depression is a priority for our field but the options for treating patients are still poorly defined because depression is so common research and education regarding difficult to treat depression should be one of our highest priorities
3406066 the collaboration between dbsa and these prestigious organizations will ensure that providers receive education that will enhance their overall approach and communication with those living with trd

3406093 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations

3406442 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3406443 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3406444 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3406445 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3406446 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make demands on whether he is the appropriate person
3406447 the escalation on the part of the russia was disproportionate to their stated intentions
3406448 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises

3406451 catholics united welcomes the democratic partys new platform language as the seed of a practical and effective plan to significantly reduce abortions in the united states although we understand that catholic teaching does not support all the provisions contained in the partys abortion platform we believe faithful catholics will appreciate this development as a positive step toward abortion policy americans of diverse ideological and religious backgrounds can unite behind
3406452 for far too long extremists on both sides of the political spectrum have used the abortion issue to divide voters often at the expense of other pressing concerns by focusing on the root causes of abortion economic inequality lack of education and health care and other threats to the integrity of the american family the leaders of the democratic party are signaling a willingness to bring americans together in support of common ground solutions we hope and pray party leaders will pursue these abortion reduction policies with vigor both in the run up to and after the november elections as catholics we will continue to stand up for the sanctity of human life and encourage elected officials from both parties to do all they can to end abortion torture poverty war and other grave threats to the dignity of the human person

3406459 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3406460 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3406461 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3406462 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3406463 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3406464 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3406465 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3406466 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3406467 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3406468 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3406469 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3406470 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3406471 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

3406477 honor killings are specific to muslim religion and culture and must be addressed as such if ever honest debate about the matter is to ensue
3406478 georgia muslim charged with murder in honor killing of daughter
3406479 honor killings are not a south asian problem theyre an islamic problem
3406480 while they occur widely across most middle eastern and south asian cultures there have also been recorded honor crimes in the former soviet union and in africa
3406481 the quran never mentions the practice and it is inconsistent with issues of justice due process and personal accountability that are mentioned in the quran
3406482 dear mr martin islam has nothing to do with honor killings so your questions do not pertain to the faith you must seek your answers from sociologists that deal with such topics not the faith it is forbidden to kill any innocent person in islam period
3406483 but the truth is western culture offers the greatest boon to womens rights and must therefore be vigorously defended even if that means stepping into the realm of the politically incorrect
3406484 dangerous in terms of creating negative stereotypes which is an evil in itself but also decreases integration and concretizes negative attitudes within and without minority communities increasing the risk of honor crime amongst men who associate human rights with westerniszation
3406485 honor killing is a practice that one would find in patriarchal male dominated cultures that believe that the familys honor is represented by its women

3406488 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3406489 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3406490 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3406491 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3406492 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3406493 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3406494 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3406495 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3406496 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3406497 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3406498 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3406499 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3406500 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3406501 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states

3406508 republican presidential contender john mccain told the crowd that if the choice is between 200 000 cheering germans in berlin or the sound of american made hogs ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day

3406533 from 2002 through 2007 the federal government operated what it called a compassion capital fund that was designed to help faith based and community organizations expand their capacity during the life of the program congress funded it to the tune of 289 million
3406534 i will ask our new governor to follow the lead of a number of other governors and designate a person in his office to provide this assistance to faith based and community organizations if the governor doesnt think it is appropriate i will assign one of the few staff people dedicated to the lieutenant governor to fill this role
3406535 one way or another we will make sure that faith based organizations have the help they need
3406536 we in delaware need to be positioned to take advantage of a renewed federal focus on faith based initiatives
3406537 and those organizations in turn will work with us to help us with the whole range of issues facing kids in delaware safe educational after school activities and mentoring counseling and assistance to families in distress the whole range of issues that are so critical to the welfare of kids in our state together we will make this state one where every child can go as far as his talent and determination will take him

3406539 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3406540 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3406541 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3406542 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3406543 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3406546 in the medical world today the discovery of such a specific causal link in any disease is often the genesis of a new understanding regarding its pathology which can then lead to new theories about diagnosing it more quickly and treating it more effectively
3406547 i believe this discovery will make an important contribution since it identifies an identical and virulent clone of borrelia in both europe and north america
3406548 this may explain the recent spread of lyme disease in north america
3406549 the early symptoms of lyme disease are so similar to the flu chronic fatigue syndrome and a host of other common maladies that it is often incumbent upon the patient to insist upon a series of complicated assays in order to rule out the likelihood of lyme
3406550 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3406551 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3406552 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3406553 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3406554 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3406555 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3406556 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3406557 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3406558 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3406559 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3406560 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3406561 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3406562 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3406563 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3406564 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3406565 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3406566 this company does not look at people with disabilities in terms of quotas or statistics they consider people with disabilities an asset
3406567 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3406568 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3406569 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3406570 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3406571 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3406572 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3406573 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3406574 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3406575 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3406576 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3406577 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3406578 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3406579 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3406580 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3406581 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3406582 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3406583 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3406584 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3406585 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3406586 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3406587 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3406588 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3406589 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things

3406596 thinking where muhammad came from i think it is almost impossible that he could have known about things like the common origin of the universe because scientists have only found out within the last few years with very complicated and advanced technological methods that this is the case
3406597 somebody who did not know something about nuclear physics fourteen hundred years ago could not i think be in a position to find out from his own mind for instance that the earth and the heavens had the same origin

3406607 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3406608 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3406609 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3406610 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3406611 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers

3406617 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3406618 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3406619 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3406620 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3406621 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3406622 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3406623 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3406624 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3406625 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3406626 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3406627 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3406628 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing

3406635 all these years we kept mum as it is a sensitive issue related to the sentiments of the people but it is affecting our revenues all the dharmic institutes in huda and vuda regions pay tax even the state government has asked the ttd to pay it when the latter approached for an exemption

3406641 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3406642 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3406643 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3406644 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3406645 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3406646 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3406647 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3406648 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3406649 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3406650 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3406651 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3406652 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3406653 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3406654 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3406655 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3406656 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3406657 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3406658 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3406659 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3406660 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3406661 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3406662 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3406663 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3406664 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3406665 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3406666 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3406667 internally we recognised that our discerning customers both individuals as well as commercial establishments would appreciate a music system that would offer the same exceptional sound quality as the model d music system but that would be ideal for more intimate compact listening spaces
3406668 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3406669 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3406670 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3406671 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3406672 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3406673 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3406674 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3406675 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3406676 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3406677 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3406678 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3406679 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3406680 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3406681 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3406682 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3406683 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3406684 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3406685 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3406686 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3406687 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3406688 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3406689 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3406690 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3406691 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3406692 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3406693 just so you all know we did set a record
3406694 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3406695 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3406696 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3406697 re center ing american foreign policy by responsibly redeploying our combat forces from iraq and refocusing them on urgent missions
3406698 giv ing our military a new mission ending this war and giving iraq back to its people
3406699 remov ing our combat brigades at the pace of one to two per month and expect ing to complete redeployment within 16 months
3406700 keep ing a residual force in iraq to perform specific missions targeting terrorists protecting our embassy and civil personnel and advising and supporting iraqs security forces provided the iraqis make political progress
3406701 mak ing clear that we seek no permanent bases in iraq
3406702 spammers are going back to straightforward spam not image spam or attachments
3406703 the cyber criminals seem to have more success with social engineering and blended attacks
3406704 the threats challenging us today are becoming a blended variety that challenge both email and web security
3406705 without integrated and correlated protection between the two the ability to stay ahead of these threats will become increasingly difficult
3406706 isto para os loucos os desajustados os rebeldes os criadores de caso os pinos redondos nos buracos quadrados aqueles que v em as coisas de forma diferente eles n o curtem regras e n o respeitam o status quo voc pode cit los discordar deles glorific los ou caluni los mas a nica coisa que voc n o pode fazer ignor los porque eles mudam as coisas empurram a ra a humana para a frente e enquanto alguns os v em como loucos n s vemos g nios porque as pessoas loucas o bastante para acreditar que podem mudar o mundo s o as que o mudam
3406707 se uma rvore se quebra na floresta e n o houver nenhum ser humano na floresta para ouvir o ru do da queda da rvore ser que o ru do existe de facto
3406708 im very happy for the film it is doing well and i thank people for appreciating my film
3406709 minutes before the official announcement of pope benedicts election cardinal macharski points to the liberal reporters assembled in st
3406710 bring it i still help elect the popes around here last time i checked
3406711 macharski emboldened by the felicitous election of ratzinger jumps the gun and announces gaudium magnum annuntio urbi orbi et universo
3406712 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3406713 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3406714 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3406715 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3406716 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3406717 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3406718 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3406719 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3406720 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3406721 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3406722 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3406723 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3406724 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3406725 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3406726 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3406727 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3406728 this isnt just a career for me its my passion
3406729 the first part was a hit among children they were infatuated by the westernised ganesha in the sequel the ganesha has been given a more modern look and he speaks english fluently now please dont ask me to reveal the plot
3406730 when the song was being picturised on a street in mumbai a crowd of about 5 000 onlookers gathered there many of the children from the crowd joined in the procession and that made the scene look real
3406731 the movie has been telecast 53 times on tv since its release in july last year that itself is a proof of the fact that the concept was hit among children
3406732 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3406733 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3406734 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3406735 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3406736 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3406737 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3406738 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3406739 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3406740 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3406741 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3406742 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3406743 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3406744 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3406745 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3406746 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3406747 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3406748 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3406749 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3406750 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3406751 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3406752 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3406753 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3406754 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3406755 up to 22nd of this month it is expected to reach 25 475 workers fully trained in matters related to the electoral package procedures for voting and specific guidelines for ballot boxes chairmen
3406756 premier league clubs and players do so much to inspire and excite generally fans and the media are talking about the great goals and moments of skill in the barclays premier league
3406757 at times though and this came into sharp public focus last season incidents crop up where the mark is overstepped and player and manager behaviour can become unacceptable
3406758 in forging better relationships with team captains and the other players and by communicating their decisions in the right way it will help the players and that will make the game better for everyone fans included
3406759 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3406760 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3406761 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3406762 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3406763 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
3406764 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u
3406765 the principal challenge therefore is how to ensure that the capabilities gained and counterinsurgency lessons learned from iraq and afghanistan as well as the lessons relearned from other places where we have engaged in irregular warfare over the last two decades are institutionalized within the defense establishment
3406766 take the battle to the enemy disrupt his plans and confront the worst threats before they emerge
3406767 a vivid and compelling demonstration of americas ability to win swift and total victory
3406768 unequaled in its excellence by anything in the annals of war
3406769 that far surpasses the capabilities of such previous would be hegemons as rome britain and napoleonic france
3406770 fabled generals such as erwin rommel and heinz guderian seem positively incompetent by comparison
3406771 weve applied the new powers of technology to strike an enemy force with speed and incredible precision by a combination of creative strategies and advanced technologies we are redefining war on our terms in this new era of warfare we can target a regime not a nation
3406772 the american people fell in love again with their armed forces
3406773 whats the point of having this superb military that youre always talking about if we cant use it
3406774 appropriated the entire earth and was ready to flood the most obscure areas of it with troops at a moments notice
3406775 just about no mission is impossible for the united states military
3406776 es una esencia de la religi n verdadera en santiago 1 27
3406777 nintendo will dramatically transform wiis image with the release of ultra violent video game madworld which revolves around the themes of brutality and exhilaration according to its creators
3406778 dat doe je dus mooi niet dat is belachelijk veel geld voor iets wat je zelf ook kan
3406779 que la religi n es una expresi n de realidad material e injusticia econ mica
3406780 que la religi n fue usada por opresores para hacer la gente sentirse mejor la angustia que ellos experimentan debido a ser pobre y explotado
3406781 que la religi n es el opio de la gente
3406782 la religi n es el suspiro de la criatura oprimida
3406783 we have been taught that even if we screw up in life to hide it
3406784 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3406785 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3406786 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3406787 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3406788 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3406789 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3406790 the simple reason why orthodox priests wear beards is because as a nazarene our lord had a beard as can be seen from any icon since the priest is a dispenser of sacramental grace and an icon of christ he should physically resemble our lord in the roman empire it was the custom for men to shave not to shave was to be a barbarian i e not be a roman and therefore be culturally inferior this custom of shaving was particularly strong in the western part of the roman empire where rome was even in the eastern part of the empire beardless priests were still common up until the fifth century here however the sense of the physical appearance of christ and the need for clergy to resemble him dominated and in the east beardless clergy had disappeared by the eighth century at latest in the west hermits and monastics also had long hair and beards like st martin of tours however the parish clergy came to a kind of compromise although in order to avoid seeming effeminate western orthodox clergy did not shave they nevertheless trimmed their beards quite closely this is clear from icons of st leo the great or st gregory the great unfortunately this tradition of trimmed beards was lost with the tyranny of charlemagne at the end of the eighth century with his massive barbarian inferiority complex it was his desire in all things to imitate pagan classical rome it was therefore under him that western clergy were ordered to shave regularly for example at the council of aachen 816 it was stipulated that priests and monks were to shave every two weeks despite this until the beginning of the eleventh century most hermits and bishops too were still bearded nevertheless by the end of the eleventh century most priests and monks shaved regularly at least ten times a year if not much more frequently in particular in 1080 hildebrand pope gregory vii tried to enforce shaving all this was in pure imitation of the practices of pagan rome in the sixteenth century beardlessness for roman catholic clergy was enforced by further canons which appear to have been dropped since the second vatican council
3406791 ultimately it is the integration and coherence of halo 3s online content that makes the game stand apart from its theater mode to forge and the way a party playing through live can seamlessly manoeuvre between them here is an experience that demonstrates an unparalleled understanding of the potential for console online play
3406792 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3406793 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3406794 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3406795 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong
3406796 the 4870 x2 is more than a match for a single nvidia gtx 280 and depending on the title sometimes a match for two gtx 280s
3406797 drivers are now atis only weak area so the 4870 x2s performance and scaling with two 4870 x2s quadfire often varies widely from title to title
3406798 the select permission was denied on the object employee database employee schema dbo
3406799 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3406800 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3406801 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3406802 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3406803 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3406804 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3406805 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3406806 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3406807 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3406808 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3406809 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3406810 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3406811 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3406812 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3406813 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3406814 we have chinese girl 350 or thai girl 300 he said
3406815 most single cabinet surround systems typically require reflective walls to optimize a sonic image but with slimstage weve effectively removed this barrier by incorporating patented surround and speaker technologies that dont rely on walls or subwoofers to produce a pinpoint surround sound image and our patented technologies have allowed us to develop a super slim cabinet which unlike others has bass and nearly disappears on furniture or under a flat panel tv
3406816 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3406817 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3406818 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them

3406820 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3406821 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3406822 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3406823 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3406824 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3406825 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3406826 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3406827 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3406828 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3406829 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3406830 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3406831 what other movie does a better job of depicting hackers and hacking

3406837 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3406838 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3406839 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3406840 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3406841 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3406842 we the undersigned citizens of salisbury urge the selectmen not to hire frank jones as chief of police of salisbury if mr jones has been sworn in as chief we ask that you terminate his employment and begin a search for an appropriate candidate
3406843 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3406844 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3406845 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3406846 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3406847 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3406848 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3406849 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3406850 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3406851 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3406852 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed

3406867 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3406868 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3406869 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3406870 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3406871 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3406872 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3406873 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3406874 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3406875 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor

3406884 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3406885 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3406886 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3406887 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3406888 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3406889 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3406890 there are another four days to go on the auction and i expect to see people bid it up at the end

3406895 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3406896 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3406897 this is chinese territory you have to obey the rules
3406898 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices

3406905 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3406906 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors

3406972 the difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones
3406973 no one knows for sure what accounts for this but its a pretty smart hypothesis that the increased amount of near work that were doing as a population may be increasing the incidence of nearsightedness and it does suggest that we should be looking into ways to deal with it
3406974 i would hazard to suggest that in general the widespread prevalence of refractive issues today could be related to environmental factors like extensive use of tv and computers and among the young video games because today we get much heavier loads on our eyes from all of that and those are strenuous activities for our vision

3407037 in montreal it was very difficult it was still fresh after athens and i was still feeling a little bit hurt and still a little bit low
3407038 i just made some major changes to move from my coach ken wood to stephan widmer and it was still really difficult i think i was still searching for myself and was still finding my self worth and to believe in myself as a person
3407039 i think because i found out so much about myself and after athens i learnt so much and that was my first individual world championship so i think that one is still more important to me that this
3407040 olympic golds are important but in terms of personal experience in terms of personal growth i think that was my most important win
3407041 it has been a long journey it has been a long eight years and there was just a lot of relief that the training was definitely worth it
3407042 my journey has been fun i think it has been a good story jones said
3407043 i think this gold medal is probably for the believers and the people that i guess have stuck by me
3407044 its hard at the time to deal with criticism and i sure did cop a lot of it after athens and i think a lot of it was a bit of a misunderstanding it has made me a much stronger person and i think it has made this performance much sweeter
3407045 i was probably tearing up a bit behind the dais and i just got through it and once i saw my mum i lost it jones said
3407046 its hard not to those are the people that see you every day and they are the people who go through the hard days when you are throwing up in your front garden

3407051 to be tied for the most olympic gold with those names its a pretty amazing accomplishment
3407052 i didnt even know it was possible until earlier this year when bob bowman his coach told me
3407053 four years ago i just wanted to race those guys but i hate to lose and getting third in the 200m freestyle four years ago when i lose in circumstances like that it motivates me more to try to swim faster

3407077 this was not in my opinion one of them it was never seriously considered in any way shape or form
3407078 there were lots of long running debates within the campaign about strategy this was not one of them
3407079 i dont ever remember having a lengthy or serious conversation about this none of her advisers supported this approach when presented with it
3407080 in fairness to mark i dont remember him particularly pushing it
3407081 olympic golds are important but in terms of personal experience in terms of personal growth i think they were my most important swims
3407082 she pretty much lives for my swimming so this was her reward
3407083 if it had have been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3407084 i think you have got to put a lot of that down to the preoccupation with security
3407085 and they havent been able to manage the balance between security and creating that atmosphere
3407086 today s announcement demonstrates the value of playxpert widgets and the power of an ecosystem of companies who build them to cater to the player s in game experiences

3407088 the child on camera had to be flawless in looks in her feelings and in her expression

3407091 when lin miaoke was singing on friday she may not have realised that was not her own voice
3407092 mostly an animated three dimensional video that was made over a year it was not actually live footage except the final stage
3407093 looking at it from today the video was a bit brighter than the real fireworks but most viewers thought it was live so we succeeded in the effect we had wanted
3407094 mine felt pretty good and i popped up and looked over at melissa to see what her face was telling me and then looked up at the scoreboard to see we were ranked two so it is a good feeling
3407095 i am actually older in terms of months than them the chinese
3407096 everyone talks about me as being young but i think i have grown up a lot since the commonwealth games and i think i just fit into the team
3407097 i was pretty nervous going in but briony was helping me calm my nerves and chatting and trying to keep it light just like training
3407098 she just said something about having the force something silly like that just to break the tension and it worked
3407099 melissa and i have a really good relationship both as friends and as synchro partners i have total trust in her and she trusts me and once i say ready go it is all about focusing on what you need to do in the dive
3407100 i know that melissa is an awesome diver and she trusts me to do my best and it works
3407101 she is the most mature 16 year old that i know she has got a great head on her shoulders but i always keep a big sister watchful eye on her and check that she is being normal and relaxed as much as she can so it is more of a big sister thing

3407115 theres a real problem that the bigger retailers will be able to spread the risk but at this point independent retailers could be at a disadvantage and it could deliver even less competition over the longer term
3407116 the dream ive been working for is all of a sudden right in front of me
3407117 the last week the boys were really good to me and have welcomed me into the team
3407118 it wasnt as much pressure as i thought it would have been but thats because of the boys and the way theyve treated me over the last week
3407119 ive just got to take it as it comes and hopefully ill be back during this year some time and to help the boys get a win
3407120 hay que tener lealtad a la hora de hacer los planteamientos y no utilizar una cuesti n como forma de presi n para conseguir otros objetivos

3407132 i was in georgia long enough to pick up the language and the talk among the locals about the political situation with the russians wasnt good
3407133 i do hope the situation doesnt get any worse than it already is
3407134 watching what is happening over there on the television is just unbelievable
3407135 ive still got a lot of good friends in the city who ive been in touch with on a daily basis
3407136 the phones into the city for now are still working and ive also been able to send text messages to a few of the team
3407137 i was told just this morning that while the russian soldiers havent reached the capital yet it could be only a matter of time
3407138 the players at dinamo have told me they can see and hear the bombs going off in the mountains above tbilisi
3407139 there is a military airport very close to the stadium and an army base as well my former team mates say the situation is worsening by the hour
3407140 ive had emails from the georgian rugby union over the last couple of days
3407141 they are just continuing as normal and hoping everything will get resolved its not a great situation thats for sure
3407142 they said if there is any danger they wouldnt get me back in october i wouldnt go back if there was still the possibility of war
3407143 our next test against russia will be a heated one
3407144 the last time we played them there were three all in brawls
3407145 i enjoyed every minute of my time at dinamo i was asked to stay on for another season and while the contract was very tempting i just had this sense that it was best i didnt stay
3407146 the tension between georgia and russia had been coming for some time
3407147 ive got a wife irena and two kids a daughter aged nine victoria and a two year old son matteo to think about
3407148 but i thought enough is enough it was time for me to give the game away and start concentrating on other things

3407153 pese a mover cerca de 3 billones de pesos al a o
3407154 por eso deben tratar de mantener a toda costa el control del negocio la piedra angular de esa pelea es el manejo de la formulaci n del m dico
3407155 a los primeros se les costea la asistencia a congresos y simposios pasajes alimentaci n alojamiento a los segundos se les da la oportunidad de ser conferencistas en eventos de alto nivel en los que tienen la posibilidad de interactuar con pares acad micos o de participar en investigaciones con los terceros hay incluso negociaci n directa si produce formula cierto n mero de unidades al d a eso puede significarle una suma mensual que se gira a cuentas personales o de terceros para que l no figure

3407158 ellos costean todo incluso me han hecho llegar im genes y diapositivas para incluir en las presentaciones eso lo cobro por honorarios

3407160 primus has indicated to us that it isnt going to be our major sponsor however they are still going to be involved with our footy club next year we have to broaden our revenue base and this gives us the opportunity
3407161 we would obviously love to keep them at the top level but theyve indicated to us and weve been talking to them all year about this prospect in fact paul mcnamee started with it
3407162 its not news to us and fortunately we havent lost them completely
3407163 in a manner which substantially cuts short the lap distance
3407164 im just running on a bit of stress and adrenalin at the moment its all catching up with me
3407165 the key thing is athletes need to be able to manage the pressure not ignore it
3407166 if they put in their best performance and they get a disappointing result it is easier to deal with if they get distracted by external events and turn in a poor result then it is much harder to manage
3407167 the visibility was not all that great it was dark which made the targets look even smaller in fact but you know it is the same for everybody and the better guy handled it easier on the day
3407168 so the only two that we were hoping for medal winners were certainly hackett and michael but he did very very well to come fourth in hot weather one day and then rain the next
3407169 i think his was a wonderful wonderful performance but he is an olympic champion and you always keep your hopes up for those

3407172 no i prefer the humility and the dependence in your weakness to the pride in your strength keep it

3407174 excessive use of force by indian security forces against the kashmiri people and called for an immediate end to violence in jammu and kashmir

3407182 if youre poisonous its to your advantage to advertise that to your predators
3407183 what its telling us is you should go ahead and sample the plant im eating to search for pharmaceutical compounds
3407184 this is the first time that anyone has proven that brightly coloured insects associate with active plants more than they do with inactive plants
3407185 one could go into the field and scan wild insect populations
3407186 this would still be labour intensive but would hopefully increase your hit rate in comparison to randomly collecting plants
3407187 intact ecosystems are what allow this type of facilitated search to take place
3407188 if you can say that we would have not found this plant unless wed used this insect that creates an incentive to conserve insect species as well as the plant species

3407191 why cant the authorities be more flexible about tickets for instance yesterday many people in the audience left the stadium after the chinese womens volleyball match thinking the tickets were for one game only
3407192 but when they found there was another game they were not allowed back in if they wanted to return
3407193 the next game featured the japanese team and there was a big japanese crowd waiting outside hoping for tickets
3407194 we are concerned about the fact we do not have full stadia
3407195 if local venue managers find there are too many empty seats they arrange for local volunteers as cheerleaders and they are told to cheer for both teams to create a better atmosphere
3407196 if the ticket holders turn up then they get up and go
3407197 no we dont need to seek an apology if wearing a mask does someone good let them do it if the air is fine theyll take it off
3407198 i think it was a natural progression for me to start designing shoes as a designer as well as a businessman shoes are so important every woman loves shoes right
3407199 you have to have glamour even if its for everyday use there has to be some glamour i believe that if you work hard you have to enjoy it love yourself first
3407200 they are very signature zang toi with a platinum bow or trims i dont want my shoes to be just a collection for display i want them to fly off the shelves
3407201 i heard that one lady bought six pairs of my shoes one in every colour thats fantastic
3407202 i think my malaysian ness shows in the bright colours that i use you know the bright local indian colours that many westerners are afraid to use
3407203 im very excited to be in partnership with larrie they make beautiful shoes at a level of quality that i can be proud of
3407204 i love designing for people who love dressing up that i find most pleasurable it does not have to be a celebrity a fine example is my mother she is in her 80s and still every time i come home with clothes for her i can see the sparkle in her eye my mum is the most generous lady i know but not when it comes to her clothes no one can come near her clothes
3407205 even if it is just for a couple of days
3407206 i have been living in new york for 27 years now and i still think its the greatest city in the world i travel a lot and i am still so excited every time i come home each time the airplane touches down on jfk or newark airports i am as excited as a little kid
3407207 new york is just crazy and full of energy you just cant get the same feeling anywhere else in the world
3407208 i have just started running recently i usually run in central park and in fact just before i came here i ran the whole loop round the park a six mile run in just under an hour yes i did it in 55 minutes i find that i now get some of my best work done when i am running
3407209 i want to establish zang toi as a truly luxurious fashion house one of my favourite companies and labels is hermes trends come and go but hermes is always about top quality i want my brand to be just like that
3407210 i am lucky enough to be able to enjoy the best things to be able to walk into the best restaurants in new york without a reservation to stay at the ritz in paris i love it and i enjoy luxury but it is not for show i do it because it gives me pleasure but its no big deal whats most important to me is my family and my close friends i credit my family for keeping me grounded i come from a very simple and humble family
3407211 i did turn around and look at the referee because one of them i thought clearly he missed it i dont think anyone in the squad out there thought he hit it
3407212 i think there were some calls there not for me but for some of the other competitors that i would be a bit worried about
3407213 if it had have been for a gold medal i would have been protesting i would say its tough because all the referees have to be all in unison and there was a lot of doubt over a lot of the shots out there today
3407214 i hope not i would hate to say that but i mean you just get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses it the shooters can all tell if hes hit it or missed it and everybody stopped
3407215 im glad that wasnt for a gold medal because thats what these games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3407216 id say towards the end there he may have been a brave chinese referee to put his hand up but it didnt determine the medals luckily
3407217 they cant be inexperienced to be refereeing here they have got to have gone through a fairly stringent process so they cant give that as an excuse im afraid
3407218 seriously i think the position i finished today is well above what i am in the world to be honest
3407219 oh god i dont want to have kids for like 10 years i still have a lot to do i dont even know if i could handle a dog right now im so not ready someday ill be a mom but not until im in my 30s

3407221 wow some of these photos arent very good well that one of the dog is pretty cool
3407222 well the problem with the kid photos are that theyre hoping the cuteness of the kid will make up for the lack of anything to grasp your eye
3407223 yeah you too a shot like that when we went to quarry park with hershey
3407224 wow thats like the exact same spot and everything woah that made 2nd honors
3407225 the other person wanted to race me so i did
3407226 i saw a fella in a white ute pull up and he started revving me up we took off and next thing i know i was getting pulled over

3407239 many officials in the u s government who have worked on the russia relationship in recent years said president bush lionized mr saakashvili as a model for democracy in the region to a point that the georgian leader may have held unrealistic expectations about the amount of support he might receive from the u s and the west
3407240 the bush administration didnt in any way encourage georgian president mikhail saakashvilis move against the russians but it didnt do enough to rein him in
3407241 it encouraged the creation of a georgian president who was too big for his britches
3407242 sized up the moral bankruptcy of the western left they know that half a million europeans would turn out to their patron the united states for removing a dictator and fostering democracy but not more than a half dozen would do the same to criticize their long time enemy from bombing a constitutional state
3407243 indeed tired of european lectures the russians are now telling the world that soft power is well soft
3407244 more likely putin amp co figure that any popular rhetoric about justice will be trumped by european governments concern for energy with just a few tanks and bombs in one fell swoop russia has cowered its former republics made them think twice about joining the west and stopped nato and maybe eu expansion in their tracks after all who wants to die for tbilisi
3407245 instead europe both western and eastern along with the united states and the concerned former soviet republics need to sit down conference and plot exactly how these new democracies are to maintain their independence and autonomy in the next decade

3407260 over the last 15 years weve done a great job on focusing on our residential programs and now were working on our businesses
3407261 those are good numbers compared to other states but we feel we can do better
3407262 there are some restaurants that have purchased seven or eight carts from us
3407263 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3407264 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3407265 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3407266 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3407267 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3407282 afecta a la propia estabilidad del psoe y por tanto a la propia estabilidad del gobierno en un momento de crisis econ mica
3407283 lo peor que nos puede pasar a todos los espa oles es que encima los apoyos del gobierno est n divididos
3407284 ha generado un l o muy importante dentro de su propio partido

3407362 it is vital cica understand that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3407363 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3407364 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3407365 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3407366 therefore the mechanism is in place for all applicants to express that they are not content when their decision letter is sent to them

3407374 if you were to have a shooter with an assault rifle on top of a building or even in the middle of the green and the police officers could not adequately respond to that with a handgun does a citizen want them to adequately respond to that danger or do they not im not sure that thats a military response
3407375 remember these are not cases where we may have witnesses recant their statements later these are all cases made by undercover police officers

3407382 all i know is that we wanted to try one field using the organic treatment product
3407383 that particular product we felt was not effective and decided to stop using it
3407384 i think that the school district generally had an unrealistic view of the treatment
3407385 within the first application of any lawn it needs to be watered and i dont think they did that
3407386 im not going to dispute potters comments on watering the field
3407387 if i were him i would protect my product by making that claim i cant prove or disprove the claim on watering and not watering and neither can he

3407390 compared to the rest of the campus its definitely better
3407391 the question you want to ask yourself is what are they doing for that amount of money
3407392 we did get the okay from the school board to spot treat areas using a chemical treatment in order to get ready for the school year
3407393 but we really want to stay with the policy of only using organic treatments

3407436 on a street circuit the problem is there is no grip at the beginning
3407437 on a normal circuit you learn it in 15 or 10 laps even but on a street circuit it is going to take you longer than that so maybe 20 laps to get the hang of it
3407438 it is going to be very important to keep the car on the track because if you crash you are going to lose a lot of time on track
3407439 im going to watch the on board from some of the gt racing and things like that to get a good idea of the track but it is then really taking a guess on the set up and comparing to other street circuits like monaco
3407440 then from there you just have to take it step by step through the weekend
3407441 we started doing some initial mapping of the circuit several months ago from architect plans and fia information that we were given
3407442 so we do a rough map of the circuit and then we run our simulation around it to see things like aero levels and look at the potential for high brake wear or what kind of demands the circuit will put on the tyres
3407443 so in the case of aero levels for instance we can make new parts to suit that particular circuit
3407444 perhaps the increase has something to do with the british climate which keeps many people indoors

3407571 what its telling us is you should go ahead and sample the plant im eating to search for pharmaceutical compounds
3407572 this is the first time that anyone has proven that brightly coloured insects associate with active plants more than they do with inactive plants
3407573 one could go into the field and scan wild insect populations
3407574 this would still be labour intensive but would hopefully increase your hit rate in comparison to randomly collecting plants
3407575 intact ecosystems are what allow this type of facilitated search to take place
3407576 if you can say that we would have not found this plant unless wed used this insect that creates an incentive to conserve insect species as well as the plant species

3407621 fuelwatch is dead just forget about it its all over

3407635 good news that mr medvedev had ordered a halt to military action
3407636 russia must reverse the course it appears to be on he said on his return from the beijing olympics
3407637 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3407638 its perfectly normal that russia would want to defend the interests both of russians in russia and russophones outside russia mr sarkozy said
3407639 it is also normal for the international community to want to guarantee the integrity sovereignty and independence of georgia

3407657 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3407671 among adults with vision problems a public health gap exists in actual access to eye care services between canada and the united states primarily owing to the population without health insurance in the united states
3407672 the difference in use of eye care services between americans without health insurance and canadians narrowed when adjusted for income level and was almost eliminated when adjusted for having optional vision insurance
3407673 therefore public health interventions targeting adults with vision problems without health insurance might be more beneficial if they focused on those at risk for serious vision loss especially those in the lowest income group
3407674 disenfranchising voters is not just a new buzzword or catchall phrase to cover up sloppy petition gathering practices the election law requirements are to prevent fraud deception confusion and threats to the integrity of the system to turn a blind eye toward the blatant disregard of the process and statutory requirements would divest the voters of the confidence they have in the law
3407675 lacking the necessary number of signatures the petition is invalidated and the board of elections is enjoined restrained and prohibited from putting the name of the respondent candidate craig johnson on the official ballots to be used at the sept 9 2008 working families party primary election
3407676 its crystal clear that there was a blatant disregard of the election law and this is just a devastating blow to a faltering campaign first he didnt get the independence party line now hes lost the working families line and next hes going to lose this election

3407700 i remember her changing her name to carl to play in a tournament because girls werent allowed to play i saw her putting her ponytail under her helmet so nobody would know she was a girl i saw all that theres someone who plays hockey for the love of the game
3407701 and its not just cammi but all the girls who played in the first olympics and world championships they didnt play for any other reason except they loved the game what they did for the womens game and womens sports you cant take your hats off enough
3407702 why not when she was a little girl she said im going to play for the blackhawks what do you mean youre going to play for the blackhawks well why not
3407703 she heard you cant play in the tournament she said well why not im a good player so all along thats the way it was she taught me a lot about the fire inside the drive to motivate yourself

3407717 its really hard to handle people with these types of health issues in court because you need to show they have a culpable state of mind
3407718 what we hear is if you still have outstanding credit you can get the money but if youre marginal and thought you had good credit under the looser rules of the past those companies are having a hard time getting the cash they need even though they have great ideas for expansion they need to borrow money but theyre being told no
3407719 the federal reserve is freeing up vast amounts of money to help the banks but the fed can only do so much too much money pumped into the economy will drive up inflation at the same time businesses are finding it harder to borrow which threatens overall economic activity its a fine line
3407720 financial experts say up to nearly a trillion dollars of debt will eventually be erased from the books as financial institutions around the globe get their balance sheets back in order
3407721 studies show for every dollar lost its 10 to 15 times that amount no longer able to find its way into the marketplace as much needed credit thats up to 15 trillion no longer available to businesses worldwide
3407722 its exactly like draining all of the oil out of your engine credit is the lubricant of our global economy and we still have a leak in the oil pan
3407723 the risk is higher and you may lose control of your business
3407724 the longer they keep the dollar weak the more inflation they build up you cant have it both ways you have to take the pain sometime

3407742 large and prospective studies are required to verify whether 11c pib pet will become a tool in diagnosing alzheimers disease another potential use of 11c pib would be the quantitative monitoring of beta amyloid deposits in the brain in subjects under treatment in pharmaceutical trials of early alzheimers disease targeting amyloid accumulation

3407744 as chinese manufacturers feed a growing global appetite for cheap goods these exports account for a rising share of the countrys greenhouse gas emissions a new study reveals exports are now responsible for one third of chinas emissions according to a study that will appear in the journal energy policy the researchers describe their analysis as the most systematic study of the subject to date in 2005 the most recent year for which data are available china emitted an estimated 1 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent during production of its exports this is a steady increase from the estimated 230 million tons from exports in 1987 which represented 12 percent of the countrys net emissions the study said

3407746 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
3407747 take the famous ice core data this was the jewel in the crown of global warming theory al gore said it proved a link between carbon dioxide and temperature he failed to mention that in the data the connection was clearly the wrong way round temperature driving co2 levels not the other way round
3407748 but if you take all the chemistry thermal dymanics and theiries about carbon etc and take them down to basic priciples and back them up by the last hundred years of research and scientific findings then you update them with the mass of evidence from all of the recent studies if you do all this and you link to the studies the scientists and all of this is backed by facts the global warming hoax people

3407753 nasa has put off the planned launch of its next generation orion spacecraft for a year a setback to efforts to get a successor to its aging space shuttles off the ground sooner rather than later the space agency announced monday september 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the orion program manager jeff hanley told reporters in a conference call monday

3407757 our world our old world that we have inhabited for the last 12 000 years has ended even if no newspaper in north america or europe has yet printed its scientific obituary this february while cranes were hoisting cladding to the 141st floor of the burj dubai tower which will soon be twice the height of the empire state building the stratigraphy commission of the geological society of london was adding the newest and highest story to the geological column although the idea of the anthropocene an earth epoch defined by the emergence of urban industrial society as a geological force has been long debated stratigraphers have refused to acknowledge compelling evidence for its advent
3407758 when the war on drugs succeeds and cocaine prices rise you dont see the drug czar proposing government subsidies for addicts i dont like his mission but at least hes honest on this point hes not out there disrupting supplies one day and then helping addicts pay for their fixes the next the same cant be said however of warriors on oil addiction consider green businessman joseph p kennedy ii his nonprofit citizens energy corporation pushes an environmentalist agenda of reduced energy use wind power and carbon offsets but it also has a campaign of giving discount heating oil to the poor and elderly you might have seen its ads on tv such as the one where a poverty stricken mother and child freezing in their unheated home is saved by joe and his delivery truck bringing them oil at 40 percent off but why is joe bringing them oil at all let alone cheap oil shouldnt he be bringing them solar panels or manuals on energy conservation or perhaps a gold star for this familys low carbon footprint
3407759 consumer anger about rising fuel prices has taken a while to build because until the last year or so the increases could be shrugged off as natural year to year price variation moreover pump prices still seemed relatively cheap given increases in personal wealth personal disposable income since 2000 for instance has increased by an average of about 4 800 a person those very real increases in economic well being reduced the pain of higher prices at the pump people didnt notice that real gas prices were higher because the percentage of their income going to the gas station was at an all time low until recently the bad news for politicians is that motorists are noticing now

3407780 as expected our investment in new stores in houston dallas and st louis added additional revenue and operating expenses which contributed to the loss in the quarter and six months
3407781 we may continue to operate at a loss and our cash on hand may decrease as a result of the early operating losses at the new stores until they achieve the test volume necessary to break even we are working extremely hard with our new store projects and look to improve on our results going forward

3407783 our results could contribute to the development of targeted therapies and thus improve the treatment of cerebellar tumours in children
3407784 but for that to be possible we first need to understand the principles of how the tumours develop
3407785 if we know how a tumour arises at the molecular level we can also develop specific therapies that actually treat the cause of that particular condition
3407786 normally the signalling pathway ensures a balance of growth and maturation of cells
3407787 but if disrupted it can lead to uncontrolled growth of cells and thus the onset of cancer
3407788 all of our studies have shown that medulloblastomas can only develop from granule cells and their progenitors
3407789 other cells on the other hand such as the large purkinje cells of the cerebellum do not become tumourigenic they dont seem bothered by these mutations at all
3407790 but we also found olig2 in progenitors of the granule cells of the cerebellum and in tumour cells
3407791 that means this protein also influences the formation and multiplication of cancer cells which makes it clear once again just how closely normal and malignant development processes resemble one another we hope our results will contribute to a targeted therapy for medulloblastomas that will require further research however which we already have in the planning
3407792 has appropriately raised serious concerns about the safety of prescribing over the internet
3407793 outperformed the traditional system in most of the safety variables tested
3407794 innovation technology and current medical practice all factor into the outcome of this study
3407795 application of an expert interview system specifically targeted to erectile dysfunction along with a continuous platform for patient client physician communications make this particular internet system comparable to traditional medical practice
3407796 consider using the regulatory model of oversight protections implemented by the state of utah to license internet prescribing companies
3407797 from top to bottom this has been a great experience
3407798 there is no doubt this has been a very positive event for the community

3407804 should soon find support despite the setback in crude oil prices and a steadier dollar
3407805 highly correlated with the dollar negatively and oil prices positively
3407806 several factors suggest that gold should soon find support and begin to edge higher in both absolute terms and relative to oil specifically the setback in crude prices will help to alleviate inflation angst at the major central banks

3407813 theyre constantly bombarded by messages how to dress what makeup to wear but also how to behave and how to think i grew up with three brothers and come from the primarily male dominated stand up comedy world but now i have two young daughters and i have found how important it is for them to shrug off those messages and believe in themselves and love themselves for the people they are inside i hope this movie contributes a little to helping them understand how important that is
3407814 i was working just across the river and looked across at the landslip and said thats my van

3407816 i have decided to stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3407817 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its armed forces have been disorganised

3407819 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes

3407829 forum poster you say that performance has turned around 100 when you still have a massive memory leak which causes people to crash multiple times per play session the lord i was referring to the performance increase from late beta to launch the difference there was staggering much because we chose to focus our coder power on increasing the performance really for anyone who played the beta the difference in performance between launch and a month before launch is incredible i think most people appreciate that we prioritized that
3407830 1500 armor sets these are all in the game the biggest problem is that not all of them are used well enough in the game through drops quest rewards etc we are doing major work right now making sure these are distributed as they should be the item team is putting a lot of effort into this

3407834 while a big juicy steak may indeed be culinary nirvana for many your taste for beef could be based in part on expectation rather than reality on the assumption that meat is associated with social power in some peoples minds researchers rated study participants on what they call a social power value endorsement measure to determine their preferences for meat and their cultural perceptions of it participants were then told they would taste either a beef sausage roll or a vegetarian roll you can guess where this is headed
3407835 my work is a series of color photographs that work to stimulate unconscious emotions desires and sexual compulsions all unified within a dynamic that vacillates between the real and the fantasized i explore issues related to madness and alienation as they exist in contemporary culture concentrating on expressions of neurosis on feelings of anxiety displacement and loss of identity these emotions are depicted in terms of visual conflict through my imagery and manifested in terms of grotesque exaggeration while investigating issues related to the unconscious elements such as eroticism twisted humor and horror come across i strive to create dichotomies between the sensual and the horrific the beautiful and the destructive the result i hope is a body of work comprised of deeply emotional and disturbing depictions of the unknown staged imagery that functions on a metaphorical level and inanimate objects and settings serving to illustrate the inner workings of the unconscious cropped image original image nsfw nearly everyone has experienced some sort of traumatic disconnect in their lives whether it is a severance within the body self or a break from family or friends much hysteria is rooted in such traumatic experience one that cannot be integrated into a persons understanding of the world freud in beyond the pleasure principle states often times we tend to repeat a traumatic event over and over even until it becomes pleasurable this repetition contradicts our instinct to seek pleasure but regardless our mind has a tendency to repeat traumatic events in order to deal with them as a way of mastering them this repetition can take the form of dreams storytelling or even hallucination my images allude to the cryptic mental re scrambling through which our traumatic events resurface when i conceive my images the questions i ask myself are what is the state of normality how can that normality be subverted perverted or generally transformed when does this overcome the real and become psychotic my work attempts to play on these feelings of instability the subjects that i use some friends some strangers are placed into often awkward bizarre set pieces and coerced into visually compelling poses various websites craigslist etc became a way of enlisting others into my shoots i use the photography medium as way of documenting the experience of these performance pieces an example of this would be smearing chocolate syrup all over a strangers legs and asking him to climb into a dryer they might be completely covered with glitter or have their head stuffed in an uncomfortable place

3407843 the borough council has put in cycle paths and walkways and people do walking
3407844 i dont think theres something in the water its just good wholesome food and plenty of exercise
3407845 one of the things about life expectancy is that it brings together a whole load of factors
3407846 it has something to do with the ballymoney area it has something to do with services available the type of environment it is but also its got a lot to do with the history of the people who live there
3407847 many of the things that affect peoples health occurred earlier in life and the effects accumulate over time what is it thats happening in ballymoney which lead them to this relatively high life expectancy
3407848 urban areas can tend to have higher mortality rates than rural areas simply because urban areas are where health services exist so sick people tend to congregate towards urban areas
3407849 social problems would also be a contributing factor to life expectancy

3407852 the concept of operation immortality is much more than a theme to an online game the earths population needs to quickly adjust our behavior regarding global warming or else fiction quickly becomes our new reality when we learned that richard garriott will be conducting environmental research while in space the stars all aligned to support him

3407888 february 15 1943 i was hired in a semi skilled occupation in a unionized defense factory im certain demographics had some bearing on my being hired since the demand for healthy white male employees was far greater then the supply but the truth is i was hired because of the labor union activity and the agitation of the philip randolph period let me tell you that from beginning to end it was pure utopia beginning with the plant guard who gave us new hires our in plant orientation he told us not to take any crap from anybody that we were just as good as anyone else that we should holler louder if we even thought we were denied something of value because of our skin color and that we should get our fair share of all handouts i couldnt believe it it was simple incredible here was this white man telling me about brotherhood equality and fraternity after i had suffered a lifetime of blatant over discrimination

3408025 i keep getting asked about the scene with the splits
3408026 yeah right or was it cgi of course they grafted my face on to olga korbuts body
3408027 i just did the splits on instinct thats what always happens with my acting as an actor youre not allowed to think i couldnt do the splits for you right now
3408028 i was so sick and tired of everything when i called you last night from glasgow
3408029 i havent got a career that im building when i swim my 55 laps i try to remember the movies ive been in order and i cant the past is just a miasma theres no career path
3408030 i just want to do things that are valuable to introduce into the culture
3408031 this film mamma mia is a valuable thing i knew it when i saw it
3408032 everybody was really dimmed spiritually after 9 11 i thought what am i going to do with the kids so i took all these 10 year olds to see a matinee of mamma mia they walked in and they sat there with their heads in their hands dimmed is the word they were sad all the time you know the first part was really wordy and then dancing queen started up and for the rest of the show they were dancing on their chairs and they were so so happy we all went out of the theatre floating on the air i thought what a gift to new york right now
3408033 judy had seen me as mother courage in tony kushners production of bertolt brechts mother courage and her children in central park the year before last thats what made her know i was destined to be donna
3408034 its a requirement of popular culture that you strike an ironic distance this doesnt its a film about women and their whole experiences being hopeful and youthful and older and suffering the regrets that you have over a long life its visceral and i love that
3408035 and you know what i think that pauline was a poor jewish girl who was at berkeley with all these rich pasadena wasps with long blonde hair and the heartlessness of them got her and then years later she sees me
3408036 pauline had a visceral dislike of me and theres no movie i could have done to stop that she made up a person that im not
3408037 to the extent she does deflect attention from the body to the head its not just in the interest of accents hair gimmicks its because the lady thinks her characters can have more than one idea in their heads at a time
3408038 i see myself in everybody i play i think im like them i really do
3408039 what i try to do is deepen the humanity of each woman that i play
3408040 it comes from some kind of aggrieved part of my childhood where i felt disregarded not by my parents so that i needed to question things and show a woman who is saying im not what i look like im a different thing ive played so many different women of different ages and everybody always mentions all those different accents i do but im always playing different aspects of me im not looking it up in a book
3408041 whistle blowers union organisers anthropologists hookers and writers with raised consciousnesses in movies of substance that would never get past a story conference today
3408042 womens real change in our society has been disruptive but feels evolutionarily necessary so now 60 of the kids in college are women more than 50 of medical students are women theyre not at the top in government and business but there is real change and i think that has terrified everybody its terrified men and its terrified women
3408043 i wont be sexy if im this even though i want to be paid an equal amount i still want to appear sexy i still want to appear fragile so ill lose weight thats my theory about what women are doing anyway
3408044 there were strong women in cinema played by women like barbara stanwyck hepburn and crawford who were allowed to be strong and dominate movies because they were in no way a threat in the real world the characters they played were a fantasy basically women were at home when the second world war in which women had been working and liked working was over in the 50s suddenly there was marilyn monroe jill st john and brigitte bardot because women could not be seen as strong any more and that was because in the real world it was no longer just a fantasy that there were strong women
3408045 i think its the opposite its an unusual film because its very hard for men to feel through a female protagonist to feel their way to what a woman feels but men just dont want to do it who knows why maybe its just uncomfortable for them but with the devil wears prada many men loved the priestly character because they thought thats me im misunderstood all i want to do is run things cleanly and clear away the bullshit a lot of people feel that underappreciated in the job they do but its so rare for men to empathise with a womans plight
3408046 the relationship between men and women is key to whats going on
3408047 i think its really behind a lot of what we call fundamentalism
3408048 i was thinking of the pope saying women cant be priests thats fundamentalism i dont understand that i really dont i dont feel lesser im very strong and capable and smart and i cant imagine why youve got to be led to heaven by your husband i just dont get it
3408049 well we can all stay friends and have sex it seems to me

3408062 i read your comments and articles about rachel oliver and can tell you exactly why she has more traffic in australia than anywhere else i know her very well she was involved for over 5 years in a legitimate successful and long standing mlm business and did quite well for a while she had enormous trouble duplicating her efforts very important in mlm and therefore could not gain sufficient traction in her business to sustain profit or growth she was introduced to the secret by her well meaning mentors when she was going through a tough time with her business and then totally disregarded the help and support they had given her for 5 years and jumped ship to ll she made many friends in her previous business and she has almost single handedly poached as many of those people as possible through insidious emails declaring her changing of email address and similar emails all of her emails of course have her new business card and income claims she claimed she would never do that people looked up to her as a leader in this previous business and then naturally assume there is something wrong with our company hence she has literally deceived and manipulated hundreds of people in australia amp new zealand because they put her in a position of trust i feel sorry for her and those who have blindly followed her honesty loyalty and fair play are not words or life choices shes familiar with shame on rachel oliver

3408076 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3408077 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3408078 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3408079 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3408080 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3408081 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking

3408086 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen

3408088 there were many people in this area of cowes at the time because of the fireworks display and im appealing for anyone with information or who saw what happened to contact police
3408089 its not working out i like you but you are not what i want i hope we can still be friends by the way you might wanna ask deja if you can bunk with her this weekend because i think it would be awkward if you stayed with me bye
3408090 susunan kandungan al quran apabila dipindah dalam bentuk grafik sama ada berupa carta atau arus gelombang elektronik ia tetap memaparkan bentuk imej yang menakjubkan termasuk membentuk kalimah allah dan muhammad
3408091 namun orang islam hari ini berhadapan dengan masalah yang sangat gawat walaupun al quran di sisi dan dimiliki untuk memandu mereka
3408092 hampir hampir satu kaum itu mengeroyok kamu seperti orang orang yang kelaparan mengeroyok dulang makanan lalu aku bertanya nabi adakah bilangan kami ketika itu sedikit jawab nabi tidak kamu ketika itu ramai tetapi kamu adalah seperti buih
3408093 ini semua gara gara orang islam sekarang tidak gemar membaca dan mengkaji al quran untuk membongkar isi kandungan ayat ayat nya serta tidak beramal dengan nya
3408094 mereka belajar al quran bukan untuk mengetahui isi kandungan kitab allah dan mengamalkannya jauh sekali untuk mengkaji al quran untuk membongkar rahsia alam dan sains bagi manfaat kehidupan ummah sejagat
3408095 sebab itu umat muslim semakin gawat jadi adalah penting untuk setiap muslim kembali mendekati al quran dan sentiasa membaca memahami serta mengkajinya secara serius
3408096 allah swt mewahyukan al quran kepada nabi muhammad saw bagi umat islam adalah sebagai penawar atau jalan keluar daripada masalah yang gawat
3408097 al quran banyak membicarakan soal sains fizik kimia biologi psikologi astronomi matematik dan seluruh alam serta isinya untuk manusia fikir kaji dan menyelongkarnya
3408098 dr mohammad al mahdi dr jerry lang dan profesor ibrahim hanyalah segelintir saintis barat yang meyakini islam kerana mengkaji al quran dan sains serta menjadi muslim

3408185 yeah we had a game plan for him but it didnt matter
3408186 hes a force on the court he can score with both hands and hes so strong he had a so so game 1 against us and i knew someone was gonna light a fire under his ass there was nothing we could do in game 2

3408197 you can give c booz the ball and hell get it done hes developed into a great player
3408198 he got the name c booz from me in eighth grade i gave him his swag i was the point guard he was the center and we used to kill people im happy to see hes having such great success in the league now
3408199 i do believe that im in that elite group of power forwards in the game but thats not enough for me

3408261 concretamente cuando lleg el expediente el tribunal oral hizo un control de la prescripci n de instrucci n y verific que el juez de instrucci n hab a omitido tomar indagatoria con relaci n a un hecho que se hab a denunciado de lesiones
3408262 advirti que no se le hab an dado facultades que prev el c digo de procedimientos a la defensa en cuanto a la posibilidad de oponerse a la elevaci n
3408263 entonces remarc como consecuencia de esas dos omisiones totalmente subsanables fue remitido nuevamente la causa al juez de instrucci n para que enmiende las mismas
3408264 una vez subsanadas a m s tardar en 60 d as se vuelve a elevar a juicio y tramitar en el tribunal oral
3408265 esto es un procedimiento normal que sucede con todo tipo de causas se han hecho valoraciones subjetivas con relaci n a las medidas procesales que no tienen otro inter s m s que hacer cumplir las normas del c digo de procedimiento
3408266 esto lo resolvi el tribunal oral con los magistrados que lo integran se emiti una resoluci n donde se puso de manifiesto esto se devolvi nuevamente a la dra l pez lest n jueza de instrucci n de la causa para subsanar estos inconvenientes
3408267 en el relato del procesamiento se nombra a esta persona los certificados m dicos pero en la imputaci n completa de toda la cantidad de personas se omiti poner el nombre

3408278 por residuos de los anteriores grupos paramilitares por grupos no desmovilizados y por nuevas bandas delincuenciales
3408279 la caracter stica com n a todos ellos es que su principal motivaci n es obtener ganancias del narcotr fico y sustraer rentas de una gran variedad de actividades il citas
3408280 las bandas emergentes no tienen una din mica contrainsurgente y no tienen como objetivo importante el de ser una fuerza de contenci n de los grupos guerrilleros
3408281 han desaparecido las disputas territoriales y las confrontaciones armadas entre los grupos guerrilleros y otras bandas armadas ilegales
3408282 se puede constatar el surgimiento de pactos y alianzas entre esos grupos con el fin de lucrarse conjuntamente del narcotr fico
3408283 situaciones absolutamente inesperadas como el hecho de que en muchas zonas son m s frecuentes los enfrentamientos entre grupos emergentes que entre stos y los grupos guerrilleros
3408284 nuevos grupos y nuevos liderazgos est n surgiendo y unos logran afianzarse y otros no pero el pr spero negocio del narcotr fico los alimenta a todos por igual
3408285 la acci n decidida de las autoridades ha permitido golpear a muchos de estos grupos y capturar o dar de baja a sus cabecillas
3408286 el terreno f rtil del narcotr fico y de otras rentas ilegales est permitiendo su reproducci n permanente en muchas zonas del pa s

3408380 in the old days people only went on the mountains when they knew what they were doing but now people are going out there on a whim

3408466 but in this economy hotels are focusing more on their current customers and with occupancy rates down 2 6 in the first half of 2008 guest staffing ratios have remained stable other factors helping to maintain or improve customer satisfaction include recent investments in customer technology facilities and new services expanded satisfaction measurement programs and pay for performance compensation and the growth of online customer reviews which help to manage guest expectations and deliver more pleasing hotel experiences

3408499 emma has been working hard and has said since the start of the year this would be her target
3408500 nicole has just achieved an amazing thing which could be distracting but on the other hand it could also have the effect of really firing her up
3408501 that was the best i ever fought and the best i ever felt
3408502 i could have fought anyone in the world that night and the tremendous backing from so many welsh fans most of them coal miners gave me great heart
3408503 i kept plugging away but credit to mccrory he took some great shots and just kept going to build up a bit of a lead
3408504 round nine was always a favourite of mine in every fight so i raised it there and caught him with some superb shots
3408505 i thought it was going to be my day but he survived and came out fighting in the 10th like a new man
3408506 i didnt know what to expect at the end but i knew that a draw was a great decision for us i knew we could come back and have a re run
3408507 it was close to midday outdoors in las vegas obviously the heat was going to affect us more
3408508 but no excuses id been out in vegas preparing for four weeks before the fight
3408509 i always liked to feel my way into a fight and to smoulder for the first few rounds
3408510 but when i was doing that in the first he clipped me with a fantastic left hook after feinting the jab and i was down
3408511 realising i was behind on points i thought that id better get flowing a bit quicker so i kicked in the seventh round instead of the ninth

3408513 i then managed an exceptional round nine and as far as i was concerned he was gone
3408514 i came out for the 10th ready to fire on all cylinders only to be astounded that hed recovered again and was able to fight as he did
3408515 it would sound like sour grapes for me to say i thought i won i didnt and thats it
3408516 id never lost any title fight id contested since the age of 11 so to hear the negative verdict for the first time was a bitter pill to swallow

3408557 patriotism in my view does not mean unquestioning acceptance of whatever the government does to go along with whatever your government does is not a characteristic of democracy i remember in my own early education we were taught that it was a sign of a totalitarian state of a dictatorship when people did not question what their government did if you live in a democratic state it means you have the right to criticize your governments policies

3408586 sarah was a delightful student and a number of staff remember her affectionately because she always had a smile on her face
3408587 but even though she was talented she was always very down to earth she always had time for people and the other children respected her as a result
3408588 as well as being in school productions she took part in a number of amateur productions in the cardiff area and members of the staff including myself used to go to see her
3408589 she really stood out for her talent and so i asked her to sing at my wedding in august 1997 she sang a song from oliver while we were signing the register and then sang at the reception as well it was lovely
3408590 we are trying to get as many votes for her as we possibly can we have been handing out flyers at parents evening and there are posters on every notice board and in reception
3408591 all the contestants are exceptionally talented but shes on a par with them shes got a fantastic singing voice
3408592 i think sarah has done exceptionally well shes a good all rounder and whatever they ask her to do she takes it on board
3408593 i spotted her talent straight away and shed only been in school a month
3408594 shes such a lovely girl and if anybody deserves to do well its her

3408596 i was away from home when the letter came through telling me id won my mum called me up crying and said im so proud of you youve won the steve kelbrick prize
3408597 i was really pleased because the competition was very high caliber and made up of some of the most outstanding people in the cadet forces
3408598 i joined the cadets when i was 15 which is quite late because most people join at the age of 13 one of my best friends at the time was an air cadet and she said join them itll be the best thing you ever do i thought ive got to try it and i did
3408599 we normally meet two nights a week but with working as a gliding instructor at weekends it can involve giving up a lot more time but i see it as something i enjoy doing so its not like its a chore it can be really rewarding
3408600 my most memorable experience is taking a young cadet flying for the first time this cadet had never flown before not even in a commercial aircraft and to see the smile on his face made all the long weekends and hours of training completely worthwhile
3408601 the people were talking to now are the people we know will vote and thats why were talking to them our main aim is to reduce the vote for the
3408602 persuading people to vote is not something i try to do i ask people if theyre going to vote and if theyre not theyre not usually interested in talking to you if they are happy to talk i will talk to them about why theyre not voting but you cant do much more
3408603 its not for us to get into an argument with them if we had more time then possibly we could try to persuade them but we dont
3408604 its unfortunate that three of the main political parties are focused on improving life for deprived communities but people most affected by economic circumstances are the least likely to vote
3408605 what were getting on the doorstep is that people are very disillusioned with labour and they are not likely to turn out to vote i fear that their negative campaigning has been aimed at stopping other voters turning out as well
3408606 its always the people at the bottom of the pile and theyre the ones who should be shouting the loudest
3408607 obviously its not good for democracy but on the other hand one has the democratic right not to vote these days politics either goes above peoples heads or they think politicians dont tell the truth
3408608 the political process is so far removed from peoples lives they find it difficult to associate themselves with it
3408609 whenever local councillors are asked to do something they say they dont have the funding from the assembly government
3408610 everybody seems to be in a line through which the buck is passed down and voters never get what they are promised you get a load of politicians getting paid and you as a voter never being satisfied
3408611 whats the point of voting if youre not going to get what you want
3408612 sometimes weve had power cuts for days at a time
3408613 i have had to shut the shop and send my customers home without charging them
3408614 its hard to quantify our losses but i would estimate weve suffered direct costs in excess of 10 000 were having to go to our insurance company just to keep our heads above water
3408615 we have had daily emails and phone calls from people who cant find us think were no longer in business or believe we have been demolished every other call my staff take they have to give someone directions
3408616 it takes a long time to build up a business and it only takes a few rumours to go around for that to be wasted
3408617 we have been in regular touch with the businesses affected because there have been around 15 power cuts in recent months all largely caused by vandalism and attempted copper thefts from our substation nearby
3408618 we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused the businesses affected and would like to reassure them we are doing everything in our power to resolve this problem
3408619 we have been in regular contact with the local business community at colchester avenue during the initial build phase of our development
3408620 new signage has been ordered and is due to be delivered in the next few weeks
3408621 furthermore the main access road works are well advanced and when finished will ensure easier access to the industrial estate and our new homes
3408622 i dont think members of the public really know what happens after seven days they assume pound dogs all get re homed but the reality is there arent enough homes in this country there are too many dogs being bred a lot of them by irresponsible breeders who are only interested in the money
3408623 wales is a well known socially deprived area and if you breed your dog you can make a lot of money the typical price for a rottweiler is 3 000 to 4 000 so if you have 10 rottweiler puppies thats a lot of money but if breeders cant sell the puppies they just dump them or ring us and ask if we can take them
3408624 we prioritise dogs by when theyre going to die thats the only way we can sometimes you might get somebody who rings up and says im going to have to put my dog to sleep tomorrow and that then becomes just as much of a priority as a pound dog
3408625 we try to get the dogs into foster or find a place at a nearby rescue centre but if we cant weve got a few people who will act as emergency fosters they cant take a dog full time but theyre prepared to foster a dog in an emergency situation
3408626 but we have to weigh up if the dog is the right sort of dog for them and if someone rings us and says im going to put my rottweiler to sleep it doesnt like children and it doesnt like other dogs the chances are were not going to be able to help that dog at that short notice
3408627 sometimes every single kennel at the pound will be full and thats also when we start looking at putting to sleep thats when it gets really tough the pounds have the ultimate choice but they will ask us which one were going to struggle most to get a place for
3408628 trying to get your conscience clear that we cant save them all and that we can only help what we can help is a hurdle you have to get over and you cant do rescue until you do when you lose a dog you cant blame yourself because youve done your best
3408629 some people think were really hard and wonder how we do it but you have to you have to shut yourself off and move onto the next dog you can help
3408630 you will cry when you lose a dog but if it consumes you so much you cant help the next dog youre not the right person to do rescue you have to very early on accept that you cant save them all and you never will be able to save them all
3408631 the problem is theres not many boarding kennels that will take on a pound contract and those that do dont tend to be the best ones some just automatically put everything to sleep after seven days thats not got a home to go to and wont even entertain working with rescues
3408632 newport is a purpose built pound and is run by the council so its very good all the staff love dogs they love what theyre doing and theyre not doing it just because its their job we do get dog wardens where its just a job to them and they dont care if the dog lives or dies
3408633 in the summer there are people who cant get their dogs into boarding who just put them out on the streets and it gets difficult for rescues like us because quite a lot of us use boarding kennels to hold our dogs in the short term and there are no kennels available in the summer
3408634 breeders tend to like to breed their dogs in the weeks leading up to christmas to get money to buy presents and when they cant sell the puppies they dump them then just following christmas all the dogs which have been bought as unwanted christmas presents get dumped as well
3408635 there are some very genuine reasons why people cannot look after their dog and most people will do the responsible thing and contact a rescue to see if they can help the irresponsible ones are those who just turn their dogs out on the streets or dump them somewhere
3408636 weve stayed true to our roots and so weve been able to build a good reputation
3408637 weve never reduced our re homing standards either and every dog from us will be neutered microchipped wormed vaccinated and fully assessed
3408638 we are going for charity status this year and the long term plan is to have our own kennels and re homing centre but we set up to be a co ordinating rescue so our heart will always be with pound dogs who have done their seven days and are waiting to move on to a rescue or foster home
3408639 fostering is really rewarding we both love dogs so its great to give a needy dog a home especially as we both work flexible hours so were not really tied at the moment
3408640 we got involved with hope when we decided to get another dog we did an internet search for a rescue place which was local and hope came up
3408641 its lovely not knowing what dog youre going to have next because we never say what breed we want as long as theyre dog friendly we can take pretty much anything as long as it gets on with our dogs
3408642 its great to stay in touch and see how the dogs get on in their new homes because you see the difference a foster home makes
3408643 we had one border collie that was nervous and it was really distressing to see her tail was always between her legs and she wouldnt even look at you she would just cower in a corner every little noise would startle her and she would run
3408644 now shes gone to a lovely home in swansea theyve got a little girl whos about eight and she meets her from school with her tail wagging its lovely to see the change in her
3408645 its nice for fosters to stay in contact with the families that adopt the dogs
3408646 ive been in contact with one of my ex fosters dudley whos just had a major operation for cruciate ligament repair he was adopted a year ago but ive been in contact with his new owner constantly and shes asked for advice about the operation and everything i am proud hope has such a good team that we can give that back up
3408647 we often find the family and friends of our foster families wanting to take on one of the dogs and thats great but we still go through the same procedure we do with each adoption
3408648 it can be hard for foster families to be objective about whether their friend or relative is the best person to take the dog and thats why we always insist an independent person goes out and home checks and then if theyre turned down its not their friend or family that has turned them down
3408649 all the dogs we re home are re homed from foster homes we will not re home from kennels because its hard to assess a dog in a kennel environment as its so artificial
3408650 as good as it gets there are lots of dogs coming to and fro and its distressing you might get a dog standing at the back of the cage showing its teeth but that might be through fear it might not actually be an aggressive dog in any way shape or form
3408651 the great thing about a foster home is you can go beyond this initial assessment
3408652 the process is the same for potential fosters and potential new owners when people approach us they have to fill in a form and if we think they sound like good candidates we ring them for a chat after that we do a home check
3408653 but apart from checking the size of the fence to make sure its secure were more looking at the people trying to assess what sort of people they are and what sort of dog would suit them best only after theyve passed the home check are they allowed to come and meet a dog
3408654 they have to bring any other pets they have in the house with them so we can see if the animals get on once the new owners have met the dog theres only been two or three times we havent then proceeded and thats usually because the dogs havent got on
3408655 we have a very high success rate with our re homing we give lifetime backup to all our dogs and will take any back that arent right for the home or dont settle but very few are returned and i think thats because we use foster homes to give them a thorough assessment
3408656 the media have demonised dogs like rottweilers by sensationalising stories about attacks with photos of them in full attack mode
3408657 if the rottweiler had been socialised with children right from a very young age it probably wouldnt have happened it was not born to attack a child but the way it was brought up and the circumstances it was placed in with that child led to the attack
3408658 it comes down to human error and a lack of socialisation and training for that particular dog and some breeds need that more than others
3408659 theres just as much chance of a yorkshire terrier biting as there is a rottweiler but obviously a rottweiler bite is a lot worse
3408660 what i find sad is not so much the dogs that come in that have been abused when they come to us theyre in a much better place its the dogs that come in that you know must belong to someone that are obviously someones pride and joy who are never going to be reunited with their owner because we have no way of tracing who they belong to
3408661 i dont know what our government does period i massachusetts legislator says hed ruin lives of child victims of rape and molestation planned parenthood bilks 180 million from california taxpayers

3408673 we are playing a very difficult non conference schedule this season but that is what you have to do to get ready for sec play
3408674 we have to be ready to play every night during the non conference part of the schedule because any one of those teams can beat on us on any given night no matter where the game is played
3408675 we have a very difficult stretch in the middle of december as we play and nc state in back to back games
3408676 those are two of the premier womens basketball programs in the country and we will have our work cut out for us in those two games
3408677 we play in the toughest conference in the country and there is never a night off in this league
3408678 many of the top teams in the country play in this league and we have to be up to the challenge every single night if we are to have a chance to compete

3409056 det siger i alle s det er ikke noget s rligt
3409057 det g r i alle s det er ikke noget s rligt
3409058 h det g r som meget godt is r efter gr sset er blevet sl et og tr erne besk ret
3409059 hvordan med den r de rose er den der endnu
3409060 det er nok det sidste vi skiller os af med
3409061 h hvor ville jeg gerne se hende igen men l gen vil ikke lukke mig ind
3409062 det er ikke kun dig hun lukker ikke nogen ind
3409063 du kan jo pr ve men s skal det v re snart jeg har lige fjernet alt hendes ukrudt og det plejer at g re hende mildere stemt
3409064 jeg plejer nu ellers at kunne holde godt fast selvom tornene stikker men vinden kan jeg ikke hamle op med jeg er havehandsken det er mig det samler ukrudtet op og ordner roserne
3409065 se f rst er der den hvide hun har altid s dan en klar tankegang hun samler p erfaring det er derfor hun er s fyldig i det s er der den gule ja hun er altid glad hun skinner som en lille sol og nsker kun at alle skal v re i godt hum r men det skal v re en gte gl de den lyser de er ogs sk n men hun er nu mere overfladisk i det altid til sjov og ballade intet tager hun n rt og dog har vi altid s dan et mas med at passe p hende den orange er mere melankolsk i det men det har ogs sin betydning den skaber nemlig kontrast endelig har vi den r de rose hun er b rer k rlighedens farve og er nok den smukkeste af dem alle hun g r egentligt ikke noget og det er heller ikke n dvendigt bare det at hun er til er nytte nok det siges at havde det ikke v ret for hende ville de andre roser ikke v re til hun er samlingspunktet og det er hende der f r det sidste ord ikke fordi hun bliver spurgt men p en eller anden m de ved de andre altid hvad hun mener
3409066 jeg vidste nok at der var andre blomster i haven det har jeg f et fortalt men ikke at de alle sammen var roser h hvor ville jeg gerne se dem
3409067 ja men s skal du f rst gennem l gen og hun lukker ikke alle og enhver ind
3409068 nej jeg har pr vet og det er h bl st
3409069 rh h bl st vil jeg nu ikke kalde det
3409070 du skal bare l re at forst l gen s bner hun sig nok
3409071 jamen hun er jo fuldkommen utiln rmelig hun er skrap og ford mmende
3409072 ja det kan man vist godt kalde os vi er begge en slags vandbeholdere
3409073 ja der skal vandes og det er jo noget som jeg kan mestre men f rst skal jeg sk ndes med l gen hun vil aldrig lade mig passere men hun overgiver sig som regel hun er n dt til at lukke mig ind hvis ikke hendes blomster skal visne hun ville jo ellers helst at regnen kunne holde dem fugtige men der vil altid v re perioder med t rke og da bliver jeg en n dvendighed
3409074 hvorfor er hun s fjendsk overfor dig n r nu du g r nytte
3409075 rh hun er s vanskelig hun tror at jeg kunne finde p at forelske mig hun mener at jeg kysser hendes dejlige blomster n r hun vender ryggen til
3409076 jeg indr mmer at der er svage jeblikke hvor jeg godt kunne elske den ene blomst men s f r jeg je p den anden og pludselig mener jeg at hun ville passe bedre til mig s dan g r det hele tiden jeg kan ikke v lge den ene fremfor den anden de er alle lige dejlige hver p sin m de
3409077 nej hvor jeg dog spilder tiden jeg m videre jeg skal ind i edens have
3409078 k re rive man siger du kender l gen fort l mig hvad der skal til for at hun bner sig
3409079 der er ikke s dan med den k rlighed jeg har ogs engang v ret forelsket det var i et skuffejern hun var smuk med lange tynde fingre og smukke negle jeg elskede alting ved hende selv hendes bedr vede jne det var en dejlig tid lige indtil hun forelskede sig i en skovl
3409080 sig mig f rst hvorfor du vil bne l gen
3409081 s er det nok derfor du ikke bliver lukket ind du er ikke v rdig
3409082 hvordan kan det v re jeg har jo lige forklaret at jeg elsker rosen hvad kan g re mig mere v rdig end det
3409083 du siger du elsker den r de rose men du elsker ikke nok
3409084 ikke nok mit hjerte er fyldt med k rlighed til hende hun er det sk nneste det mest vidunderlige der nogensinde er skabt hvordan kan det ikke v re nok
3409085 ja det er jo det du skal finde ud af og n r du g r det er hele haven din
3409086 jamen jeg vil ikke have hele haven jeg vil kun elske den r de rose
3409087 n jeg er vist bare det man kalder ulykkelig forelsket
3409088 h herre gud din stakkel s kan jeg godt forst at du er ulykkelig
3409089 det sagde riven ogs men jeg forst r ikke hvordan jeg skal kunne elske mere
3409090 du v lger en lille blomst fra den store have og den giver du alt din k rlighed men det f r jo ikke de andre til at gro ser du den r de rose er af den sort som de andre er udsprunget fra for hun er lavet af k rlighed med tiden har hver enkelt af disse roser udviklede deres egne evner
3409091 s undre det mig at du ikke har forst et det
3409092 de vokser alle i haven og i jorden har de deres r dder det ene er ikke noget v rd uden det andet men du har kun valgt den r de rose og s er du ligeglad med resten vil man have noget til at vokse m man v rne om alle de fr der er s et
3409093 hvis der er s vidunderligt inde i haven kan det ikke v re noget problem at elske dem alle
3409094 hun er jo ogs en del af have hun er bare facaden udadtil sammen med plankev rket beskytter hun s der ikke er dele af hendes have der bliver elsket mere end andre hun v rner om dem s de alle f r lov til at gro lige meget og lige st rkt
3409095 jamen hun skr mmer jo alle fra vid og sans
3409096 men tilgeng ld er hendes have i balance alting gror lige tilpas ikke for meget og heller ikke for lidt der er plads og tid til at hver enkelt lille blomst kan udfolde sig og det betyder meget hvis nu hun lukkede dig ind og du kun ville elske den r de rose hvordan skulle alt det andet s vokse du skulle flyve med mig op en dag s du kunne se helheden
3409097 du forventer at l gen skal bne sig n r det i virkeligheden er dig der skal lukke op
3409098 du m have meget gemt i dig som du ikke t r s tte fri
3409099 nu m jeg til at lette inden uvejret bryder l s

3409164 with a lot of guys down weve got to take a lot of reps
3409165 you dont get many one on ones so our receivers end up going against no defender
3409166 its a situation weve been in now for a while it is what it is
3409167 we dont worry too much about it because weve got to figure out our team
3409168 to hold a guy back and try to save him so someone else doesnt see him were a long ways from getting to that position our rosters not deep enough to worry about that weve got to find who can play for us
3409169 ken donahue was one of the most enthusiastic hard working coaches weve ever had around here
3409170 he played that same way football was his life he was a real student of the game and even after he retired he was a regular at local high school contests bear bryant said he was the best assistant coach he ever had
3409171 this is the best thing theyve done as far as the schedule
3409172 youre just not crammed i cant believe we used to do it the way we did it it was so hard on them physically
3409173 certainly the process is one that weve been through a number of times sometimes even up through the week of the game it is what it is from that standpoint

3409223 one of the great strengths of this campaign from the very beginning has been the cohesion the sense of camaraderie and the lack of drama
3409224 wir d rfen uns keinen kompetenzverlust in der kernforschung leisten solange um uns herum berall neue kernkraftwerke gebaut werden
3409225 the closer you look the more clearly you see that denial is part of the uneasy bargain we strike to be social creatures
3409226 we really do want to be moral people but the fact is that we cut corners to get individual advantage and we rely on the room that denial gives us to get by to wiggle out of speeding tickets and to forgive others for doing the same
3409227 if you are guilty of an integrity based violation and you apologize that hurts you more than if you are dishonest and deny it
3409228 what we concluded is that good people can be dishonest up to the level where conscience kicks in
3409229 that essentially you can fool the conscience a little bit and make small transgressions without waking it up it all goes under the radar because you are not paying that much attention
3409230 money is important in life it does not give you happiness we all know but it sure calms the nerves
3409231 the degree to which commercial entities will go to disrupt a humanitarian project
3409232 this was a project that could operate outside the regular business world
3409233 and thats not an unreasonable expectation but it is in some ways threatening to businesses and when you threaten businesses especially very large ones they are going to react in ways that hurt you
3409234 he said that sort of thing privately to people i knew
3409235 there was a fair amount of that i was annoyed enough to say so and he apologised for it a lot of good that did
3409236 was not the how of computing but the why and the primary answer was learning
3409237 this was a very remote village no electricity no telephone no tv but the wi fi was so well done that when i asked myself if you look at the constituent parts they were all replicable and in most cases the prices would scale down the one exception was the laptop that became the focus
3409238 its crippling because like an suv most of the power in that machine is being used to drive the machine not you or i
3409239 its not working as well as it should because not enough people are connected at the moment
3409240 it was like you get married and then your girlfriend comes back
3409241 that intel viewed it quite as holistically as we did
3409242 but we came this close to not doing it i was advised by absolutely everybody to make it a profit making entity so we could make lots of money and then give it away but the non profit decision was important because it provided clarity of purpose first a head of state will talk to you because its about children and learning and not profit and secondly the best people will work for you for zero salary
3409243 he would go from prime minister meeting to president of country meeting and that was his sales model
3409244 and it didnt work absolutely not as we have learnt in the business world just because you have a handshake from the president or the prime minister it doesnt mean you have an order
3409245 it created enough hype and pictures of nicholas shaking hands with heads of state that back in taiwan where 250 engineers were working on it people felt part of something
3409246 it can take years to get a ui right so starting from scratch for me was a question
3409247 i left because the future of sugar was going to be bigger and bolder than just being confined to the olpc laptop
3409248 its hard to pinpoint a start date with the nature of ethnographic research in which ethnographers collect data over a long period of time
3409249 which is chartered to extend pc access to the worlds next billion users
3409250 that they waited until very late in the day to make it nearly impossible for olpc representatives on the east coast to get their side of the story in the first stories
3409251 if nicholas hadnt said what he said in january 05
3409252 this machine wouldnt be here and a lot of other technologies and discussions wouldnt be here he accelerated people getting access by probably years
3409253 they could keep on coming up with innovations and license out the technology take the money and fund olpc or they could open source the entire design of the computer

3409262 and even though those who made this flag and symbol of the state of israel were bad people in any case they did not consider it the flag a c to be a holy item which if they had done so would have led to suspect that it is like idolatry but it is like every secular object and if it was possible to dismiss the entire matter of the flag without causing an argument so there will not be any memory of the actions of the bad people this would be the correct thing to do but heaven forbid causing an argument about this
3409263 our argument and war against the zionist sate is not because it is not religious enough rather we disagree with the very essence of its establishment even if it was ultra religious
3409264 and even if all the members of the government were beloved all of them pure even like the mishnaic and talmudic sages in any case they have taken the rule and the freedom into their own hands before the time has arrived this is considered
3409265 i made you swear daughters of jerusalem that you shall not awaken my desire before its time
3409266 that they will not subject oppress the jewish people too much

3409275 we needed good football players we needed good students but more than anything else we wanted to bring in a group of kids that will be pretty apt to put themselves second and put the team first
3409276 what i saw of riley this past spring was a much more mature quarterback a guy that is pretty focused on taking care of the football making first downs not feeling like hes got to be some gun slinger guy who throws 50 60 balls a game
3409277 i think overall our talent level at receiver is as good as its been since ive been at wake forest but a lot of the guys are young and i dont know how theyre going to respond when they get in competition
3409278 with coach grobe its either be disciplined or dont play you can be the best athlete in the world but if you dont know where youre supposed to be or how to get there you just wont play
3409279 its not about talent its about teamwork everyone being in tune we hold each other accountable if you dont know what youre doing you cant play thats one reason everybody redshirts
3409280 wed like it to be the wrigley field of the acc where we can put 32 to 35 thousand fans in there hopefully it can be one of the most fan friendly places to come and watch a football game

3409338 hank was inspired by years of frustration and rejection as an artist trying to break into an industry that frowned on edgy bands
3409339 opposition to keeping u s troops as an occupying force on muslim soil in iraq his criticism of the united nations and insistence on having the u s out of the u n and his refusal to sign a pledge of support for john mccain the presumptive nominee for president
3409340 they are a sovereign nation we have given them their sovereignty
3409341 the appropriate overwhelming and vicious response to any terrorist attack against the united states
3409342 i support hunting down osama bin laden and eliminating him
3409343 i will not support occupation for the sake of nation building
3409344 occupation is the single greatest recruiter and motivator in the jihadists cause while we occupy holy muslim land we will always have a highly motivated patient terrorist threat
3409345 our very presence on holy muslim soil fuels the fire of jihad against the united states and unites our enemies against us we can and should pursue terrorists with the intent of retribution but should not occupy muslim lands
3409346 furthermore if we pay attention to the declaration of war against us by al qaeda we will notice that they fight us because of our continued support for regimes that oppress muslims we must stop giving taxpayer money in the form of aid and support to oppressive regimes
3409347 they come to annihilate what is left of this people and to humiliate their muslim neighbors third if the americans aims behind these wars are religious and economic the aim is also to serve the jews petty state and divert attention from its occupation of jerusalem and murder of muslims there the best proof of this is their eagerness to destroy iraq the strongest neighboring arab state and their endeavor to fragment all the states of the region such as iraq saudi arabia egypt and sudan into paper statelets and through their disunion and weakness to guarantee israels survival and the continuation of the brutal crusade occupation of the peninsula
3409348 all these crimes and sins committed by the americans are a clear declaration of war on god his messenger and muslims
3409349 we must stop giving taxpayer money in the form of aid and support to oppressive regimes
3409350 if need be returning to al qaedas fatwa at the very beginning we read

3409359 we denounce this heartless act and i offer our condolences and sympathies to the families of those killed and injured
3409360 this attackers target might have been isaf soldiers but he only succeeded in proving the insurgents utter disregard for the lives of the afghan people

3409436 getting a tour card is probably worth more than two million bucks piercy said sunday evening as he basked in the glow of his triumph
3409437 sitting that long was not much fun said piercy who attempted and failed to monday qualify into prior events on the schedule with the outcome leaving him feeling as empty as a beggars pocket
3409438 i didnt realize how tough it would be i kept missing by one or two shots when you got right down to my situation it was almost like having no status at all
3409439 i could feel this coming he said of his victory with a tournament record total of 22 under par
3409440 if i drove it well i didnt putt well he said
3409441 if i putted well i didnt drive it well the hardest part was putting it all together
3409442 and only one of those is good he said laughing
3409443 but ive learned a lot and grown as a player and a person

3409449 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3409450 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3409451 these are the kinds of things you see in e mails that you see circulating about obama in this sort of subterranean smear campaign against him you never see these things voiced by the candidates
3409452 had sen clinton followed mark penns advice it would have caused her more angst than good
3409453 whats going on right now is that a lot of obama supporters and fundraisers are trying very hard to retire sen clintons debt one reason theyve had difficulty doing so is the dislike among obama people for mark penn specifically
3409454 they tend to blame him for the nature of these negative attacks
3409455 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3409456 this was a historic campaign people thought it would be an easy march to the nomination and then an easy win in the fall and instead weve had this historic presidential election where shes collapsed and a first term senator has won the democratic nomination
3409457 so i think its just the nature of the defeat has made a lot of people frustrated and theres certainly people out there who really want the kind of full story to come to light so people can understand exactly what happened
3409458 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3409459 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3409460 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right

3409466 i think obviously india owes an obligation to speed up the legal and judicial process so that the child is able to travel as soon as possible
3409467 i am very worried and stressed why cant they let her father take his child
3409468 i think this should end there should be stricter laws

3409480 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3409481 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3409511 thousands put their faith and confidence in him and he has let them down
3409512 that kid hasnt ever seen a klim in a hurry that i can tell ya right now
3409513 the first evening she had sat down on her doorstep and grandmother who must have been very unlike herself in her youth how curious that a fillyjonk with a true sense of natures beauty should have wanted to live on this glum and sandy shore not the smallest leafy tree or even bush to start an arbour with not even a nice view and afterwards of course the fillyjonk had found out that it was all a mistake she had moved into this horrible house on this horrible beach quite unnecessarily her grandmother had lived elsewhere that is life
3409514 once upon a time there was a fillyjonk who washed her large carpet in the sea she rubbet it with soap and a brush up to the first blue stripe and then she waited for a seventh wave to come and wash the soap away then she soaped and rubbed further to the next blue stripe and the sun was warming her back and she stood with her thin legs in the clear water rubbing and rubbing ot was a mild an motionless summer day exactly right for washing carpets slow and sleepy swells came rolling in to help her with the rinsing and around her red cap a few bumple bees were humming ther took her for a flower dont you pretend the fillyjonk though grimly i know how things are everythings always peaceful like this just before a disaster
3409515 the cakes are my grandmas recipy said the fillyjonk and then she leaned forward over the table and whispered this calm is unnatural it means something terrible is going to happen dear gaffsie believe me we are so very small and insignificant and so are our tea cakes and carpets and all those things you know and still theyre so important but always theyre threatened by mercilessness oh said gaffsie feeling ill at ease yes by mercilessness the fillyjonk continued rather breathlessly by something one cant ask anything of nor argue with nor understand and that never telss one anything something that one can see drawing near throug a black window pane far away on the road far away to sea growing and growing but not really showing itself until too late mrs gaffsie have you felt it tell that you know what im talking about please gaffsie was very red in the face and sat twirling the sugar bowl in her paws and wishing that she had never come there can be very sudden storms at this time of the year she said at last cautiously
3409516 she got hold of a china kitten and pressed it hard in her paw then a window blew open and shattered its pane in small fragments over her floor with a sickening crash her great chandelier fell to the floor it had belong to her maternal uncle all around her the fillyjonk heard her belongings cry and creak then she caught a flash of her own pale snout in a fragment of a mirror and without any further thought she rushed up to the window and jumped out ive never been out alone at night before the fillyjonk thought if mother knew she started to crawl against the wind down to the beach to get as far away as possible from the hemulens house she still held the china kitten in her left paw it calmed her to have something to protect and the strange thing was that she suddenly felt quite safe it was a very strange feeling and she found it indesribably nice but what was there to worry about the disaster had come at last
3409517 wayne will probably miss the start of the season and louis sahas future is undecided at the moment its left us a little short up front
3409518 this government is simply not going to throw in the towel when the health and safety of our communities and the lives of our young people are at risk
3409519 we remain committed to the goals of making our communities safer protecting our youth from a life of drugs and crime and showing compassion for those who fall victim to illicit drugs
3409520 i am proud to be part of a government that is working to reduce the damaging effects of illicit drugs on our youth and on our communities
3409521 our collaboration with the provinces territories and support agencies help provide youth the support they need to make smart choices and steer clear of illicit drugs and drug related crime
3409522 we cannot build safer communities without addressing the needs of young people with addiction issues
3409523 this initiative is part of a broader provincial strategy to treat youth with substance abuse problems by treating addiction we believe we can reduce reoffending and stop the progress of youth offenders into the adult justice system we appreciate the federal governments continued support as we work together to reduce youth addiction and crime
3409524 they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
3409525 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance

3409641 consider that the healthiest foods in the supermarket the fresh produce are the ones that dont make fda approved health claims which typically festoon the packages of the most highly processed foods
3409642 the food label can be a consumers best shopping tool
3409643 you can compare nutrients and ingredients between similar products determine which nutrients the food contributes to your total diet safe preparation methods and much more
3409644 avoid portion distortion a muffin that you make at home would have 210 calories but the size you get in a bakery is 500 plus calories
3409645 i love creating characters animating them and giving them a life of their own
3409646 ive always wanted to create a set of vinyl toys i hope that one day both my toys and my art can be spread across the world inspiring people and bringing joy into their lives
3409647 the theme was requiem which was a little tough for me since my style usually revolves around colorful cute and annoying characters but i gave it a shot anyway so i created a piece that is somewhat dark and negative but still maintaining the style of cuteness in fly away above the candycanes life came to an end started decaying and rotting and then eventually got holes in them their spirits flew out and carried whats left in them the peppermint bits ready to move on to the next life

3409656 the atmosphere in the stadium was incredible and it was a great feeling to play in front of them
3409657 the team is very strong now and we need to keep our form up against middlesbrough next weekend and make the best possible start to the season
3409658 the fans at the lane are like an extra man for the team which is very important for us
3409659 as with my time at psv i play my football with the fans and for the fans and the atmosphere in the stadium was great
3409660 if were going to try and compete even at premier league level let alone europe we need a decent squad so we need to keep adding quality if we can
3409661 weve lost freddie bouma and we were quite thin on the ground before that that sort of injury can happen at any given minute therefore we need to try and safeguard as much as we can
3409662 what weve done is bring in a recognised right back and a recognised left back to help us we didnt have the right back last year but it wasnt for lack of trying
3409663 weve not finished well still have some players coming in to give us a chance and if were lucky enough to qualify for the group stages of the uefa cup that would take us right up to christmas and well most definitely need the squad
3409664 there continues to be reluctance on the part of both patients and treating physicians to accept the toxicity of platinum based therapy given the associated small gain in survival so active therapies with improved toxicity profiles are clearly needed
3409665 this is a promising alternative but needs further testing in randomized trials
3409666 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3409667 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3409668 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3409669 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future
3409670 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3409671 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3409672 we want families to provide their child with an environment in which they not only learn how to eat healthy but have the opportunity to practice what they learn
3409673 and by partnering with parents as teachers we now can disseminate this program to their sites nationwide this further impacts healthy eating patterns in parents and their preschool children
3409674 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3409675 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3409676 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells
3409677 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes
3409678 there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved
3409679 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward

3409685 if all these cops and agents couldnt get this one corner clean whats the point of this whole damned drug war
3409686 that not only did they not fear our war on drugs they actually counted on it on one undercover tape recorded conversation a top cartel chief jorge roman expressed his gratitude for the drug war calling it a sham put on the american tax payer that was actually good for business
3409687 yeah we know the police and military battles against drug gangs dont work but we sold the plan up and down the potomac
3409688 the hugely expensive antidrug campaigns we are waging around the world are basically futile
3409689 even as i write these words it is virtually certain that somewhere on the streets of washington d c an eighteen year old white kid from the maryland or north virginia suburbs is buying a stash of drugs from an eighteen year old black kid the white kid is going to take that stash back to the suburbs and make some quick money by selling it to other kids
3409690 look back on his drug use just as recreational and joke about it just one more little rebellion on the way to adulthood
3409691 will enter a hell from which he may never recover
3409692 prison life will change the black kid harden him mess up his mind and redefine his self image and after he is released from prison the black kid will be dragging an invisible ball and chain behind him for the rest of his life by the time the white kid reaches fifty years of age he may well be a judge by the time the black kid reaches fifty he will likely be permanently unemployable will be ineligible for many government assistance programmes and will not even be able to vote
3409693 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3409694 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did

3409698 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3409699 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3409700 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3409701 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3409702 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3409703 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3409704 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3409705 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3409715 my car was probably the fastest car out there for two laps
3409716 after that it was one of the slowest cars we know it and weve got to work on it hopefully next year well get an opportunity to come here or go to sonoma and test at those tracks because weve lost that magic that we had at one time
3409717 we didnt have the cautions to work on it early enough here and it bit us
3409718 its not any one persons fault were all in it together we have some work to do
3409719 we had a real average car and we had a real above average strategy and pit crew so those guys got me the good finish really were heading into a stretch of tracks that i really enjoy racing at so hopefully well be able to make up some ground there
3409720 we have our work cut out for us for the next four races but i know this team can make it happen
3409721 weve been saying youre missing a great opportunity to get more of your people in here to celebrate your games
3409722 i would want to stress how important it is for the host city that the venues are seen to be full and everybody has the opportunity to enjoy the festivities
3409723 we have taken this up with organizers and the politicians
3409724 they have promised an improvement today and further improvement tomorrow we hope this is going to take place we need more people to have a higher atmosphere
3409725 when i went out there was a small trickle of people walking through
3409726 access is difficult and security is incredibly tight at some venues its surprising when there have been sellouts and you see quite a few empty seats at the stadiums you need warm enthusiastic crowds to help create an atmosphere for athletes to perform at their best
3409727 i just went to volleyball and it was absolutely rocking
3409728 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find too many empty seats they will organize some cheerleaders who are volunteers

3409731 we did some follow up investigation our ultimate conclusion was that we think that there are additional facts that corroborate her description of what occurred and not his
3409732 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
3409733 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward
3409734 oh great another game being turned into a movie like doom and laura croft was not enough get outta here shawn

3409745 just as uk plc is bracing itself for the financial impact of post graduates that expect the latest and greatest gadgets and mobile access technologies so should universities
3409746 universities that want to lure the best students will need to invest heavily to implement an it infrastructure that will meet the expectations of this group and maintain their competitive edge in the race for securing higher student intake to meet this 150m price tag it is inevitable that universities will be looking to the government uk plc and possibly students to put their hands in their pockets
3409747 this survey is deliberately targeted at an age group that is being asked to choose its education and career path whilst this science statistic should worry uk plc and the governments of today and tomorrow the message is clear if we can educate them on the correlation between science and the gadgets they cant live without and spark their interest before choosing their gcse options we can influence the future of british industry
3409748 educators and private industry need to collaborate closely on how sciences are taught businesses worldwide are increasingly dependent upon technology to create new markets and achieve better margins technology is a lucrative thriving career option that seeks to drive down operational costs and increase innovation in a climate whereby the future careers of the realtime generation could be impacted by the credit crunch this is an opportune moment for the science and technology industry to reach out to this digital native workforce

3409751 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3409752 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks

3409769 good email delivered to the inbox is welcomed but people hate spam and are equally frustrated when valid email is unnecessarily blocked however the picture has improved significantly in recent years today all the parties involved in email marketing recognise that they have to collaborate if the industry is to combat spam and ensure that the medium achieves its potential
3409770 a growing spirit of openness has seen isps become richer sources of information which in turn enables email marketers to respond by using the sophisticated capabilities of lyris listmanager 10 everyone wins because less spam is delivered and more legitimate messages get in to the inbox

3409772 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3409773 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer

3409789 the hd 4850 is the card that has put amd ati back on the graphics card map over the past month while the hd 3850 and hd 3870 were both good cards a constant line up of nvidia cards along with price drops meant that the aging technology was having trouble keeping up with cards not only in a similar price bracket but cheaper again the latest hd 4850 to come into the labs is from gigabyte and before we get stuck into the performance side of things we will have a look at the package and whats inside as well as the card itself so lets not ramble on anymore and just get stuck into it

3409791 in the past weve always specd a high end air cooler for our performance build however weve seen a few really good yet inexpensive liquid cooling kits come out recently among these was the swiftech h20 220 compact that we reviewed several months ago coming from a brand like swiftech you know its going to be high quality and the performance is really good even for a pre assembled kit if you dont have room for a double sized radiator in your case the swiftech compact series is also available in a single h20 120 model
3409792 the msi r4850 what is there to say about this video card except that it rocked the msi r4850 was not only able to overclock higher than the sapphire hd4850 that i recently tested but the msi card was also able to stay cooler under a full load than the sapphire by about 20 c i was very surprised when i saw that this card was competitively priced with the other hd4850 cards that have the stock cooling solution which adds an extra value to the card the performance of the r4850 surpassed the sapphire hd4850 not by much however in the benchmark world every point makes a difference and adds even more value to the card

3409794 the zalman zm750 hp power supply passed testing and all my methods to melt it down its rated to 750 watts and doesnt come up short in any power rail if four 12v rails offering 20 amps each isnt enough then consider zalmans 850 or 1000 watt heat pipe models most users are going to find this psu far more capable for their sli based systems and endless drive arrays its a silent clear winner from a name trusted by enthusiasts the world over you can rest easy that the zalman 750 watt heat pipe power supply can fulfill its purpose
3409795 i love to know what magic its engineers infused into the biostar tpower i45 motherboard to make it an overclocking monster but reaching 600mhz fsb with this board is a real possibility on first glance the biostar tpower i45 motherboard has the appearence of a standard mid range enthusiast friendly platform but its not until you start overclocking that its true potential becomes apparent as well see later in the review the tpower i45 is based on intels new and very popular p45 express and ich10r chipsets

3409800 while we concentrate on this sector the focus is now moving towards the lower end of the spectrum via has really cornered this market in the past when it came to ultra compact pcs epia has been vias biggest success and with the evolution of the via processors each generation has gotten just that little bit more capable now intel has seen just how popular this is we finally have some competition in this sector today we will be pitting the atom platform against the nano platform who has the best performance and energy savings well we dont know yet but by the end of this we will have an informative answer to that lets move on and check out the platforms individually before we get into the testing phase

3409803 its hard to turn around and say that the hd 4870 x2 is one of the most anticipated cards of recent times due to the plain fact that there have been so many cards released over the last three months while some had thought that the new hd 4870 would become the fastest single card solution on the market the price amd launched the card at gave indication that the chances were going to be pretty slim fast forward a few months and weve got a new card that sits at around the same price of the gtx 280 its packing two hd 4870 cores on a single pcb the same core speed and memory speed as its single card brethren and hopefully a whole bunch of extra performance
3409804 ati launches their high end single vga card today the hd4870x2 is compared to nvidia top offering in this review using 8 different games to see which ones comes out on top read on to find out

3409888 i think emotionally it probably did take a little bit out of me but ive been very careful about what ive been doing and reacting to that
3409889 just play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead thats why i was trying to hold back a little bit so i didnt blow my tank and i can swim fast tomorrow morning

3409940 this rfid guideline is an important step in developing a comprehensive look at rfid tag quality
3409941 the reg members involved in this work are to be commended for developing guidelines and test procedures that can be used industry wide
3409942 tag quality is important for all industries and applications the use of rfid with tires presents extreme challenges for both design and manufacturing quality including rfid into tire manufacturing requires surviving conditions of high heat and pressure in everyday use tires flex constantly and are subjected to extremes of heat and cold whats more tires contain carbon which can affect rf signals significantly
3409943 these guidelines will help the tire industry evaluate or develop rfid tags particularly those operating in the uhf range that can perform reliably under a wide range of conditions
3409944 the use of rfid for tires will help address the increasing demand to be able to identify and track tires for various applications even for the life of the tire additionally the ability to identify individual tires on large commercial vehicles helps operators maintain these tires and provides additional safety for equipment operators and the general public

3409953 we made the decision to expand our customer base following the gradual lifting of the red tape that has previously prohibited us from competing for commercial projects
3409954 however to operate effectively in this commercial fashion requires a high level of productivity and reliability especially when you consider that the natural extension of shared services could be that we eventually find ourselves supplying print to members of the local private sector too so we needed to ensure we had equipment to support our aspirations the addition of the pf p330 and other recent purchases means we are in a great position to a help us exploit these new market opportunities open to us and gives us the confidence to know we can complete on a level playing field in terms of technology speed and efficiency
3409955 stock comes off our digital presses with a lot of static which complicates folding to help us address this total pfs visited us with a number of demo machines so we could test each one under actual working conditions it was the pf p330 which shone under these conditions we now print around 100 000 colour copies per month and 20 to 25 percent of that is finished on the pf p330 it copes exceptionally well with the static and im sure it could deal with any increase in volume
3409956 the pf p330 is incredibly user friendly and reliable its small footprint also makes it ideal for a production environment like north somerset district council which like many across the industry has moved away from inhouse litho production in recent years towards a digital print on demand operation features such as the automatic setting of fold plates have reduced previously time consuming operations down to the touch of a button which is a major advantage when producing short production quick turnaround jobs
3409957 weve dealt with total pfs many times in the past and have always been impressed with the level of knowledge and service provided by the team were very pleased with our new folding machine and the consultative approach that was taken by total to ensure we had the right machine for the job when you are running such a time critical business its important to know you have a supplier you can rely on to support you when you need it

3409995 its vital for us that we create extra capacity in diecutting so that we can maintain our service levels to customers that extra capacity has to be versatile and also has to deliver a high quality of product which is why we chose bobst
3409996 we wanted a bobst machine all along because of the legendary quality of its diecutting and its ability to get jobs through that other diecutters cant we could have bought a second hand machine but that way you are just buying other peoples problems so we kept with our policy of buying new
