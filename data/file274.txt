2740000 yeah sweet cash bonus only pushing it back an extra week
2740001 instead of this so called civil rights bill for example that says you have to give preferences to minorities i think the american people are going once they see the obamanation theyre going to demand a tweaking of that and say you have to put the majority into office
2740002 large numbers of these people really seem to think that an obama election would benefit them hugely
2740003 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2740004 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2740005 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2740006 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2740007 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
2740008 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
2740009 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2740010 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2740011 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2740012 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2740013 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president

2740023 if i eat mexican food i have to dose 15 20 units for some reason its gotten worse over the years and i need to dose higher and higher
2740024 chinese food is the absolute worst i dose 20 25 units before eating chinese ill often have to dose more afterwards because my blood sugar goes so berserk

2740026 i am still in iraq i hear nothing from your government yet
2740027 our pesticide is deemed safe by the usda because it contains no pcbs
2740028 food companies just like companies that sell cigarettes pharmaceuticals or any other commodity routinely place the needs of stock holders over considerations of public health food companies will make and market any product that sells regardless of its nutritional value or its effect on health in this regard food companies hardly differ from cigarette companies they lobby congress to eliminate regulations perceived as unfavorable they press federal regulatory agencies not to enforce such regulations and when they dont like regulatory decisions they file lawsuits like cigarette companies food companies co opt food and nutrition experts by supporting professional organizations and research and they expand sales by marketing directly to children members of minority groups and people in develop countries whether or not the products are likely to improve peoples diets
2740029 my friends and neighbors have all had bypass operations sooner or later i guess its going to be my turn

2740032 imaging has at least 3 virtues it individualizes risk assessment beyond use of age which is a less reliable surrogate for atherosclerosis burden it provides an integrated assessment of the lifetime exposure to risk factors and it identifies individuals who are susceptible to developing atherosclerosis beyond established risk factors also of importance in the absence of detectable atherosclerosis short term risk appears to be very low

2740036 you will call me my husband instead of my master
2740037 i will answer the pleading of the sky for clouds which will pour down water on the earth in answer to its cries for rain
2740038 at that time i will plant a crop of israelites and raise them for myself

2740040 there is no faithfulness no kindness no knowledge of god in your land
2740041 i cant accept the viscera report since it does not say who attacked ishmeet and drowned him in the swimming pool how can anyone believe he could sink in a pool no more than six feet deep
2740042 we have mobilised all forces including the military and police to overcome the effects of the floods
2740043 we are trying to get to the flood victims bury the dead and provide medical treatment to the injured
2740044 telecommunications cables have been cut in some areas it takes half a day to walk from the local commune headquarters to the places where victims are stranded
2740045 i think the number of dead may increase because there are so many people missing feared dead
2740046 one of the most beautiful verses in all scripture having to do with preparation is the lords loving promise to his apostles on the eve of his crucifixion

2740051 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2740052 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2740053 i enjoy our conversations our relationship is constructive and its important and also very candid
2740054 he told president hu that this is an important aspect of the u s china dialogue and that the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect of our dialogue
2740055 president hu seemed to indicate that the door is open to religious freedom in china and that in the future there will be more room for religious believers
2740056 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2740057 i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding the american flag that was pretty cool

2740069 as of today most of the city tskhinvali is controlled by russian peacekeeping forces
2740070 military commanders have made their decision to pull back from tskhinvali this morning
2740071 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2740072 it is my dearest hope that military action will stop immediately and that they will abstain in the name of their common christian inheritance from further clashes and violence
2740073 the georgian tanks fired at everything they saw including women and children
2740074 its so difficult to be here and know my husband is still in south ossetia every moment i fear the worst will happen she said
2740075 what we dont understand is the way some of them are treated some of them are not criminals
2740076 some of them are being stopped sometimes just because the way they look
2740077 i see a new character above all after the riots on may 1 in hamburg
2740078 the black block of neo nazis are attacking left wingers and police officers with an aggression that can be seen as a change in strategy
2740079 before neo nazis largely avoided violence for tactical reasons but this no longer appears to be the case
2740080 i see a new character above all after the riots on may 1 in hamburg
2740081 if you approach a pedestrian crossing and you dont know whether there are any pedestrians nearby you must drive slowly so the car can come to an immediate stop if needed
2740082 we are aware of this matter and necessary measures have been taken against them
2740083 we have clear guidelines for all employees in funcom not least those who work with customer service and if the guidelines are broken leads to the consequences
2740084 after all it is our heritage that shapes our future
2740085 weve been trying for the last two years to do something with them they seem to think this history belongs to them
2740086 this is our towns history it shouldnt go to the highest bidder
2740087 this is the kind of simple non compliance that has frustrated citizens here for a long time

2740090 in one quarter or more of patients with influenza a h5n1 virus infection the source of exposure is unclear and environment to human transmission remains possible
2740091 it is unknown whether influenza a h5n1 virus infection can begin in the human gastrointestinal tract
2740092 in several patients diarrheal disease preceded respiratory symptoms and virus has been detected in feces
2740093 drinking potable water and eating properly cooked foods are not considered to be risk factors but ingestion of virus contaminated products or swimming or bathing in virus contaminated water might pose a risk
2740094 the sense from the candidates was that science wasnt an issue that would move voters
2740095 vital that we restore the role of objective science in policymaking
2740096 in the past month ive been in so much pain and i havent been able to practise for 10 days
2740097 i havent even hit a ball since arriving in beijing
2740098 we knew the night time swims could bring that out of us and we went out hard but i didnt even think we were on the world record pace

2740103 han sido incontables las voces en estos dos meses solicitando que se pare esta locura porque no solo no resuelve ninguno de los problemas de fondo sino que al contrario los profundiza no amerita su costo desde ning n punto de vista y probablemente el d a siguiente ser m s complicado para el presidente y para el pa s en general

2740110 the strategy in the war on terrorism must be changed the world must focus on terrorist bases hideouts and training camps
2740111 afghanistan has repeatedly and constantly informed its allies about this about what our neighbouring countrys intelligence has been doing in afghanistan
2740112 its still not too late if the international community focuses on the terrorists bases hideouts and places where they are being trained and financed the problem is going to solved
2740113 therefore the use of air force in the war against terrorism in the afghan villages will have no result but causing civilian casualties
2740114 i thought i was going to die it was unbelievable the house shifted the front door its a solid wooden door its in pieces

2740116 our goal is to create a situation where should steve decide to run there will be a grass roots and finance organization already in place to secure him the republican nomination
2740117 steve lonegans conservative leadership is the reason he is the republican party s premier leader when so many other leaders have been asleep at the wheel
2740118 no one in new jersey has the record of accomplishment steve lonegan has built from stopping mcgreeveys gasoline tax hike to defeating two ballot questions last november and the corzine borrowing and toll hike scheme last spring
2740119 steve lonegans fight against state debt is legendary and his leadership in taking on the corzine 3 9 billion bond boondoggle and the new corzine coah low income housing regulations are just more reasons why he is the man for the job
2740120 as mayor he virtually froze municipal spending and debt during his twelve years in office and kept municipal taxes far below the inflation rate
2740121 in the time steve froze municipal spending the states budget literally doubled
2740122 new jersey republicans continue to lose election after election because we run the same old gang of weak kneed wimpy moderates who believe in nothing and are afraid to throw a punch
2740123 steve lonegan is the antithesis of the losing republican he knows how to play the game neither the democrats nor corzines money intimidates him to steve defeat is not an option and that resonates with the millions of overtaxed new jersey voters ready to give up on our state but ready to give our state one more chance
2740124 our officers arrived on scene and sadly came across a body of a 16 year old youth who was taken quickly to hospital but who was unfortunately pronounced deceased at the hospital
2740125 freedom and democracy to the darkest corners of the world
2740126 a striking advantage as commander in chief albeit perhaps not surprising given his military background
2740127 seventy two percent of americans even most democrats say hed be a good commander in chief of the military by contrast fewer than half 48 percent say obama would be a good commander in chief
2740128 john mccains life experience has earned him a solid national reputation as someone who can serve as the nations commander in chief with 80 saying he can handle the responsibilities of this important role barack obama
2740129 lags well behind on the same measure but does pass the 50 public confidence threshold
2740130 the game was hard for us australia placed a lot of players in midfield which gave us a lot of difficulties
2740131 the game did not proceed as we expected but we have six points and we have reached the quarter finals although we still need to work harder
2740132 the very mental horoscope is probably the least loyal by nature and where the synthesis also shows much mutability we get something of a time server and turncoat
2740133 we are all in the same boat in a stormy sea and we owe each other a terrible loyalty

2740136 the major changes in architecture in this build may introduce a couple of new crash causing bugs and that is one of the reasons why we want to test the build before releasing it to everyone

2740145 mccain leads the money race with nearly every other top giver in the oil and gas industry though koch industries valero marathon oil occidental petroleum conocophillips
2740146 mccain also has a big edge with hess corp 91 000 to obamas 8 000 which has gotten some attention and overall mccains campaign has gotten three times more money from the industry than obamas has 1 3 million compared to about 394 000

2740151 he contributes an enormous amount to the sport and we are indebted to him for his support for the new zealand skiing masters this year
2740152 we have also had outstanding support from our sponsors including browns ski shop merrell head and volkl skis rockburn wines and sacred hill wines
2740153 its great being part of an event like this and i love the camaraderie
2740154 the friendly rivalry in all the age groups both on and off the course is a hallmark of masters skiing and the social program is just as important as the racing schedule
2740155 competition for the danny reid memorial trophy is always intense
2740156 many people enter the masters at coronet peak because there is nowhere else they can get the chance to race a downhill the course runs from the top of the mountain to the bottom and racing in the early morning as the sun comes up is an incredible experience
2740157 this is such a cool fun thing to be in a coffee shop with your friends and it hit me that maybe we could start up a coffee company we researched if it was viable and it turned out that you can make a lot of money in coffee so that was our catalyst

2740192 this is about where the polls were a month ago durbin d ill said in an appearance on
2740193 you and i live and breathe politics but most americans have a life to lead theyre really not going to focus on it until we get close to the election americans want change they know john mccain is more of the same
2740194 i think bill clinton is hurting ill be honest with you said durbin pointing to the tough race that the former presidents wife lost for the democratic presidential nomination
2740195 but trust me when people judge what bill clinton did in moving our economy forward hes going to do quite well and he will campaign for obama
2740196 there is weakness when it comes to both political parties said durbin noting that edwards has announced through a spokesman that he will not be attending the party convention in denver this month
2740197 the amount of money they are taking in profits at the expense of families and farmers and the business of our overall economy the profit taking that they are experiencing is at the expense of this economy

2740437 people tend to think about the pixies as this real popular group but back then we werent that well known in marketing terms nirvana was the band that broke alternative music that was when in 91 or 92 the pixies last tour was in may 1992 we missed that kind of push i think that only after where is my mind got on the soundtrack to the fight club in 1999 was when the pixies resurgence started

2740439 you know in many ways your mother was the best thing to happen to steve she was the perfect choice as a wife both professionally and industrially for him
2740440 but she wasnt a good choice socially because you see your mother was a very anti social woman
2740441 perhaps she would have been more inclined to be social had she considered the people of her acquaintance worth socialising with

2740454 they delivered two to the house across the street and its been vacant since last october

2740472 hey turn up the wireless will you i think i heard something worthwhile
2740473 that the wizengamots got tongues all over britain wagging with their latest faux pas in the dolohov trial
2740474 he says hell give up the other death eaters in exchange for a ticket out of azkaban and the ministry is biting is this a deal with the devil
2740475 there is of course this quaint little potion called veritaserum perhaps theyve heard of it that might loosen his tongue then the ministry wouldnt have to loosen his chains but ministry officials claim
2740476 cant you do something to keep it on the magical side of things
2740477 wont be having a former death eater prowling free but will life as a squib suit mr dolohov
2740478 hell give up the death eaters and stay out of azkaban but he wont be allowed to do magic
2740479 the wizengamot is of course infamous for letting known death eaters walk free the last time was around
2740480 so what he wont be able to do magic in azkaban either
2740481 what is it why are you late is everything all right
2740482 ever heard the phrase the merchandise is just walking off the shelves
2740483 i spent half the morning trying to wrestle with and get them back on the shelves dont laugh

2740485 did i try of course i tried finite incanteum what do you take me for woman
2740486 what i need is a spell to tell me who is messing about with my products this is going beyond pranking
2740487 can you imagine old zonko in there cursing all the nosebleed nougat
2740488 i doubt the death eaters would waste their time pranking a joke shop if thats what youre thinking harry
2740489 but harry mate thatd be good for you wouldnt it i mean if they know where the death eaters are then we wont have to worry about them showing up here
2740490 so what are you going to do about the walking products
2740491 verity and allegra are coming in this afternoon and were going to try to figure it out
2740492 oh no i cant ron im sorry i didnt realize what time it was my parents took my grandmother out this morning and theyre probably back already and wondering where ive gone just what i need ill see you two tomorrow okay
2740493 youre probably hungry poor dear and ive locked you in here
2740494 i just went out for a bit i didnt know you had to be aware of my whereabouts at all times
2740495 just because you can disappear into thin air doesnt mean that you can come and go as you please
2740496 you are not permitted to leave this house without telling us
2740497 and you are certainly not allowed to to disappear or whatever it is you do
2740498 i am of age and should be able to disapparate as i like
2740499 magic does not give you the license to do as you please young lady
2740500 your abilities do not make you better than everyone else in this family nor do they exempt you from the rules of this household
2740501 how many times do i have to tell you that i did that for your own good
2740502 hermione grandma jean is sorting through some things in the attic go and give her a hand im tired of this constant quarrelling
2740503 well i certainly shouldnt be hunched over like this all day now should i thats what you young people are for
2740504 have a look through these boxes for any other loose photographs will you its appalling the state things are in i should have never left all of these things with your father when we moved to france
2740505 those are your cousins on granddad gabes side five boys and one girl in that family that lizzy was a firecracker though i suppose she had to be growing up with all those boys
2740506 well who did you think you got your good looks from your mothers side
2740507 twins russ was a mechanic he moved to america when he was in his twenties ruthie silly girl ran off with the love of her life when she was sixteen they eloped much to my mothers chagrin
2740508 eventually took some time though our family has an infamous stubborn streak hermione
2740509 her husband was killed in a car crash about ten years ago and ruthie passed on a few months later doctors never figured out why she just wasted away poor thing died from a broken heart bless her
2740510 lives in florida now with some woman half his age
2740511 are you the only child who didnt cause a scandal
2740512 oh i gave my mother a hard enough time when i was a young girl
2740513 she did a fine job raising the three of us on her own though funny how you dont appreciate it at the time
2740514 this was probably taken around 1932 the twins were born the next year and father died just a few months after they were born it was a an accident at work mother never really went into the details
2740515 but one does not forget when theyve seen magic real magic
2740516 she must have thought it was better for us children if we didnt know i think he got into some kind of trouble in that world you see i think thats why he died
2740517 the twins were just babies of course so they didnt remember but i did of course i still dont really understand it i know that there were others like him many others a whole world of people who could do magic and i remember him telling me once that i might have the magic too when i got older after he died mother tried to convince me it was just a make believe game i used to play with father eventually i gave up talking about it to her and the twins but i never forgot
2740518 i have long suspected that you are much more than an average girl
2740519 but dad he never knew before you never told dad about your father about magic
2740520 can you imagine a grown woman filling her sons mind with such nonsense
2740521 but there were times when i stopped believing there were times when i convinced myself it had been just a game or the product of a little girls overactive imagination flying on broomsticks and turning coat hangers into canaries it did seem silly but every now and then something inexplicable or bizarre would happen and i would remember father saying that strange things sometimes happened because something went wrong on your side and they had to fix things on ours and i would believe again
2740522 ive had to keep it a secret from you all this time and you knew
2740523 when you came to visit that one summer i kept looking for signs kept waiting for odd things to happen like they used to when you were small or when father was around but i suppose youve learned to be careful about that around people like me havent you
2740524 then your parents disappeared for a year just like that without telling anyone anything i knew something was wrong and that it probably had to do with or with your people so when i found out your mother and father were back i decided to see what was happening for myself
2740525 ive been waiting to see magic again for sixty five years
2740526 lord knows the house is big enough they come for the same reason that you and i and the regulars stay to get away from the world outside for awhile
2740527 i cant deny them that theyre like us sairey different from the norm and as this is a place where difference is the norm they can relax theres no need to try and fit in because everything fits in here
2740528 you dont know how easy a place like this would be to burgle
2740529 a locked door or latched window isnt going to stop them and besides anyones welcome here anyway
2740530 the house makes its own decisions about who stays and who goes
2740531 well the dallas mavericks got beat by the new orleans hornets last night ending their season word is that someone on the team is dating jessica simpson
2740532 it is written in the scriptures that god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son to die for the world that whosoever believeth on him and keepeth his commandments shall be saved but this sacrifice did not cost us very much freely given are all these glorious privileges
2740533 while we give nothing perhaps for this atonement and this sacrifice nevertheless it has cost someone something and i love to contemplate what it cost our father in heaven to give us the gift of his beloved son who so loved the world that he laid his life down to redeem the world to save us and to feed us spiritually while we walk in this life and prepare us to go and dwell with him in the eternal worlds
2740534 our father in heaven loved his son jesus christ for he had with him his son our redeemer in the eternal worlds faithful and true for ages
2740535 he saw that son condemned he saw him drag the cross through the streets of jerusalem and faint under its load
2740536 in that hour i think i can see our dear father his great heart almost breaking for the love that he had for his son
2740537 my brethren and sisters if i only knew how essential it was that i should receive the spiritual life that comes from that son i am sure i would always be present at the sacrament table to do honor to the gift that has come unto us

2740539 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2740540 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2740541 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2740542 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2740543 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2740544 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2740545 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2740546 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2740547 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2740548 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2740555 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

2740580 the voice of palestinian civilization with its pains sadness and ambitions
2740581 he turned the palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other arab issues

2740624 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
2740625 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
2740626 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
2740627 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
2740628 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage

2740659 its far easier less expensive and healthier to prevent a problem than to fix a crisis

2740663 being held responsible for bills years after service is unfair
2740664 i would propose legislation requiring that all claims be settled within 30 to 45 days reimbursement for medical services is the responsibility of the insurance company not the patient once an insurance card and co payment are presented payment should no longer be the patients concern if deductibles are met
2740665 currently shopping for health services is like dining at a restaurant with not prices on the menu most of us cant afford that kind of luxury
2740666 indiana must start requiring responsible use of medicaid dollars as well
2740667 we must give people an incentive whether its negative or positive to be responsible with the taxpayer benefits they receive other states are doing it we should too
2740668 its ridiculous the system will make a patient pay out of pocket to go home but will pay expenses if they remain in the hospital

2740670 we need to update benefits provided by taxpayers to reflect todays society
2740671 i want people to share in the joys of parenting but we need to do so sensibly
2740672 the formula is so inflexible that parents attempting to earn a little extra money for christmas presents will lose their childcare benefits with no childcare they cant work or go to school the result is many parents are forced back on full government assistance
2740673 we want to offer a hand up not force handouts
2740674 well be taking those people off unemployment medicaid and welfare and increasing the tax base not to mention generating almost 500 million in revenue for the state each year
2740675 i would propose legislation supporting an explosion of small business growth to facilitate this industry its a green strategy both financially and environmentally
2740676 the entire region needs sidewalks bike lanes and park and ride locations to facilitate regional commuting
2740677 more people are demanding flex time and the ability to telecommute at least part time employees want it and more employers find that its a viable alternative to having people in the office every day
2740678 people elect officials for much the same reason they hire doctors they want someone to watch out for their well being when warnings arise we expect to be alerted before disaster strikes if you have a stroke after your doctor says your high blood pressure or cholesterol are nothing to worry about youd get a new doctor if your legislator fails to avert crisis youd vote in a new legislator

2740705 esto tiene su porqu en primera instancia la delincuencia que tenemos en este momento y los niveles de sa a con los que han actuado tambi n provoca que quienes estamos legislando revisemos y volteemos a ver situaciones donde hablemos de cargas impositivas penalmente hablando m s fuertes

2740869 for about 45 minutes the spacecraft experienced a shower of meteoroids more intense than any leonid meteor storm weve ever seen on earth
2740870 there are many uncharted dust clouds in interplanetary space some are probably quite dense
2740871 we only know about the ones that happen to intersect earths orbit and cause meteor showers such as the perseids or leonids
2740872 of all nasas mars spacecraft mariner 4 was the only one weve sent with a micrometeoroid detector

2740883 there are no words to describe the terrible suffering of my people at this moment the chinese government is relentlessly crushing the tibetan people when they desire nothing more than the restoration of their basic rights and freedom tibetans are being killed silenced and marginalized our precious religion strangled as the chinese government attempts to extinguish all trace of tibetan identity i am protesting today to tell the world that while it stares mesmerized at chinas olympic games my people are being crushed under the boot of chinese oppression
2740884 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2740885 the olympics for china is a giant spectacle a game but for us its much more than that its a chance to call attention to what is happening in tibet
2740886 its important that we show the world that we stand up for those in prison and dying

2740918 he knew the culture he was also a surfer he understood all of that stuff
2740919 crawl up on the shore roll in the mud and the clay
2740920 for us it was wanting to roll around in the music the source right
2740921 the metaphor being the swallows would always build these beautiful mud nests they would also always come home to this beautiful mission it was gorgeous we always went there as kids in elementary school on field trips to the san juan capistrano mission
2740922 my parents would also take all our relatives that would come to visit there because it was so beautiful i remember it came to represent everything that was beautiful about southern california at the time so now of course there arent as many swallows coming back
2740923 the song was just about really wanting to get back and roll around in it again just roll around in the mud its kind of darwinian i guess very much about that primitive that primal scene
2740924 the first record in which the band has been involved in the creation of the whole project
2740925 and i mean from the very first the first song we wrote together was a song called slow down which closes the album i think it was two days later maybe that very night that i took it to the band we were playing antones and we ran through it at sound check and we played it that night we had a lot of gigs going on at that time so all these songs as they were coming we were playing them the very same night that they were written it was a year in writing the record by the time we prepared to make it we had been playing these songs for over a year
2740926 to work with tony visconti was a dream come true really
2740927 hes playing it on his recorder and then he writes out these perfect charts for a string quartet and theyre very well written he hands them out to the strings and they go over it a couple of times and its done and there you have it its an all in one thing with tony
2740928 not only is tony qualified with all these talents hes a wonderful human being too so it was a pleasure a real pleasure
2740929 my parents told me we were going on a vacation we never went back to texas we left everything behind i mean we left our horse we left the dog the cats everything we were literally going on vacation it was my grandmother my mom my dad and all the kids in this little sedan stuffed into this complete grapes of wrath thing and we went west you know
2740930 he said that we left because of discrimination in texas and that the unions in california which they didnt have in texas made it a right to work state
2740931 surfing surf music all the great ballrooms that were having bands
2740932 and this one record store where this guy would order me all the import records from england and all the magazines im reading about bowie and those guys in sounds and nme and melody maker and stuff like that
2740933 i really wanted to address the fact that the children of these men who crossed the border and started new families in the southwest courageously and recklessly were now immersed in this new sixties culture
2740934 surfing was an anglo kind of thing very racist in a way and in the chicano culture you were abandoning your culture by wanting to be a surfer
2740935 so i was stuck in this kind of they used to think i was hawaiian as a surfer right i would go for it so i wouldnt get my ass kicked so i was hawaiian for the day or whatever it took to get out of some hairy situation its an interesting thing ive always wanted to write a whole thing about that
2740936 we just wanted to make this film based on the stooges in a loose way like iggys song the dum dum boys
2740937 its one of those things where we never should have been a band
2740938 san francisco had such a bohemian atmosphere wed go around north beach and hand out free tickets to the cockettes what was left of them the angels of light and you know bruce conner and all the people who hung out at city lights bookstore so it was a slightly older crowd a totally different trip we brought in all kinds of things it was a multimedia circus in san francisco
2740939 the nuns could never find a gig because san francisco was pretty much run by bill graham so for bands like us to play you had to find your own gig or find somebody who was crazy enough to let you play in a bar
2740940 we got a gig on fishermans wharf it was one of those things where they had the speakers out on the street to lure the tourists in as soon as we plugged in and cranked it up within half a song they threw us out of the bar we had lost our gig right away so we went back to our rehearsal studio on folsom street and put up a sign if you came to see the nuns were at so and so address on folsom the only two people that showed up were chip and tony who had come to see us so they came to our rehearsal and we performed for them we did our full set for our girlfriends and chip and tony
2740941 chelsea hotel 78 describes living in the new york landmark where he moved just after the nuns had opened for the sex pistols final show at winterland in san francisco 1978 it was punk time
2740942 we came to new york we lived in the chelsea and we toured the east coast by amtrak we were on 5 per diem back then i remember the day that i came down to the lobby and sid was checking in him and nancy with jerry nolan and johnny thunders of the new york dolls in tow
2740943 we played at rauls it was still open the armadillo had just closed and i just fell in love
2740944 i remember calling new york and saying i wanna move here
2740945 everyone was just so friendly and the food was so great and the musicians i mean suddenly i see townes van zandt in person for the first time blaze foley is there pat mears jubal clark all these great songwriters man
2740946 the first solo album 1992s gravity is really the austin experience that and thirteen years
2740947 with this record i really wanted to get away from those things i didnt want to address the things that i had on the boxing mirror im done as far as thats concerned
2740948 that was huge you know how you think youre prepared for all these things i was not prepared
2740949 the boxing mirror is a really beautiful album a dark album somewhat dark not in a downer way but it addresses some serious things you know with this album i just wanted to tell a story i wanted it to be like a movie
2740950 if you asked me what my music is like i really couldnt answer that in one sentence i couldnt give you a sound bite
2740951 because its about so many things its about my brothers bands the larger bands and the arrangements of duke ellington which somehow seeped into all the stuff that i was doing then you take sleepwalk by santo amp johnny and brian eno mott the hoople and ian hunters songwriting you take all those things and throw them into one thing and somehow you come up with what weve tried to create over the years
2740952 close your eyes and you can hear the music in the wind

2740998 scientists understand how complex systems work im a pattern hunter so i created a system that was looking for patterns and was adaptive and self learning
2740999 the creative process is quite similar in both research i think any type of research and writing
2741000 when i first started writing i didnt write about scientists at all i think i wanted a break from that part of my world but when i did start writing about researchers i found the work that came out was much better than anything id ever done and i think it was because i had a real investment and interest and deep knowledge of the material of some of the issues that drive these kinds of people at this point i cant imagine not writing about researchers because im able to find a little bit of myself in every character i write about and thats i think the key to good writing
2741001 it is one of the central questions of my fiction this coexistence of reason and passion and the points in life where reason and passion collide research is a great vehicle to investigate it because you have on the surface this rational analytical discipline but you also have people who are so invested in the research so wrapped up in it that they become extremely passionate its an interesting dichotomy
2741002 being a researcher and a writer are different forms of enjoyment human beings have this depressing property they can become desensitized to even the most pleasurable things for me being stimulated in radically different ways is great its wonderful to be able to do such different things on a daily basis
2741003 for me as a young writer slash researcher there was always a perception that i would have to choose between doing one or the other that the research community wouldnt take me seriously if i was writing and that as a writer there would be no time to have an intense day job but you know its not true theres time to do lots of things in life and doing research certainly doesnt mean that you cant also be an artist or a musician or a writer or whatever else interests you i hope that young people who are studying science wont get the sense that thats all that they can do and that their minds will be closed to the arts

2741040 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2741041 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2741042 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2741043 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2741044 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2741048 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2741049 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2741051 there is just no reason why newborn babies must be dressed in just white pink or pale blue

2741068 initially we used to have frequent quarrels and fights with my husband because whenever the child got sick or there was no salt at home i would confront him to give me the money he would always tell me he lacks it but now i can cater for both the children and my husband
2741069 he now respects me and doesnt undertake any family decisions without seeking my consent he finally decided to also join the savings scheme
2741070 im sorry to say it but now the dictatorships of the 60s and 70s are being replaced by some groups that take airports occupy electoral offices and take shots at ministers cars
2741071 it has a disproportionate influence on the space in terms of its overwhelming smell the cultural idea of it and the operational problems created by the mess it produces
2741072 if he does not resign which would be the most honourable course for him he will be impeached it will be first time in the history of pakistan
2741073 rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2741074 i know that its not possible that this child could be mine because of the timing of events
2741075 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
2741076 i dont know if the us are felt about the same way
2741077 this is a very large city this seems to be a tragic incident a tragic occurrence obviously for the family but beyond that i couldnt comment on the details
2741078 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of our willingness to stop military confrontation
2741079 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2741080 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2741081 a lot of people i know are on welfare and i know there is no way they can get enough fuel to get around so they dont go out
2741082 rates are huge and house prices have gone through the roof
2741083 i think everybody is hit worse here because they are isolated from public transport and the council has put up the rates and it is really affecting people
2741084 there has been talk of extending the tram line but the government doesnt want to listen
2741085 a significant development and a great credit to our special forces
2741086 but while the shadow governors capture will undoubtedly disrupt taliban activities in oruzgan province the broader challenge for the nato partners in afghanistan remains significant
2741087 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently under way what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2741088 we didnt hear about the snow but thought wed come down because it was cold enough for it
2741089 its something different and we didnt need to travel far
2741090 many people were coming up to the area for sightseeing which was causing some dramas
2741091 we expect to see pe take advantage of good buying opportunities created in the current economic uncertainty basically sound but temporarily distressed assets that investors have lost faith in but these opportunities have the potential to yield high long term value
2741092 pe success was based on business fundamentals creating value from good management
2741093 i am glad you have given me those two alternatives can i suggest a third lest i be verballed by a distinguished representative from an australian newspaper and it is this
2741094 and their relationship with australia is very deep and very broad
2741095 it doesnt make sense theres no such limit in the world the australian principles are contrary to those of the wto
2741096 this afternoon i spoke for the second time since the crisis began with georgian president saakashvili
2741097 given this threat to euro atlantic security i am pleased to see the united states the european union and nato acting together by sending a delegation to the region in an effort to broker a cease fire this is an important first step
2741098 the united nations has been prevented from taking any meaningful action by russian objections in view of this i welcome the statements of democratic nations defending the sovereignty of georgia and condemning russian actions
2741099 i strongly support the declaration issued by the presidents of poland estonia latvia and lithuania and their commitment that aggression against a small country in europe will not be passed over in silence or with meaningless statements equating the victims with the victimizers
2741100 i am pleased the u s has agreed to facilitate the transfer of georgian troops serving bravely in iraq who are now unfortunately needed to defend their own country
2741101 foreign journalists will not limit their activities to the games themselves
2741102 they will also cover politics science technology and the economy

2741107 i dont have any business dealing with johns personal life nor do i want to
2741108 but if john wants help with his golf swing im happy to do it hes got unbelievable ability as everybody knows and i really think he wants to play better i like john as a person because he has a big heart and i like his ability which involves more than just hitting the ball a mile hes got great hands a wonderful touch around the greens
2741109 i was surprised at the transition how different it was from yesterday to today
2741110 i thought it would be a little firmer a little faster but it got a lot firmer and a lot faster thats going to make it play pretty difficult on the weekend unless we get some rain
2741111 the only way to make it fair is to cut all the rough out i think the us open was set up perfectly it rewards accuracy and penalizes you if you are off liner i didnt see that today i asked my partners if i was out of order and they said no if you are slightly off line you are crucified in my opinion it is too thick around the greens as well it takes the skill away from chipping yoy dont need it the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2741112 oh wow must really be struggling out on the golf course today
2741113 o regulamento s exige ineditismo no rio grande do sul
2741114 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
2741115 the guy got introduced like he was the president added giants linebacker antonio pierce
2741116 he got the broadway sign hes on the paper every day that must be nice for him
2741117 i think hes going to realize the media here is a little different than green bay hes not going to control it
2741118 yeah he already got a key to the city too actually he didnt im not saying the value of that key has gone down at all it was quite a warm welcome but i think everybody knows that in new york it doesnt last long thats why its such a great city to play for
2741119 after all it is our heritage that shapes our future
2741120 weve been trying for the last two years to do something with them they seem to think this history belongs to them
2741121 this is our towns history it shouldnt go to the highest bidder
2741122 this is the kind of simple non compliance that has frustrated citizens here for a long time
2741123 we dont have industry or jobs were trying to build tourism history is important
2741124 a lot of people would joke that he had legs of steel
2741125 liquids should be thick like a strawberry milkshake strawberry ensure or whole milk take note too that i emphasized strawberry something i love
2741126 i want the service to be of celebration not of sadness i want people to come as themselves as i have known them and not something they feel is necessarily appropriate in the attire to attend a funeral i want folks to bring balloons and markers and if they dont know what to do with them then they should write a note on the balloon and let it go and ill be sure to get it
2741127 from day one its like everything is so organized all cut and dry this is what i need to do there it is all set hes just been so level headed and here he is hes good natured and happy to be with people
2741128 i try and let family and friends know im ok as i really am
2741129 i will be aware always of what you and others are doing so never allow anyone to think they cant still communicate with me even in the most extreme circumstances i will want that communication even if it appears one sided
2741130 and hell have someone pick up some batman comic books to read and show me during those times
2741131 discuss impowering sender skills non verbal skills in other countries pls answer this explain to me what is communication pitfalls in business for business man and woman en espa ol
2741132 you think those thread that brotha is sportin are cheap
2741133 any notion of human progress is negated by the existence of the iliad
2741134 if they could do it we can do it to
2741135 the iphone does a lot that the palm never could
2741136 any notion of human progress is negated by the existence of the iliad
2741137 i just feel for my white brothers and sisters coming here to teach those kids will eat you alive
2741138 we dont intend to take the initiative to escalate the conflict at this time
2741139 over the past few years i lived in a democratic country and i was happy now america and the european union spit on us
2741140 the lawbreakers drove a taxi to the local public security office industry and business administration and other sites and tossed homemade explosives destroying two police vehicles
2741141 were known to have been killed in a series of explosions
2741142 the circumstances are still unclear our leaders havent determined the nature of the incident yet
2741143 i dont know exactly what happened but whatever it was will make them even more worried about stability
2741144 want to use the platform of the olympics to amplify the effects
2741145 chinas policies of repression are making the situation more acute
2741146 im not ready to date seriously again after breaking up with a guy id been with for three years but i have this ex boyfriend who im still friendly with his ap
2741147 i broke up with the guy id been dating for ages because he was a failure between the sheets
2741148 my folks went away for a few days and left me alone in the house
2741149 if georgian officials request it we will facilitate the transfer within a relatively short amount of time
2741150 we have communicated with the russians what our obligations are
2741151 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2741152 i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2741153 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2741154 this is a true testament to the importance you place on relations with china
2741155 she would take the tip in her mouth and just lick the head
2741156 i still love all muslims has built over 400 shelters in poor muslim villages the project helped swing rural mindanao sentiments in favor of christians macanas said
2741157 when abu sayyaf members kidnap and kill they also kidnap and kill muslims in the sept 11 2001 attacks in the united states many of those killed were muslims although no one talks about it abdullah said
2741158 the dumalondong they are doing is no longer a tribal affair but more of an activity of the catholic church
2741159 because outsiders must not be allowed to intervene in the processes of their sacred rituals
2741160 we also teach nutrition education or proper feeding that is not costly this includes promoting breastfeeding so that we would not need to import milk from other countries
2741161 we really should be insisting they should wear their team gear i think that might be a small precaution i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for you security and volunteers if you are in olympic gear
2741162 nadziej na wy onienie si w gruzji nowego kierownictwa politycznego sk onnego do wsp pracy z moskw nie tak ch tnego aspiracjom europejskim czy natowskim jak prezydent saakaszwili
2741163 the left parties are in principle opposed to the creation of smaller states be it gorkhaland vidarbha telangana etc
2741164 if there is such a proposal at par with our demands we will agree when it comes to us in writing
2741165 i have no information on this and i will comment only after getting such a proposal in writing
2741166 however if such an order is at par with our demands we will agree to it but only after it reaches to us in writing
2741167 they are doing so much of blackmail on this issue
2741168 i didn t know where else to put this so i ll just put it here ill just put it here i think im addicted to the tv im really really serious it seems to be the only thing that matters to me if i miss a show its devastating to me its ruined my life i wouldnt do my homework because a show would be on i wouldnt pratice piano or dance because a show would be on i dont do anything but watch the tv i dont spend time with my parents in the short time of the day theyre actually home i just watch tv and i dont know how to stop i want to stop i want to not be addicted anymore because it is seriously ruining my life i am really serious about this this is not a joke
2741169 kno how u feel im like that tooo i have to watch my shows lol or ill die my mom is the same way with some shows buh i dont think its that serious buh try to make a chart of how much u watch tv and then try to limit the amount u watch maybe that will work buh i dont see anything wrong with it
2741170 lynn lynn the city of sin you never come out the way you went in wine whiskey women and gin lynn lynn the city of sin
2741171 weve focused the whole year on this and this win shows what a brilliant athlete she cooke is a lot of people doubted her throughout the year when she wasnt going to as many races
2741172 it was quite a composed row and we know that the germans are unbeaten in the olympic games in the womens quad so we knew how they would be
2741173 the demographics entirely different from what it was a few years ago
2741174 sorry im not sure which team it is riding in the grey and green jersey
2741175 the payoff for both automakers was about a 40 savings in development costs
2741176 right now gm is evaluating products from a company called a123 working with continental and a company called cpi working with lg chem
2741177 thats not the real snow white its just my mommy in a costume
2741178 dying is for amateurs but getting older its like me priceless
2741179 today the people of the republic of china have been given an opportunity and with this opportunity comes great responsibility confucius say great men must be celebrated in great way and in that spirit it is my pleasure to be the one to officially commence the s birthday p s perky you should come back and visit sometime
2741180 i should sooner live in a society governed by the first two thousand names in the boston telephone directory than in a society governed by the two thousand faculty members of harvard university
2741181 we are very happy with the result it was the most important thing today
2741182 we conceded a goal early in the match and that made things difficult for us
2741183 and after the two players were ejected it was even more difficult
2741184 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
2741185 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation
2741186 that last task is very important because unless youve got lots and lots of vehicles with the better technology the impact is limited
2741187 the need to bring better technology into production and build up volume inevitably makes the time frames for technologies to make a difference long optimists want to move faster but its not clear we can really do it much faster
2741188 transitioning from our current situation onto a path with declining fuel consumption and emissions even in the developed world will take several decades much longer than we had hoped or realized
2741189 this is another important milestone in our revolutionary battery development
2741190 we are beginning to see customers seeking out our products for the unique characteristics that only altairnano technology can provide
2741191 the current program is only a beginning once the technology is proven in the field we fully expect interest and supply contracts from other u s and foreign military services
2741192 altairnano is proud to help improve the effectiveness of the men and women defending our nation
2741193 whoever you are from wherever you are how you are welcome
2741194 the thrust of this campaign was set months ago and is continuing forward theres no special plan to change that
2741195 in august of 2016 when the games will be celebrated in madrid we wont need to adopt special measures of any type to guarantee a transportation system adequate temperature for the sports competitions we now have levels of pollution that are way below very demanding european standards
2741196 eta considered a terrorist group by spain the european union and the u
2741197 were not here to watch what our competitors do were here to run our own race
2741198 after these chinese olympics and the anglo saxon ones to be held in london the best way to internationalize the movement would be to hold a latin games in madrid
2741199 were like latinos but we work with a swiss touch
2741200 i could have given up at the start but that wouldnt have been fair on the team
2741201 we make enhancements throughout the park on a regular basis
2741202 well continue to offer guests a wide variety of food choices
2741203 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
2741204 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
2741205 in order to guarantee yourself a specified minimum future income regardless of market swings if your contract is annuitized election in grip ii is irrevocable and a fee of 45 of the income base will be charged on each contract anniversary or upon full withdrawal

2741208 has the fed done research that allows it to find the market rate of interest so that it doesnt make the cost of borrowing artificially too low or too high
2741209 is there any reason to believe that fed bureaucrats have the necessary information and ability to successfully fix the price of money ie interest rates in a 12 trillion economy of 350 million people when free markets are more successful at fixing market clearing prices for all other commodities
2741210 were planning to expand rapidly were scaling up to some big numbers
2741211 this is the opportunity of a lifetime for zap and we are ready to seize the moment

2741214 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2741215 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2741216 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas
2741217 its fun to watch manny do his thing frandsen said
2741218 thats the role i had last year so i know how hard it is
2741219 you dont know if the giants will give me that chance frandsen said
2741220 im not saying that in a negative way but its the truth theres no way to know i hope i left a lasting impression by what i did last september i always have to prove myself you have to earn everything i understand that
2741221 if i go is it supposed to be performance based
2741222 wed have to be sure hes 100 percent and theres no risk involved giants manager bruce bochy said
2741223 thats the only way hes going to pitch this year
2741224 if youre running for president you get on a pedestal
2741225 motorcades happen for you you get the adulation of crowds and if you get to be president all the planes stop when your plane takes off and when you die youre on a stamp he one thing you cant do is to cheat
2741226 the reason why the john edwards thing i think is so striking is the other way the rules have changed
2741227 the press which never used to cover private matters does
2741228 i think that a lot of the focus of the affair actually has been about its impact on elizabeth edwards
2741229 obviously elizabeth edwards story her fight with cancer the fact that shes well liked and has very high regard i think is what has really made this story stick a little bit more than maybe it would for somebody else
2741230 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007
2741231 you know that when you die when anyone dies youre going to leave a bunch of headaches behind for the people behind us in addition the fact that theyll miss us of course and so im trying to minimize that to the extent that i can
2741232 gotta do something with your day and thats what i choose to do
2741233 venha para o lado negro n s temos carne de porco
2741234 nee vraag ons niet om taal als een lijst met een strakke rand rond ons vormloos gevoelen die dat helder maakt
2741235 i met her several times before and remember that it always went to three sets
2741236 xie had a first round bye and will next face olga konon of belarus in the third round konon defeated slovenias maja tvrdy 21 17 21 14
2741237 ive played her before so i knew what to expect
2741238 zhang is only seventh in the world rankings and has struggled with injuries this year but was picked over 2007 world champion zhu lin who is third in the world rankings
2741239 uh do you mind if i wait in here while the parents pick up the kids
2741240 you mean hide in here while the parents pick up their kids
2741241 that i do mind my name is sandra not sandals
2741242 yeah i didnt figure you for a nickname type of woman
2741243 ah but you need to loosen up thats why im going to call you sandals
2741244 you know typically a nickname is shorter than the given name
2741245 that sounds like a line from one of your movies
2741246 please dont flatter yourself i just meant that it sounds like a very generic line from a very generic movie
2741247 okay if it makes you feel better ill give you a truth thatll show you i can be human too
2741248 i doubt one piece of trivia will accomplish that enormous feat
2741249 itll pass the time while we wait for the kids to be picked up
2741250 i was thinking more along the lines of truth or dare but okay we can play whatever game you like
2741251 waiting to find out what game you want to play

2741253 financial planning should be an integral part of the divorce process the earlier the financial advisor becomes involved the less likely the situation will escalate out of control
2741254 until recently the attorneys and mediators did it all themselves financial and emotional counseling along with the legal work
2741255 today attorneys understand and appreciate more than ever the value we bring to their practices
2741256 they can concentrate on the legal work and allow professional divorce financial planners to handle the complexity of providing financial solutions that work on a short term basis and long term as well
2741257 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time

2741269 uncle whats the difference between a hypothetical question and a realistic question
2741270 go upstairs and ask your mother if shed make love to the mailman for 50 000
2741271 mom said shed make love with anyone for 50 000
2741272 go and ask your sister if shed make love with the neighbor for 50 000
2741273 my sister said shed make love with anyone for 50 000

2741435 wales has had an incredible sporting year with joe calzaghe the welsh rugby grand slam cardiff city in the fa cup final and now olympic gold
2741436 a 75 mile road race in those conditions of driving rain lightning and with the swede and italian alongside her who were favourites with her and then to out kick them in the last 200m to win the olympic gold for wales was incredible
2741437 i also won on a rainy sunday and as i was watching i thought about what it must have been like for people back home in wales listening to the fact id won olympic gold in tokyo in very similar wind and rain and horrendous conditions
2741438 this moment will change her whole life she will be recognised for the rest of her life for winning the very pinnacle of sporting achievement

2741441 shes one of the most dedicated sportspeople i know and you have to be that to be a cyclist and particularly to be an endurance cyclist
2741442 shes had knee surgery and what incredible strength of character and mental toughness to come back and win the olympic title in beijing
2741443 its fantastic for wales and will lift the rest of the team
2741444 theyll be thinking if nicole can do it we can do it and the cycling team promises to win more golds

2741550 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march 2007
2741551 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2741552 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue

2741556 my argument has always been that if youre going to have preschool its not inappropriate for the state to set some minimum standards
2741557 it should always be up to the parent to decide if the child will participate

2741590 it is important that the un aid agencies and african governments respond appropriately to the reality of home based care and womens other unpaid work in the southern africa region

2741597 unlike america denmark which was so badly hammered by the 1973 arab oil embargo that it banned all sunday driving for a while responded to that crisis in such a sustained focused and systematic way that today it is energy independent
2741598 a toxic combination of 4 gasoline voter anxiety and presidential ambition is making it impossible for this country to have the grown up conversation it needs about energy here is the underlying reality a nation that uses one quarter of the world s oil while possessing less than 3 percent of its reserves cannot drill its way to happiness at the pump much less self sufficiency the only plausible strategy is to cut consumption while embarking on a serious program of alternative fuels and energy sources this is a point the honest candidate should be making at every turn
2741599 i am glad you have given me those two alternatives can i suggest a third lest i be verballed by a distinguished representative from an australian newspaper and it is this what was great is that the ambassador was able to organise at the residence heads of many chinese corporations who for us are very old friends friends who have been trading with australia for 10 years 20 years 30 years going back a long long time and their relationship with australia is very deep and very broad

2741603 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2741604 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2741605 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2741608 take your thong off and well have some fun on the way home
2741609 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2741610 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2741611 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2741612 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2741613 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2741628 we added some things we think will help us but other than that a lot of it is the same basic approach said lynn who has 38 years of experience coaching at the pro and college levels
2741629 the biggest improvements that were made a year ago probably were not noted on the scoreboard and probably were not noted in terms of yards per game there is an attitude change i think thats carried over and we hope that it will continue in that direction and get better and better and better
2741630 i cant predict a date for the decision hopefully before the first game
2741631 its very competitive because nobody has stepped up to take the job

2741659 the united states will not permit the worlds most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the worlds most destructive weapons
2741660 we reached agreement on the need to take care of the iranian threat
2741661 george bush understands the severity of the iranian threat and the need to vanquish it and intends to act on the matter before the end of his term the iranian problem requires urgent attention and i see no reason to delay this just because there will be a new president in the white house seven and a half months from now
2741662 if iran continues its nuclear weapons program we will attack it
2741663 just as the israelis are mounting a full court press to get the bush administration to strike irans nuclear complex
2741664 the israelis have been assured by the bush administration that the bush administration will not allow iran to nuclearize
2741665 israelis are uncertain about what would be the policies of the next administration vis vis iran
2741666 keep in mind that israel does not have strategic bombers
2741667 the israeli air force is not the american air force israel cannot eliminate irans nuclear program
2741668 the iranians according to israeli security sources will have an operable nuclear weapon by 2009 thats not a very long time

2741771 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
2741772 unwillingness to change what has been received in faith from scripture and tradition
2741773 the practice and public language of the church act always as a reminder that the onus of proof is on those who seek a new understanding
2741774 nor despite regular accusations is this prioritising of the bishops task mere pragmatism or the pursuit of a quixotic goal of anglican unity it expresses what jesus himself taught the fundamental and deeply biblical teaching on the vital importance of church unity and of working for that unity by humility and mutual submission
2741775 a recipe for a blatant erastianism against which the archbishop has resolutely set his face
2741776 in his invitations to the lambeth conference dr williams insisted that he saw the windsor report 2004 and the proposed anglican covenant as the tracks along which the communion should move in his final presidential address to the conference he articulated clearly and sharply where we now are as a church the reaffirmation of the uniqueness of jesus christ as the way the truth and the life the reaffirmation of the previous lambeth resolution on sexual behavior the moratoria on same sex blessings on consecration of any more practising homosexuals as bishops and on the incursions by bishops into one anothers territories the anglican covenant and some key interim arrangements while that covenant undergoes further drafting he presented these in the context of a powerful and clearly thought out address as the fresh articulation of the mind of the church not as an opinion which he was bound to express but from which he privately wanted to dissent

2741849 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2741850 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2741851 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
2741852 over the past few years i lived in a democratic country and i was happy now america and the european union spit on us
2741853 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2741854 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2741855 russia for lord only knows what reason seems to have imperial ambitions in the tiny insignificant territory of south ossetia
2741856 how many divisions do you think i should use to invade the soviet union
2741857 i think we should step back and let another country of the un take the reins preferably one in europe
2741858 gee i wonder where those pesky russians ever got the idea to expand their empire into tiny insignificant countries that had nothing to do with 9 11 i dont get it
2741859 the majority of the roughly 70 000 people living in south ossetia are ethnically distinct from georgians they say they were forcibly absorbed into georgia under soviet rule and now want to exercise their right to self determination
2741860 in my view the strongest force of all one which grew and took fresh shapes and forms every day war the force not of any one individual but was that unmistakable sense of unanimity among the peoples of the world that war must somehow be averted the peoples of the british empire were at one with those of germany of france and of italy and their anxiety their intense desire for peace pervaded the whole atmosphere of the conference and i believe that that and not threats made possible the concessions that were made
2741861 non democratic nation russia has the right to invade a democratic nation georgia
2741862 the next question is what should the world do about it
2741863 it is well known that georgia has wmd harbors terrorists is an imminent threat to russia and was involved in the 9 11 attacks russia has every right to invade georgia and anyone who says otherwise is with the terrorists
2741864 the russians needless to say are not neutral as between mccain and obama
2741865 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government said obama spokesman hari sevugan
2741866 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
2741867 the mccain camp responded with this statement the obama campaigns attacks on randy scheunemann are disgraceful mr scheunemann proudly represented a small democracy that is one of our closest allies in a very dangerous region today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about senator obamas judgment it answers them

2741874 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2741875 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
2741876 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
2741877 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
2741878 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital

2741880 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
2741881 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
2741882 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
2741883 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly

2741888 el trabajo del rbitro no tengo que juzgarlo desconozco por qu motivo repiti el penal pero eso fue clave para abrir el marcador aunque al final el partido termin empatado
2741889 por otro lado sumamos seguimos con una buena racha en casa tenemos mucho tiempo de no perder aqu creo que hemos hecho del estadio jalisco una plaza fuerte aunque en esta ocasi n nos deja insatisfechos el hecho de no haber conseguido los tres puntos

2741899 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2741901 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2741902 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2741903 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2741904 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2741905 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2741906 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2741907 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2741908 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2741909 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2741910 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2741911 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2741912 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2741913 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2741914 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2741920 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2741921 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2741922 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2741923 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2741924 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2741925 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2741926 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2741927 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2741928 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2741929 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2741930 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2741931 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2741932 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2741933 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2741934 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2741935 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2741936 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2741937 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2741938 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2741939 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2741940 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2741941 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2741942 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2741943 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2741944 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2741945 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2741946 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2741947 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2741948 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2741949 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2741950 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2741951 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2741952 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2741953 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2741954 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2741955 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2741956 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2741957 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2741958 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2741959 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2741960 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2741961 who are open to doing something on the production side
2741962 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2741963 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2741964 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2741965 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2741966 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2741967 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2741968 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2741969 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2741970 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2741971 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2741972 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2741973 oui respirer cest vivre mais respirer lentement cest vivre longtemps et en bonne sant
2741974 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2741975 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2741976 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2741977 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2741978 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2741979 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2741980 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2741981 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2741982 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2741983 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2741984 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2741985 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2741986 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2741987 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2741988 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

2742115 voor mij is het digitaal bijhouden van de administratie een absolute must omdat mijn handen regelmatig spastisch zijn schrijven gaat daardoor erg moeilijk epgb is overzichtelijk en snel je kunt van minuut tot minuut de geleverde zorg en begeleiding verantwoorden hoewel ik de besteding van mijn pgb ook al digitaal verantwoordde via het systeem van pzn moest ik wel even wennen aan het werken met epgb het systeem is weliswaar beter en sneller maar het is natuurlijk allemaal net even anders waardoor ik alles opnieuw moest uitvinden gelukkig kon ik bellen naar de helpdesk van epgb e n belletje en ze helpen je overal doorheen
2742116 mijn vaste hulpen werken doorgaans op vaste dagen en hebben vaste taken
2742117 dit betekent dat ik in mijn epgb maar een keer de gegevens juist hoef in te vullen en vervolgens op herhalen kan klikken deze functie in het systeem zorgt ervoor dat de planning van de ene week met n druk op de knop gekopieerd wordt
2742118 het is leuk om te zien dat wanneer je een verbeterpunt doorgeeft daar ook echt iets mee wordt gedaan de mensen van de helpdesk zijn erg vriendelijk je hoeft geen digitaal wonder te zijn om met dit systeem te kunnen werken als je er even de tijd voor neemt en je laat helpen door mensen van de helpdesk dan heb je het zo onder de knie zelf ben ik best wel een digibeet maar ik vind het super makkelijk en raad het iedereen aan zeker als je meerdere hulpverleners in dienst hebt biedt het systeem zon uitkomst ik moet 20 uur per dag op bed liggen en ben door dit systeem gewoon in staat om zelf alles te regelen ik ben dan wel de hele dag afhankelijk van zorg maar heb die wel zelf in de hand dat is voor mij heel belangrijk
2742119 the northern territory election is a reminder to all of us in politics that the australian people will hold us accountable this is an important lesson for all of us in politics particularly those of us who are currently in government
2742120 i dont know that id say generally the tide is turning against labor these are always case by case
2742121 kevin rudd promised to end the so called blame game and this has exposed the incompetence of labor governments across australia and voters have reacted by delivering large swings against labor at every opportunity
2742122 this sends a message to the rudd government that it must start to make difficult decisions to protect australias prosperity and it will not be able to spend its entire first term focused on populist stunts and media grabs
2742123 no one in the nt believed mr hendersons reasons for calling an early election and everyone in wa can see through the reasons mr carpenter called an early election
2742124 my strong view is that governments are elected to serve their term and thats my intention
2742125 docs simply cannot support the management of a foster care association by individuals who have themselves been banned from caring for children in foster care
2742126 the fca was unfortunately unable to show sufficient cause as to why its funding should be extended
2742127 its unacceptable to have de registered carers in positions of authority in this organisation
2742128 i told them i dont believe i should have to pay and even if i did i dont have 86 000 they informed me that they have the power to take my house off me and sell it and take the money
2742129 so when i heard the premier was telling people to build and rent out granny flats i just flipped what hypocrisy
2742130 what mr kyriacous case shows is that individuals that seek to do the right thing to provide additional accommodation are then penalised under existing state laws
2742131 but the office of state revenue operates on the basis that it will pursue you unless you can prove differently in court
2742132 its a state government desperate to raise as much revenue as possible because of their appalling financial management
2742133 basically the government has the right to say you owe us money and its up to me to prove they are wrong
2742134 if the premier wants us all to build granny flats then thousands of people could be in the same situation
2742135 if i was cynical i would say it could be a back door way of increasing tax revenue
2742136 however the owner needs to be able to satisfy the office of state revenue that the property is in fact used as their primary residence
2742137 were determined to build a strong investment climate that helps create new accommodation to ease the rental squeeze
2742138 you dont need an ugly face on posters to win you just need a nice little friendly chicken i think voters see that as not aggressive
2742139 it was a dark grey object and it was flying parallel to the ground
2742140 i would think about what the government has done look at its record

2742148 i am not quite sure what all the stephen ireland rumour is about
2742149 there was a bit of confusion about stephen before the game against milan but i had a word with him before the game and explained my interpretation of it it has been sorted out and i explained my understanding of it
2742150 at this time of the year a lot of agents are flying around and at times some are of a view that they can start to exercise some interest in their clients
2742151 anything we have said in regards of stephen has been misinterpreted and people have run away with it
2742152 he is staying absolutely he is staying sunderland has been mentioned but there has been no contact in that respect

2742173 the problem last year is we werent consistent wed give up the 70 yard play then wed come back and step up on the next downs this year weve got to come out with that same intensity and focus every play
2742174 we added some things we think will help us but other than that a lot of it is the same basic approach said lynn who has 38 years of experience coaching at the pro and college levels
2742175 the biggest improvements that were made a year ago probably were not noted on the scoreboard and probably were not noted in terms of yards per game there is an attitude change i think thats carried over and we hope that it will continue in that direction and get better and better and better

2742188 its up there with any sporting achievement i can think of
2742189 wales has had an incredible sporting year with joe calzaghe the welsh rugby grand slam cardiff city in the fa cup final and now olympic gold
2742190 a 75 mile road race in those conditions of driving rain lightning and with the swede and italian alongside her who were favourites with her and then to out kick them in the last 200m to win the olympic gold for wales was incredible
2742191 i also won on a rainy sunday and as i was watching i thought about what it must have been like for people back home in wales listening to the fact id won olympic gold in tokyo in very similar wind and rain and horrendous conditions
2742192 this moment will change her whole life she will be recognised for the rest of her life for winning the very pinnacle of sporting achievement
2742193 those memories live with you forever and people will recall this in 30 years the fact that nicole cooke a 25 year old from south wales beat the rest of the world at the beijing games
2742194 its very hard to sum up what it means shes based herself in italy and trained with professional cyclists
2742195 shes one of the most dedicated sportspeople i know and you have to be that to be a cyclist and particularly to be an endurance cyclist
2742196 shes had knee surgery and what incredible strength of character and mental toughness to come back and win the olympic title in beijing
2742197 its fantastic for wales and will lift the rest of the team
2742198 theyll be thinking if nicole can do it we can do it and the cycling team promises to win more golds

2742214 may be to the u s economy what an inconvenient truth was to the environment
2742215 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2742216 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2742217 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2742218 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2742219 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2742220 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2742221 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2742222 com dois gols de ronaldinho brasil goleia e avan a s quartas de final
2742223 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2742237 the newspapers are in trouble its not like it used to be there was more space theres now talk about the web anyone who wants to test their mettle can put their mistakes on the web and get feedback comic strips are a little play anyone who doesnt work for an audience isnt going to make it the web is great for comic strip artists and animators

2742244 c ountries have to be able to construct state institutions not just within their own borders but in other more disorganised and dangerous countries as well we insist that we are promoting democracy self government and human rights the art of state building will be a key component of national power
2742245 one of the most basic issues is whether democracy is a matter of institutions or of values or some combination of both
2742246 but those two turnovers did occur you have to take everything into account
2742247 its like brett favre trying to make a play he said
2742248 alex moved the ball pretty good but his throws were not as effective nolan said he noted the misfires on smiths first two throws deep over the middle to jason hill and a short toss toward running back thomas clayton
2742249 alex had an opportunity on first down he had an opportunity on second down nolan said referring to two passes from smith that netted 7 yards
2742250 i would like for them to play better than we did last night
2742251 we were looking forward to coming out here today said gilbert who had a hand in several plays that went for negative yards
2742252 we expect a lot weve been working hard all summer together and everything is coming together
2742253 were right where were supposed to be right now were trying to take care of business
2742254 we did good but there is room for improvement owens said we gave our offense a legit look i dont think they are going to see a defense like ours in conference but its only a start

2742273 mark thatcher stated to nazarbayev that his family his mother and himself would be delighted to help him with his image internationally
2742274 no money was discussed with nazarbayev as it would not have been considered elegant but the next day thatcher agreed a deal with ar oil and the first payment of 150 000 was made to his account in new york
2742275 the money was for him to represent not just the company but also the country it was to keep him sweet
2742276 as well as being a personal friend of my family i have enjoyed a business relationship with assan and ar oil for the past five sic years during which time our business has grown from a small consulting agreement into a wider and more sophisticated arrangement

2742278 no diet will remove all the fat from your body because the brain is entirely fat without a brain you might look good but all you could do is run for public office
2742279 the devil has put a penalty on all things we enjoy in life either we suffer in health or we suffer in soul or we get fat

2742304 im not quite sure what all the stephen ireland rumour is about
2742305 there was a bit of confusion about stephen before the game against milan but i had a word with him before the game and explained my interpretation of it
2742306 its been sorted out and i explained my understanding of it
2742307 at this time of the year a lot of agents are flying around and at times some are of a view that they can start to exercise some interest in their clients
2742308 anything weve said in regards of stephen has been misinterpreted and people have run away with it
2742309 hes staying absolutely hes staying sunderland has been mentioned but theres been no contact in that respect

2742328 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2742329 i dont think so at all i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2742330 the edwards family indicated they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2742331 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2742332 china is getting ready for the olympics the official motto for the olympics is one world one dream restrictions apply tibet not included
2742333 theres excitement in the air over the olympics also lead arsenic benzene
2742334 beijing skies are so polluted that chinese authorities are planning emergency measures for the olympics for example protesters will now only be run over with hybrid tanks
2742335 now you think im exaggerating but they had a practice today in beijing for the olympics and a javelin thrower threw the javelin up into the air and it stuck
2742336 the government of china announced that it will ban restaurants from serving dog meat during the olympics
2742337 china has announced that during the olympics protesters will be allowed to assemble in designated protest areas yeah or as theyre commonly called in china jails
2742338 china is getting ready for the olympics the skies over beijing are very smoggy the government says the pollution is just a harmless mist the made a similar statement about the treatment of prisoners its not torture its pilates
2742339 everybody going to the olympics is concerned about the air quality in china there is a lot of smog friends over there tell me that the air in china looks like the air in willie nelsons tour bus
2742340 the olympics start the friday after next pollution permitting for some reason theyre having them in beijing which means the chinese government right now is very hard at work trying to cover up all the horrible things about their country its like when your mom comes to visit your dorm room
2742341 the united states olympic bicycle team got off the plane yesterday wearing air filter masks on their faces theyre the same masks that kids have to wear when they play with chinese made toys
2742342 an ethiopian runner has dropped out of the olympics because he thinks the pollution could damage his health he said the air has made him so sick he can barely not eat
2742343 china has announced that theyre shutting down several of their largest factories for the rest of the summer so that there will be less pollution for the olympics chinese officials say sorry but for the next few months youre going to have to buy your lead coated toys somewhere else
2742344 china is upset because somebody leaked a video of the rehearsal for the olympics opening ceremony on the internet i dont want to give away too much but it ends with the lighting of a torch
2742345 but i think the u s is going to do well particularly in swimming i think we have a very strong swimming time this year for the olympics yeah thats right dick cheney in particular looks great in the freestyle waterboarding
2742346 yesterday president bush gave the u s olympic team a rousing send off to the olympics again i dont think president bush is that up on geography like he told the athletes to get there a couple of days early to acclimate themselves to the fact that china is upside down
2742347 and china says it will ban entertainers they deem a threat to the government from taking part in any activities during the olympics
2742348 and human rights activists have sent a letter to president bush asking him to raise human rights issues with the chinese government during the olympics unfortunately they also sent a letter to the chinese government asking them to bring up human rights issues with president bush so its pretty much a wash
2742349 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

2742351 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2742352 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2742353 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2742354 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2742355 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2742356 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2742357 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2742358 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2742359 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2742360 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2742361 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2742362 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2742363 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2742364 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2742365 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2742366 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2742367 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2742368 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2742369 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2742370 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2742371 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2742372 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2742373 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2742374 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2742375 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2742376 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2742377 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2742378 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2742379 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2742380 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2742381 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2742382 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2742383 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2742384 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2742385 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2742386 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2742387 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2742388 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2742389 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2742390 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2742391 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2742392 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2742393 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2742394 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2742395 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

2742397 im so used to swimming up and down the lane rope
2742398 you dont really get to train going up the middle
2742399 i would like not to have to swim it any more
2742400 its one of the hardest races in my opinion thats my last
2742401 i felt like i could possibly stop in the water
2742402 coming into the race i didnt want to have any regrets
2742403 whatever time and whatever place i did today i would have been proud of
2742404 i dont swim well at the little meets because its just no fun id rather not be there
2742405 when the pressure is on i know that everything ive trained for is coming to this point in time
2742406 all those hard training sessions just know its paying off
2742407 when the pressure is on i know that everything ive trained for is coming to this point in time
2742408 all those hard training sessions just know its paying off
2742409 i think we could get growth numbers in 2009 and 2010 which are under 2 per cent
2742410 i think the 2 25 per cent could be brought down to 1 75 to 2 per cent
2742411 i think the rba will have inflation coming back to 3 per cent sooner and that obviously would justify a potential rate cut in september
2742412 the market has 33 basis points factored in for september
2742413 there has been some talk of them going by 50 basis points so i think the market is toying with that idea at the moment
2742414 we are not ruling out them going by 50 basis points but we cant see the need for that size this time around
2742415 its tricky for the banks but the big unknown is what the banks do and whether they pass on the full benefits of a rate cut
2742416 if they only pass through some of the cut or they are slow in doing so the rba could have to do more
2742417 shes the lucky girl its cool to hear through the grapevine that miley cyrus has my song as her ring tone
2742418 girls a lot of the time smell much better than boys we smell like vanilla we smell like watermelon we smell like strawberries
2742419 one day i was with my boyfriend and i opened a magazine and realized you know what honey i would probably make out with angelina jolie if she wanted to
2742420 it doesnt matter if youre female or male if the right woman walks through the door everybodys jaw is going to be on the floor
2742421 what a sad picture of a lost child swept away by carnal pleasures
2742422 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2742423 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2742424 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2742425 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2742426 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2742427 i dont think its in telstras interest to be seen to be the company thats still trying to implement work choices
2742428 in a democracy people who want to be a member of a union then the union has got the right to represent them and companies right across the country should recognise that
2742429 we simply want everyone who wants an opportunity to be on a performance based contract to have that opportunity
2742430 theres no need to have someone between us and the employee so this is not about awas or unions its really about how a modern company relates to their employees and if people want to work harder they can make more money
2742431 if someone is trying to squeeze the bitter lemon of work choices its not us
2742432 it will certainly say to telstra and to other companies that if a majority of the employees want to try collectively bargaining then the employer has to join them at the bargaining table and have a go at it in good faith
2742433 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2742434 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2742435 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2742436 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2742437 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2742438 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2742439 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

2742442 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2742443 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2742444 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2742445 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2742446 even now i can retrace the first steps i took as a child and be stunned by the beauty of the islands the trembling blue plane of the pacific the moss coloured cliffs the north shores thunderous waves

2742463 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
2742464 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country

2742504 weve made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2742505 we deplore the dangerous and disproportionate actions by russian forces and we would be particularly troubled if these attacks are continuing now as the georgians are pulling back
2742506 very very concerned if in fact there is ground action inside of georgia proper that is outside of these areas of abkhazia and ossetia
2742507 both presidents have the same position and agree across the board but specifically on these three points that there needs to be a ceasefire there needs to be disengagement and there needs to be respect for georgian territorial integrity
2742508 i have no way of knowing whether i was a beneficiary of affirmative action either in my admission to harvard or my initial election to the review
2742509 the gun battle incident that i was referring to gave them rebels a signal that they government are not sincere in the implementation of the ceasefire
2742510 its is not true that the group of umbra kato defied the order in fact they already started complying with the order
2742511 we cannot be accused of not being sincere because we have held on to any countermeasure for quite sometime
2742512 but right now we have yet to see any compliance on the part of kato to abide to whatever agreement that has been set forth
2742513 we are only taking actions against the breakaway milf group that defied the orders of the ceasefire panels
2742514 the current situation on the ground is very fluid and very volatile
2742515 what went on at the hotel in nc must stay in the hotel in nc
2742516 now theyre walking in with 2 3 million they dont know what to do with it
2742517 what are these people going to do with all this money
2742518 ive always wanted one and i wrote them a check for it and that was a good feeling its definitely made me i guess you would call it financially independent
2742519 you get over a million in one night its hard to get used to
2742520 lets get the people out of the mud and the dust in the entire parish

2742532 now im just going to the farm to wait on angus cattle
2742533 shes doing well she had surgery and finished six weeks of chemo and radiation now she has to have an mri done
2742534 we knew it was going to be a tough game but were disappointed with a point
2742535 we knew before the game that we could compete at this level and i think we showed that today
2742536 in the first half there were not enough players up to the right level of performance and thats what cost us
2742537 i had to go in at half time and read the riot act but you shouldnt have to do that in the first game
2742538 i thought owen storey did ok up front getting himself into goal scoring situations a couple of times with that pace
2742539 he has got tremendous pace and probably should have finished but if he keeps getting there i am sure he will do well
2742540 to be fair to lee ayres i felt his nomination as the man of the match was a fair shout
2742541 he never misses a beat never wastes a motion nor fails to deliver a stunning narrative that rises and falls with each execution
2742542 this show should be seen by many it is a difficult subject matter handled well dont miss it
2742543 its about a guy who kills paedophile priests the psychological journey of a man who because of a horrific experience he had as a child in a small town goes on to start killing priests
2742544 at the moment we are looking to do a tour in the spring i am actually going to be speaking to some venue managers over here so that they can see the show and then we will see where we go from there
2742545 people should not be afraid of their government the government should be afraid of its people
2742546 a lot of people in south dakota are saying dykstra hasnt earned it
2742547 the chief executive of the council peter mcnaney and gerry lennon of the belfast visitors and convention centre wanted the former lord mayor to sign off on the logo but he categorically refused they were gobsmacked
2742548 instead of giving his seal of approval councillor rodgers stood up and said hed listened to the views of people from the working groups and it was clear they werent happy he said more work needed to be done
2742549 it was very embarrassing news of what had happened spread like wildfire around the council
2742550 having spoken to the chairman of the referees association david malcolm we have moved on significantly and i can confirm that the referees will resume their duties and the new premiership season will start on saturday
2742551 there will be no more meetings with the referees association concerning money
2742552 they have got what they want its simply regrettable it had to come to this
2742553 i have told david to leave everything in my hands and i will dot the is and cross the ts
2742554 were hoping from september 1 to be starting a pilot scheme for assistant referees running the line and this seems agreeable
2742555 im just annoyed i wasnt involved in these discussions from an earlier stage than thursday
2742556 if i had have been then i would have been confident football would have been played yesterday
2742557 thats why on this embarrassing issue there must be a de briefing i will be ordering an investigation into the matter if a letter came into this association four months ago from the referees what happened during that time
2742558 yes it can be a laborious process at the irish fa but i as president want answers and you can be rest assured this type of thing will never happen again i will not allow it
2742559 however we should not be conducting a blame game rather i would like to think the irish fa as a whole will learn from this
2742560 so much hard work has been put into this league and even though it will now go ahead on saturday everybody had been looking forward to the league starting on august 9
2742561 the senior clubs committee did everything in their power to try and sort out the problem but with no say over the intermediate committee our hands were tied
2742562 the referees knew our position and despite saying we couldnt do any more for them they still went ahead with the strike as they were dealing with the demands collectively
2742563 i want an investigation into this matter and will also be asking for a change so that each tier of football is dealt with seperately we cant have this happening again
2742564 im so so sorry for everybody involved and am absolutely gutted

2742566 theres not words to describe that boy he was very kind and did everything for me he was like the man of the house because me and his dad are divorced
2742567 he would go around the neighbourhood helping people he would sit and listen to people who had depression or people who were alcoholics and help them clean the house
2742568 he would come in and say are you all right mum and give my head a pat
2742569 i told him not to worry about that our last conversation was good i told him how proud i was of him
2742570 maybe he was going to find out if there was a bomb he said ill see you in a minute
2742571 i went into the salad bowl i had tomatoes in my hand and i was giving the boy the money and i thought i think theres a bomb here im getting alan and im getting out of here
2742572 just at that there was an unearthly bang i thought i was dreaming it blew me back to the middle of the shop
2742573 i still had the tomatoes in my hand because once i got outside i saw bits of bodies limbs or something and i dropped the tomatoes with the scare
2742574 as the day went on i began to get really worried i was so worried i couldnt move i was paralysed with fear
2742575 my son pauls dog started howling and i thought alans dead it was the way the dog was howling i thought does he see him
2742576 i heard alan call mum i know that without a doubt i sat up in bed looking for him
2742577 when i went into the bedroom a sense of peace came over me i had an idea he was dead i believe he called me from where he was i had that quite a lot after he died
2742578 it was definitely alans voice people probably think youre crazy but i know what i heard thats always been a comfort for me
2742579 i remember alan every day not every year or 10 years the pain is there
2742580 i have had a really bad spell of depression at the moment this is one of the lowest spells ive had since alan died
2742581 im not sleeping well only about three or four hours a night sometimes ive bad dreams that would wake me theyre about horrible things murder and bad people my minds obviously disturbed
2742582 when i come off anti depressants i cry all the time and take panic attacks
2742583 i think some day i will make a fresh start out of here i would have to think about it very carefully because i would be leaving family
2742584 i dont know what will happen i dont think you can go back in life you have to go forward
2742585 after what they have been through i know they have the courage to do anything
2742586 i met suzanne and michelle and i also met pauline green i spent over five hours with them and their families had private chats with each of the girls and answered any questions they had about their artificial limbs
2742587 i told them how i carried on with my life after losing my leg and how they could enjoy life again as difficult as it may seem after the tragedy of omagh
2742588 i have learned to ski swim and snowboard and only having one real leg hasnt stopped me achieving my dreams
2742589 i counsel hundreds of amputees and their families and a common question is will i be even less attractive to the opposite sex
2742590 i told them it was all about confidence and that was one of the most attractive features in anyone there was no reason for these girls to feel any less attractive than before
2742591 there are a million things out there that they can do well if not better than anyone else
2742592 losing a leg need not be a disability to them
2742593 i told them they could still do anything they used to do and not to let anyone try to change their minds
2742594 i had worked on the frontline in the former yugoslavia and had seen on many occasions families lives torn apart and how the community came together and helped each other heal through time and connection
2742595 it is impossible to celebrate the anniversary of a terrible act of terrorism the courage the people of omagh have shown and the overcoming of adversity however is definitely something to celebrate
2742596 however the lives lost can never be replaced and we pray and hope that some lessons have been learned so their deaths were not in vain
2742597 the critical information they really need is recent sightings that would suggest where madeleine is now

2742619 i want to go back and to stay if we lose south ossetia now it wont be forever because we will never surrender our land
2742620 there is a lot of panic many people have left and i am thinking of joining them my bags are already packed
2742621 we are afraid that the russians will come here and kill us people would not go if we had a strong army but they dont believe in our army any more its a tragedy when a man loses his motherland then hes no longer even a man
2742622 i have left everything i dont even have another shirt if the russians stay then i can never return were afraid of what the russians can do
2742623 we are only waiting now to see what will happen russia could completely occupy georgia now and the west will not do anything to stop them because they are afraid to go against them
2742624 georgia did not attack russia russia is attacking georgia they say they were protecting their citizens but we heard the same argument from nazi germany in taking the sudetenland in 1938 formally russia says it is protecting its citizens but in reality it is beginning a war

2742638 amid the growing visibility of a huge obama campaign under way in this must win state for mccain loyal republicans have been waiting for signs of life on their side whatever theyre doing on the grass roots campaign clearly is not working said republican consultant doug mcalarney of tallahassee
2742639 but with well over 200 full time staffers in florida four times as many as mccain and the republicans and some 150 000 florida volunteers registered online obama is building a democratic campaign machine that could finally challenge the gops mastery of ground game tactics
2742640 he already seemed like a long shot and then this week mccain faced some lousy national publicity and had to return 50 000 of suspicious campaign donations funneled through charlie crists pal and top fundraiser harry sargeant iii of boca raton
2742641 democrats consider republican incumbent tom feeney vulnerable in his campaign to represent the 24th district in the u s house of representatives because of his ties to disgraced lobbyist jack abramoff in 2003 feeney took a trip to scotland with abramoff feeney has reimbursed the federal treasury 5 600 for the trip but justice department investigators have questioned him in the wake of the abramoff scandal add in national sentiment for change because of frustration with the war in iraq along with a stagnant economy and democrats are sensing an opportunity in the republican stronghold covering southeast volusia as well as parts of brevard orange and seminole counties

2742644 here is the plan well figure that part out later yep thats the plan
2742645 assuming a judge doesnt knock it off the nov 4 ballot this week a 9 3 billion to 11 billion tax swap proposal for schools would force the legislature to make some tough decisions
2742646 florida voters this fall could decide on several ballot proposals that blatantly mix and match public wants and political necessities thanks to logrolling by the states powerful tax and budget reform commission voters will be enticed by promises of lower property taxes and more classroom spending to vote for constitutional amendments that also would force higher sales taxes and allow more taxpayer funded school vouchers
2742647 fifteen years ago florida voters who were a little confused tended to vote no
2742648 nowadays it seems floridians are very likely to say yes
2742649 imagine this scenario barack obama wins florida in november and those 27 electoral votes enable him to reach the magic winning number of 270 electoral votes but obama cant actually claim victory because florida democrats neglected to properly elect the 27 presidential electors who ultimately vote for a president

2742651 charles mckenzie 52 a former pinellas teacher and minister has led the state rainbow push coalition and fought for farmworker rights
2742652 the state got by for so long on agriculture tourism and services all of which run mostly on lower wage jobs that dont require an undergraduate degree much less an advanced degree but since 2003 the housing bubble and hurricanes have made florida more expensive and there arent enough higher paying jobs to keep the economy humming this may be the fourth largest state but it has the manufacturing industrial base of a country that sends 10 athletes to the olympics study after study has shown the link between better jobs and better universities

2742696 blood doping reduces fatigue by increasing the supply of oxygen to the exercising muscles
2742697 this will not increase the maximum force the muscle can generate but will permit the muscle to do more work for longer
2742698 people most interested in blood doping would be distance runners from probably 800 meters and up swimmers in the long races cyclists for sure perhaps people in rowing or in the triathlon so those would be the sports that just kind of pop right out
2742699 the amount of improvement would be clearly enough to give you a substantial edge in international competitions if you were an elite athlete
2742700 the difference between endogenous epo and recombinant human epo is not very big
2742701 what carsten has confirmed what people sort of thought was going on is that it would be possible for most people to use low doses of the stuff epo enough to get an edge
2742702 so somebody could cheat on monday and if the drug testers came on wednesday 48 hours might be enough for the stuff to be gone
2742703 some of these compounds have short acting periods of time in the body but the biological effects the positive effects on performance can be weeks or months
2742704 the cheaters are in a constant cat and mouse game with the authorities
2742705 theyre always changing their strategies in an effort to beat the tests
2742706 the fear with blood doping or epo use is that the blood count gets too high the blood gets too thick and it becomes hard for the heart to push the blood around the body or that somehow this high blood count contributes to somebody having a stroke or a blood clot

2742718 i see a new character above all after the riots on may 1 in hamburg
2742719 the black block of neo nazis are attacking left wingers and police officers with an aggression that can be seen as a change in strategy
2742720 before neo nazis largely avoided violence for tactical reasons but this no longer appears to be the case
2742721 weve had a great season so far now lets go finish it off

2742742 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2742743 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2742744 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

2742751 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2742752 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2742753 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2742754 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2742755 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2742756 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2742757 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2742758 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2742759 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2742760 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2742761 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2742762 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2742763 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2742764 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2742765 this is an open military aggression and we are now at the state of undeclared war with russia what else could you call it

2742770 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently under way what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2742771 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of improvised explosive devices and authorising their emplacement across the province
2742772 finding one man intent on remaining hidden within a province measuring more than 22 500 square kilometres is no easy feat
2742773 we hope there will be no more groups seeking asylum in australia and other countries in fact with positive developments in the province of west papua we may witness on the opposite side that those who are already enjoying asylum status return to papua
2742774 we would welcome those who reconsider and wish to return
2742775 we are fully aware of the sensitivity even at the highest level of meetings amongst our ministers this has been quietly discussed
2742776 certainly we take into account the domestic and bilateral implications of this problem
2742777 just take your time because regional integration is an evolving process
2742778 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2742779 nobody ever will defy russian rule in this part of the world
2742780 two thousand killed is it enough for you thirty thousand refugees is that enough for you
2742781 there is almost no way we can imagine a return to the status quo
2742782 we have come to the conclusion that it will be very difficult if not impossible to find common ground on a statement
2742783 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2742784 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2742785 in the telephone intercepts they always were extremely satisfied when someone blew himself up

2742787 when you run the football and get chunks first downs and score on long runs its a good feeling and you can control the game we controlled the game we set out to first and foremost win the ballgame and you know we really controlled the game because of the defensive stand the defense set the tempo we had a defensive score and so we controlled the ballgame
2742788 just from how practice looked were a physical football team thats one of biggest things that coach fisher stresses to us a lot is to always be physical dont take nothing from no one if were going to win win physical if we lose were gonna lose physical
2742789 i just wanted to come in here and see how well i could do in my first nfl game and just have a good game and let the whole organization know that the titans didnt make a mistake on making me a first round pick
2742790 my biggest job was to get vince on the edge but they brought one more than we could handle so i was the outlet it was a good play i was able to get to the sideline and get the first down when i got back to the huddle i could feel the energy and i thought that we were going to have a good drive
2742791 we had a good defensive performance the first three series i think everybody showed up tonight i think everybody was excited to get out there we had the three practices against them so we made sure we didnt go out there and get manhandled tonight defensively i think we did decently
2742792 i thought we looked pretty good were working hard trying to establish ourselves as one of the top three defenses in the league and thats what were going after were going to make mistakes just still getting back into it but well be alright come jacksonville

2742856 the protection of those least able to heat their homes is a priority for the government
2742857 we will continue to work with energy companies amongst others on measures to help the most vulnerable to reduce the amount of energy they use and to lower their bills
2742858 with high fuel prices the coming winter will be difficult for many families and we are committed to supporting them

2742861 the court of appeal has this morning handed down its judgment in the very important and controversial case of allen v gmb lt lt a href
2742862 i recently attended a meeting and heard from unison activists who are being attacked by the leadership of their own union as with other individuals who attended the meeting i am horrified shocked and quite frankly outraged especially when i heard of the detail of the allegations against the individuals concerned i am a unison member myself and i therefore want to go on record as pledging my support to those activists now being witch hunted by a section of the union i want to pledge my support in particular to yunus bakhsh glenn kelly onay kasab tony staunton suzanne muna and brian debus unison members at present are fighting against pay cuts and having to cope with the consequences of inflation they are fighting attacks on their jobs and terms and conditions as well as countering the threat from the bnp while witch hunts should never take place how can the union justify this political attack on long standing trade unionists anti racists and black activists while at the same time there is so much work to do for our members i say a political attack because that is what i believe this to be as i stated at the meeting i attended it is the case that in order for free market policies to flourish for wages to be held back for privatisation to continue unopposed and for workers to be made to pay for the crisis in the economy then it is equally necessary for the organisations of the workers our parties our trade unions to be made impotent one way to do that is to clear out fighters and militants that is what this is unisons leadership are doing the bosses a favour it is a political witch hunt if it is successful then the losers will be ordinary unison members that is how important this campaign against the witch hunt now is that is why i support those being attacked i ask all unison members to do the same and i call on the union leadership to end this witch hunt today i hope that all unison members who believe that our union should be an effective force fighting for our members and not against our activists will unite in a campaign for democracy in our union trade unions belong to their members it is us ordinary members who make up the union our voice should be heard and our views listened to closing down the right of members to have a democratic say in our union by attacking and hounding individual members and manipulating the structures and rules of the union is increasingly undermining the confidence of our members in their union eventually this will damage and undermine the effectiveness and the very existence of our union i believe that all those that want to save our union should stand up now and demand a democratic union

2742906 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2742907 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2742908 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2742925 you can really feel the change the right wing governors wont let him govern
2742926 theyll remain deadlocked and each side will use it to become more deeply entrenched in their positions
2742927 if they ratify us the first thing im going to do is call a meeting with all the authorities who were ratified or new authorities to seek consensus
2742928 the government is a satellite of hugo chavez and wants to impose a constitution that centralizes destroys institutions and the economy
2742929 he translated the pain of the palestinians in a magical way he made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions
2742930 apart from being the poet of the palestinian wound which is hurting all arabs and all honest people in the world he is a master poet
2742931 this great figure whose poetry which reflects nostalgia and liberty speaks to us all
2742932 mahmoud darwish knew how to express the attachment of an entire people to its land and the absolute desire for peace his message which calls for coexistence will continue to resonate and will eventually be heard
2742933 the palestinian question in mahmoud darwishs poetry was no longer a legend but the story of people made of flesh blood and feelings
2742934 the voice of palestinian civilization with its pains sadness and ambitions
2742935 he turned the palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other arab issues
2742936 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun do not let the olive branch fall from my hand
2742937 the measure has been undertaken in response to the georgian military aggression against south ossetia and the immediate danger for abkhazia
2742938 i thought i was going to die it was unbelievable the house shifted the front door its a solid wooden door its in pieces
2742939 we are asking people to take medication take any pets you may have in your home anything that you require for today
2742940 and whoever the next candidate is whether its john mccain or barack obama the next president is i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury
2742941 but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2742942 im going to do everything i can to step up to any problems that are going to face the country but again i look forward to doing other things you know next year
2742943 i believe it is going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all of the housing problems
2742944 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2742945 i think it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are important to our capital markets broadly
2742946 we have a regulatory system that is very outdated it was put in place many years ago
2742947 tonight was just about getting to tomorrow i just wanted to conserve as much as i could and make it into the semi final and hopefully the final
2742948 deeper more sustained and better coordinated engagement on the full range of issues upon which we agree and disagree
2742949 testifies to the importance that the united states now accords to this part of the world
2742950 markedly accelerate their economic reforms and democratic credentials respect human rights and develop vibrant civil societies
2742951 via an east west corridor of cooperation stretching from china and afghanistan across the caucasus to the mediterranean
2742952 uzbekistan has asked for guidance and support in its dealings with the international monetary fund and other international financial organizations kazakhstan needs more foreign investment and support for local private sector development turkmenistan may need support for the development of grass roots organizations kyrgyzstan needs help with its debt burden tajikistan the poorest state in the region and still recovering from civil war and drought will need a broad range of humanitarian economic and political assistance
2742953 we are ready to explore new areas of assistance for all five states but only in exchange for demonstrated concrete steps toward reform
2742954 in what only a decade ago was the soviet union the united states now has thousands of u s military personnel working alongside their central asian counterparts we rely on these governments for the security and well being of our troops and for vital intelligence that has helped us to conduct such an effective military campaign in afghanistan
2742955 are every bit as important as our security assistance in dealing with the long term root causes of terrorism
2742956 i am against zoos but you cant really do anything about it here in egypt you cant close the zoo where are all the animals going to go these animals are not wild animals anymore they have been living in cages all their lives
2742957 usually when animals die we replace them but during this period they didnt replace the important species
2742958 with the budget we have we cant afford any of this it is just for feeding and maintenance
2742959 we do follow up on that and try to encourage and cajole change where change is needed our approach is working for change from within rather than trying to force it from without
2742960 to the last i grapple with thee from hells heart i stab at thee for hates sake i spit my last breath at thee
2742961 death is no freedom from judgement on the contrary he doesnt even have to hear it
2742962 i swam as i have been practicing i was calm during the race and hope to build on todays performance in the semifinal
2742963 i kept the same tempo all the way to the end i think i have to improve my time from the heats to the semis and into the final the level of racing is quite high so its going to be tough
2742964 i just try to conserve everything and make it into the semifinal i try to bank as much rest as i can tonight recover and sleep and try to warm down and get out of here as fast as i can so im not getting so run down
2742965 i was still running off the adrenaline and hyper from this morning
2742966 the 100 back is probably the quickest progressing event in the past year in swimming theres a lot pressure on me but im going to enjoy it as much as possible
2742967 suddenly surfaced and issued the statement that the baby was his he abruptly quit his position with mr edwards and with financial help from a wealthy edwards supporter fred baron packed up his family and went into hiding

2742976 we were trying to cover all options and we were hoping that exactly that would happen
2742977 we did a lead out on the hill on thursday the training day
2742978 i led them out then emma picked up the tempo sharon laws was on her wheel so we had already rehearsed that finish we knew the point at 200 metres to go where we wanted nicole to go we knew at what point the legs would be getting heavy
2742979 we wanted to make sure she laid off coming into the final corner but perhaps not that far
2742980 we were afraid someone might come down in front of her so we told her to keep to the left we knew she would chew them up after that
2742981 the plan was emma would go three kilometres from the turnstiles on the last lap
2742982 as soon as she came into the road she was to attack as hard as she could to put the germans on the defensive it worked emmas attack was fully committed
2742983 nicole could watch and wait because the other riders know what emma can do on her own so they were thinking would she ride away or was she bluffing we felt the germans were the most dangerous and they were put on the defensive one was using up all her energy chasing and trixi worrack their best rider was flapping
2742984 i thought yes we can stay away these girls want to catch guderzo so whatever happens well be going fast there was no decision it was just yes this is the time now
2742985 it was like a working group trying to find out the best case scenarios for getting me to the olympics
2742986 its a team effort but its not just the riders the staff and backup as well
2742987 i had tried the other route racing all season but got to major championships without full energy in the tank so why do the same thing if it had been proven not to work
2742988 but it was a high risk strategy because i was trying it for the first time i stuck to the plan and i believe in it
2742989 la magnificence des jo contraste avec la terreur au tibet
2742990 im here to do this perform dances of beauty and joy and to soak in the majesty of italy i just arrived a few days ago
2742991 ive been living here in roma for a year now this city is magnificent
2742992 ill be right back i need to go ill come back i just need to run around the colosseum
2742993 this is what i do you know i run in circles around the colosseum i need to go right now and run will you be here
2742994 why the heck am i watching at all these chronically self delusional morons who have obviously lined up for days only to get on the audition stage and prove to however many million people watching just what gargantuan assholes they are
2742995 most recently ive become addicted to the latest fx networks series called damages this is a series about all the dirty rotten lowdown stuff that happens when theres a couple billion dollars on the line in a class action lawsuit its absolutely the most compellingly watchable tv series i have seen yet mainly because the storytelling thats going on here is so clever and secondarily because all the stuff it takes to really bring a great story to life is there in spades perfect casting great characters each and everyone of which has a hidden agenda complete ruthlessness theres nothing politically correct or dumbed down going on here your have to be awake and smart to follow and enjoy this show its definitely not for the trailer trash jerry springer maury pauvich crowd and thats the real point here television is so popular that its now possible for intelligent people to be able to enjoy tv as frequently as they like without having their intelligence slapped around by prime time soap operas with plastic characters and stupid story lines this and the availability of just about every important sporting event for certain people like me are the two main advantages of the billion channel universe

2743219 even if a state does not like a ruling of the icj it is in everybodys long term interest that we have an international system governed by the rule of law

2743325 induction of plasma trail tnfr 2 fas ligand and plasma microparticles after human immunodeficiency virus type 1 hiv 1 transmission implications for hiv 1 vaccine design
2743326 release of products of cell death and subsequent immunosuppression following hiv 1 transmission could potentially narrow the window of opportunity during which a vaccine is able to extinguish hiv 1 infection and could place severe constraints on the amount of time available for the immune system to respond to the transmitted virus
2743327 sequential aliquots of plasma range 4 to 30 aliquots collected approximately every 3 days during the time of acute infection with hiv 1
2743328 dynamics of hiv viremia and antibody seroconversion in plasma donors implications for diagnosis and staging of primary hiv infection
2743329 while the average peak hiv 1 vl level was 1 421 628 copies ml the average total mp peak level was 606 881 733 ml thus at the times of maximum vl and mp levels the average number of mps was 427 times larger than the average number of virions
2743330 mps are small membrane bound vesicles that are released from the surface of apoptotic cells by exocytic or budding processes mps which circulate in the blood under many clinical conditions are part of a spectrum of subcellular structures that are released from cells and can be distinguished from exosomes mps have immunomodulatory activities and can promote immune cell death exosomes are also immunologically active can suppress immune responses and have been reported to have been found at elevated levels in cases of chronic hiv 1 infection if elevations in levels of immunosuppressive molecules coupled with early cd4 t cell death occur early following hiv 1 transmission then these events could potentially define a protected time during which hiv 1 is able to replicate while anti hiv 1 t or b cell responses are suppressed
2743331 because of the difficulty in obtaining blood samples representing early acute hiv infection from clinical patients most patients do not come to medical attention until weeks to months after infection we resorted to stored frozen plasma collections from plasma donors who unrelated to donating became infected with hiv and were deferred from further donating as plasma donors donate on average twice a week and every donation is tested for hiv and held for 60 days before release their archived samples provide a unique record of the infection from timepoints before viral exposure until seroconversion and beyond plasma donations 600 800 ml from source plasma donors were routinely collected at approximately twice weekly intervals and stored frozen at 20oc or less
2743332 peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids or with signs or symptoms that frequently precede aids pre aids were grown in vitro with added t cell growth factor and assayed for the expression and release of human t lymphotropic retroviruses htlv
2743333 retroviruses were isolated from a total of 48 subjects including 18 of 21 patients with pre aids three of four clinically normal mothers of juveniles with aids 26 of 72 adult and juvenile patients with aids and from one of 22 normal male homosexual subjects
2743334 these results and those reported elsewhere in this issue suggest that htlv iii may be the primary cause of aids

2743376 the majority race is not as good at identifying minorities as it is its own race this is hard wired in some way that we dont completely understand but the phenomenon should be presented to the jury
2743377 this is not an appropriate area for judges to go into
2743378 yes eyewitness id across races has its issues but is there a rampant problem to the degree that we need to get judges to start telling juries this is the law no

2743402 vero sto scrivendo qualcosa di te tuttavia pi importante delle parole la matita con la quale scrivo vorrei la usassi tu quando sarai cresciuto
2743403 ma uguale a tutte le altre matite che ho visto nella mia vita
2743404 dipende tutto dal modo in cui guardi le cose questa matita possiede cinque qualit se riuscirai a trasporle nellesistenza sarai sempre una persona in pace con il mondo
2743405 prima qualit puoi fare grandi cose ma non devi mai dimenticare che esiste una mano che guida i tuoi passi
2743406 seconda qualit di tanto in tanto devo interrompere la scrittura e usare il temperino unazione che provoca una certa sofferenza alla matita ma alla fine essa risulta pi appuntita ecco perch devi imparare a sopportare alcuni dolori ti faranno diventare un uomo migliore
2743407 terza qualit il tratto della matita ci permette di usare una gomma per cancellare ci che sbagliato correggere unazione o un comportamento non necessariamente qualcosa di negativo anzi importante per riuscire a mantenere la retta via della giustizia
2743408 quarta qualit ci che realmente importante nella matita non il legno o la sua forma esteriore bens la grafite della mina racchiusa in essa dunque presta sempre attenzione a quello che accade dentro di te

2743420 after all it is our heritage that shapes our future
2743421 weve been trying for the last two years to do something with them they seem to think this history belongs to them
2743422 this is our towns history it shouldnt go to the highest bidder
2743423 this is the kind of simple non compliance that has frustrated citizens here for a long time

2743440 its clear that in time the mobile search and advertising market will be substantial
2743441 both programs represent virgin mobiles customer centric view of advertising in search customers will be served sponsored links that are contextual and relevant once theyve entered in a topic
2743442 navigating through pages of wap content or trying to hit websites that arent mobile enabled to find that one thing youre looking for will soon be a thing of the past
2743443 by simply typing in the name of a favorite artist or topic into their wireless handsets customers will immediately pull up results of all related content from both virgin mobile and sites across the web
2743444 frankly today tellme already does more mobile search support than google and yahoo combined
2743445 it used to be that they were competing to get you to turn on the television now the tv may be on but they are competing to keep your attention on the tv as opposed to the computer screen the magazine or the ipod
2743446 the individual does thats where the ultimate consumer power comes from
2743447 the fear a good number of the prospective purchasers who had put 10 down on highbury square apartments might cut and run in the light of plummeting property prices means arsenals garden is suddenly far from rosy
2743448 the board know they are treading financial water until the highbury square revenue starts coming in
2743449 for the club to develop highbury square themselves might not have made sound economic sense in the light of the credit crunch that came along
2743450 the club has massive commercial developments and in fact they now define the nature of their business as being football and property
2743451 the only danger is they might have predicated a few decisions on the premise that highbury square was going to bring in more revenue than it might realise
2743452 not withstanding the fact they have got a huge debt which is manageable as long as they fulfil three criteria
2743453 the criteria are that they play to sell out grounds in the english premier league that they enjoy a successful run in the champions league and that they keep their wage to turnover ration at a healthy level under 60
2743454 if they continue to do that there is a very great difference in going in to debt and trying to buy success through the purchase of players and going into debt to build a new stadium as arsenal has done which triples your matchday income at one fell swoop
2743455 all i would say is that maybe from a marketing point of view they could have made better use of the assets they have
2743456 there is nobody on the board with a marketing or advertising background nobody with experience of working at somewhere like procter amp gamble for example
2743457 i have suggested in my book that there were different ways of handling the stadium naming rights they could have been protected the brand by called the stadium something like the highbury emirates
2743458 but let us not forget it is the third richest football club in the world

2743466 consumers are starting to be mobile information consumers as a result were seeing hardware and services providers cluster around that need providing better ways for consumers to use their devices to get local services and information
2743467 we believe pay per call as a business model will be the primary monetization model for mobile search bringing more advertisers to that environment and serving useful content to consumers
2743468 in recent years the search box has fundamentally changed the way people interact with the internet but we have only just begun to scratch the surface for what search and live internet services can do in the mobile space
2743469 that users will be given statistics on how their creatures fare in other peoples games so for example stats on how many times a user created species has been played by another gamer

2743474 some people in europe under british impetus are beginning to think like hitler
2743475 this is not just a provocation to get the russians upset or to get them into a trap
2743476 eu leaders have stepped up their challenges to russian interests by asserting their prerogative to act inside the former soviet union lisbon treaty or no the apostles of the eu as empire intend to make it the arbiter of relations in east central europe eclipsing the united nations in places where the un or russia under a un mandate has played a role since the 1990s the result is an aggravation of tensions that threaten to pull russias southwest border areas especially the caucasus region into a general escalation of warfare across eurasia
2743477 we are the fighting ground for a new world war
2743478 embodies the nostalgia both for the old european nation state and for a european order organized around the balance of power and non interference in the domestic affairs of other states
2743479 everyone involved with the project is very excited and have high expectations it will be great to give users the chance to buy and sell local vehicles completely free its very exciting to be tying up both online and on air promotion which is something really unique in the market
2743480 im convinced were going to do it its going to take some time but we can do this
2743481 the united states is hugely overinvesting in military tools and underinvesting in diplomatic tools the result is a lopsided foreign policy that antagonizes the rest of the world and is ineffective in tackling many modern problems after all you can t bomb global warming
2743482 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries
2743483 washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
2743484 is seen by pakistanis as having backed musharraf for far too long and in too unqualified a manner just sending american troops in there especially without coordination with pakistan would be a recipe for failure but a genuinely political and military approach might succeed over time
2743485 there are no quick and easy fixes for pakistan but it will have no chance if its civilian leaders its army and the united states do not work together to build more effective democratic governance an economic future and a coordinated plan for routing the taliban and al qaeda
2743486 as sunnah ialah jalan yang ditempuh mencakup di dalamnya berpegang teguh kepada apa yang dilaksanakan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan para khalifahnya yang terpimpin dan lurus berupa itiqad keyakinan perkataan dan perbuatan itulah as sunnah yang sempurna oleh karena itu generasi salaf terdahulu tidak me namakan as sunnah kecuali kepada apa saja yang mencakup ketiga aspek tersebut hal ini diriwayatkan dari imam hasan al bashri wafat th 110 h imam wafat th 157 h dan imam fudhail bin iyadh wafat th 187 h
2743487 perintah untuk berpegang kepada jamaah maksudnya adalah berpegang kepada kebenaran dan mengikutinya meskipun yang melaksanakan sunnah itu sedikit dan yang menyalahinya banyak karena kebenaran itu apa yang dilaksanakan oleh jamaah yang pertama yaitu yang dilaksanakan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan para sahabatnya tanpa melihat kepada orang orang yang menyimpang melakukan kebathilan sesudah mereka
2743488 senantiasa ada segolongan dari ummatku yang selalu menegakkan perintah allah tidak akan mencelakai mereka orang yang tidak menolong mereka dan orang yang menyelisihi mereka sampai datang perintah allah dan mereka tetap di atas yang demikian itu
2743489 islam awalnya asing dan kelak akan kembali asing sebagaimana awalnya maka beruntunglah bagi al ghurabaa orang orang asing
2743490 orang orang yang shalih yang berada di tengah banyaknya orang orang yang jelek orang yang mendurhakai mereka lebih banyak daripada yang mentaati mereka
2743491 yaitu orang orang yang senantiasa memperbaiki ummat di tengah tengah rusaknya manusia
2743492 yaitu orang orang yang memperbaiki sunnahku sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sesudah dirusak oleh manusia
2743493 apabila aku melihat seorang ahli hadits seolah olah aku melihat seorang dari sahabat nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam mudah mudahan allah memberikan ganjaran yang terbaik kepada mereka mereka telah menjaga pokok pokok agama untuk kita dan wajib atas kita berterima kasih atas usaha mereka
2743494 ahlus sunnah yang kami sebutkan itu adalah ahlul haqq sedangkan selain mereka adalah ahlul bidah karena sesungguhnya ahlus sunnah itu adalah para sahabat radhiyallahu anhum dan setiap orang yang mengikuti manhaj mereka dari para tabiin yang terpilih kemudian ash haabul hadits dan yang mengikuti mereka dari ahli fiqih dari setiap generasi sampai pada masa kita ini serta orang orang awam yang mengikuti mereka baik di timur maupun di barat

2743500 if the merger does happen the closure orders for salford and eccles colleges would have to be formally issued by parliament which would further delay the setting up of the new college
2743501 the proposal is a big thing for salford and the government departments need to know what the benefits will be for 14 19 year old students and low skilled adults
2743502 whatever the outcome there will be no disruption to the students we will work with the colleges to determine the most appropriate time for a merger if it goes ahead but in the meantime any delay will not impact on the studying of students
2743503 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2743504 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2743505 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2743506 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2743507 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2743508 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2743510 even if people create greater supplies of environmentally preferable fish and even if there is more demand for it from consumers the seafood supply chain doesnt always cooperate
2743511 well have the resources to support an all out effort at product placement
2743512 seafood is a large industry but its very fragmented informal and artisanal so people have been hesitant from a business standpoint how do you build a business around that
2743513 sea change has begun to change the opinion investors have of fisheries as a place to look for investment
2743514 thats really important because the transition to sustainable methods requires capital

2743724 we need to start focusing on prosecution of domestic violence offenses as a matter of homicide prevention
2743725 incarceration might have an impact but we are having trouble in maine getting the prosecution to happen
2743726 too few women are screened for violence and offered the help and referrals they need
2743727 theres still a sexual assault every two minutes in the united states but the violence against women act has helped focus police prosecutors and judges on the seriousness of the crime
2743728 the progress shows that we need to fully fund the programs because the ones that have been funded are working
2743729 i dont think we can say that violence is declining when the number of people seeking services continues to grow or stay the same
2743730 it could be that the numbers arent being counted right or it could be that women have stopped using the justice system but the experience in the field is not that women are safer
2743731 the national crime victimization survey is not an accurate reflection of what we know about domestic violence prevalence
2743732 more than 7 700 requests for services went unmet in a 24 hour period in 2007 because there simply werent enough resources to help them

2743742 senator mccain continues to be stubbornly committed to the bush administration position of an indefinite military presence in iraq despite the fact that the iraqi government is calling for a timeline despite the fact that the iraqis are sitting on tens of billions in oil surplus while our economy is struggling at home despite the impact on our troops and despite the deteriorating situation in afghanistan
2743743 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
2743744 it will be notional and aspirational dates but it will be based on conditions i know that

2743765 he was fabulous he was a friend i think you have to understand the nature of our business in that its hard to say we had a starting time at bachmans
2743766 we kind of grew up in the business and we played together and worked together our entire lives
2743767 its just a deep tragedy i think everyone is shocked and there is not too much else to add at this point we havent heard all of the details yet but everything that we have heard has been pretty terrible
2743768 they touched a lot of people i think there are a lot of people that are pretty sad today not just here but throughout the country
2743769 i was told that todd was a few steps behind barbara and elisabeth and when the attack happened barbara heard todd

2743774 the key this time is there are a fair number of battleground states that are becoming more diverse and maybe diverse enough to make a difference
2743775 the diversity used to be mainly in pretty safe states like texas california and new york
2743776 but is he generating enough enthusiasm to excite people who lack a formal education and are disproportionately young and not likely to vote
2743777 in many ways demographic differences are the raw material for party politics

2743785 iraqis are combating terrorism with one hand and building a democratic state with the other and this is not an easy job
2743786 we have carried messages to all the countries we visited that iraq is in need of reconstruction in all fields including railways oil electricity bridges and housing
2743787 the anti intellectual legacy hofstadter described has often been used by the political right since at least the mccarthy era to label any complication of the usual pieties of patriotism religion and capitalism as subversive dangerous and un american
2743788 iraq and china are keen to show their cooperation by finalizing an agreement on developing the ahdab oil field
2743789 i heard him say he wants to give it to the ordinary people i think he was referring to gordon brown
2743790 his colleague suggested the extra cash could go to the needy but he replied no a fuel rebate for everybody on child benefit
2743791 the protection of those least able to heat their homes is a priority for the government
2743792 we will continue to work with energy companies amongst others on measures to help the most vulnerable to reduce the amount of energy they use and to lower their bills
2743793 with high fuel prices the coming winter will be difficult for many families and we are committed to supporting them
2743794 the government is continuing to consider the best ways of meeting this challenge
2743795 no decisions on any new measures have yet been taken
2743796 i spoke with kak yesterday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2743797 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kak will only talk about that when they do a deal he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with chelsea
2743798 the offers for kaka are only in the newspapers and they make up stories
2743799 its true that chelsea made a conspicuous offer but i will not say how much it was

2743866 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2743867 we are making progress obviously a lot of meetings with a lot of people right now are happening
2743868 a lot of meetings with sponsors potential sponsors and sitting down internally with the organization as it sits now to figure out what we need to do to take the program to the next level
2743869 i feel good about the progress right now and in the short amount of time that weve been there theres a renewed energy organization from everybody ive talked to that they havent seen in a long time
2743870 that in itself can really help an organization out not only for next year but also for the remainder of this year
2743871 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2743872 i honestly think that last year was my most fond memory of a race here
2743873 it was just a classic battle between jeff and myself jeffs history in the series has obviously spoken for itself but the accomplishments that he has had as a road course driver too are very strong
2743874 having that battle with him and having it come down to the last couple laps like that was a race that ill remember the rest of my life
2743875 mistakes by both cost us the lead at certain points in the race
2743876 obviously last year was the first time we had come here with the new car and we did not know how we had to have it feel in happy hour to have it perfect for the race
2743877 thats what made the race fun was the fact that nobody had a perfect race car
2743878 we never had an opportunity to relax and jeff never had an opportunity to relax we pressured each other to the end a little mistake here or there made a huge difference at the end it was just trying to still run 100 percent but not make mistakes at the same time and minimize the opportunity to have a mistake
2743879 stewart has fond memories of battles with gordon at the glen
2743880 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
2743881 you know its important especially for the first two or three races when everybody is so worried about the points and where youre at it really buys you some sleep and peace of mind at the start of the chase
2743882 from my own experience now it can be different for others but as the season wears on and those final 10 wear on youre really just looking at the total and where its at for whatever reason you forget about the seeding process especially when you leave tracks like talladega and martinsville you have so many other things on your mind that the seeding process is kind of at the bottom of the totem pole even though it is an important factor but you just start worrying about whats ahead and those challenges that you have at the track but hes definitely going to have a margin going into it and the way those guys have been and how good theyve been were all going to have to show up on our game to beat them
2743883 its not what someone knows that can be dangerous but its what they know for sure that just aint so

2743895 but with well over 200 full time staffers in florida four times as many as mccain and the republicans and some 150 000 florida volunteers registered online obama is building a democratic campaign machine that could finally challenge the gops mastery of ground game tactics
2743896 he already seemed like a long shot and then this week mccain faced some lousy national publicity and had to return 50 000 of suspicious campaign donations funneled through charlie crists pal and top fundraiser harry sargeant iii of boca raton
2743897 democrats consider republican incumbent tom feeney vulnerable in his campaign to represent the 24th district in the u s house of representatives because of his ties to disgraced lobbyist jack abramoff in 2003 feeney took a trip to scotland with abramoff feeney has reimbursed the federal treasury 5 600 for the trip but justice department investigators have questioned him in the wake of the abramoff scandal add in national sentiment for change because of frustration with the war in iraq along with a stagnant economy and democrats are sensing an opportunity in the republican stronghold covering southeast volusia as well as parts of brevard orange and seminole counties
2743898 floridas budget picture has worsened every quarter of this year friday less than seven weeks into the states fiscal year state economists are expected to announce a pending deficit in the hundreds of millions of dollars that leaves gov charlie crist with difficult choices
2743899 jeb bush and his amen chorus of goose stepping legislators
2743900 here is the plan well figure that part out later yep thats the plan
2743901 assuming a judge doesnt knock it off the nov 4 ballot this week a 9 3 billion to 11 billion tax swap proposal for schools would force the legislature to make some tough decisions
2743902 florida voters this fall could decide on several ballot proposals that blatantly mix and match public wants and political necessities thanks to logrolling by the states powerful tax and budget reform commission voters will be enticed by promises of lower property taxes and more classroom spending to vote for constitutional amendments that also would force higher sales taxes and allow more taxpayer funded school vouchers
2743903 fifteen years ago florida voters who were a little confused tended to vote no
2743904 nowadays it seems floridians are very likely to say yes
2743905 imagine this scenario barack obama wins florida in november and those 27 electoral votes enable him to reach the magic winning number of 270 electoral votes but obama cant actually claim victory because florida democrats neglected to properly elect the 27 presidential electors who ultimately vote for a president
2743906 chief financial officer alex sink told the buzz last week that while she hasnt taken a formal position on constitutional amendment 5 shes leaning against it
2743907 charles mckenzie 52 a former pinellas teacher and minister has led the state rainbow push coalition and fought for farmworker rights
2743908 the state got by for so long on agriculture tourism and services all of which run mostly on lower wage jobs that dont require an undergraduate degree much less an advanced degree but since 2003 the housing bubble and hurricanes have made florida more expensive and there arent enough higher paying jobs to keep the economy humming this may be the fourth largest state but it has the manufacturing industrial base of a country that sends 10 athletes to the olympics study after study has shown the link between better jobs and better universities

2743934 what is the cause what is the reason o lord
2743935 that we find amongst mankind the short lived and long lived the healthy and the diseased the ugly and beautiful those lacking influence and the powerful the poor and the rich the low born and the high born and the ignorant and the wise
2743936 all living beings have actions karma as their own their inheritance their congenital cause their kinsman their refuge it is karma that differentiates beings into low and high states
2743937 depending on this difference in karma appears the differences in the birth of beings high and low base and exalted happy and miserable depending on the difference in karma appears the difference in the individual features of beings as beautiful and ugly high born or low born well built or deformed depending on the difference in karma appears the difference in worldly conditions of beings such as gain and loss and disgrace blame and praise happiness and misery
2743938 whatsoever fortune or misfortune experienced is all due to some previous action
2743939 so then according to this view owing to previous action men will become murderers thieves unchaste liars slanderers covetous malicious and perverts thus for those who fall back on the former deeds as the essential reason there is neither the desire to do nor effort to do nor necessity to do this deed or abstain from this deed
2743940 i declare o bhikkhus that volition is karma having willed one acts by body speech and thought
2743941 be good and you will be happy and we will love you but if you are bad you will be unhappy and we will not love you
2743942 according to the seed thats sown so is the fruit you reap there from doer of good will gather good doer of evil evil reaps down is the seed and thou shalt taste the fruit thereof
2743943 so you buddhists too administer capitalistic opium to the people saying
2743944 if anyone says that a man or woman must reap in this life according to his present deeds in that case there is no religious life nor is an opportunity afforded for the entire extinction of sorrow but if anyone says that what a man or woman reaps in this and future lives accords with his or her deeds present and past in that case there is a religious life and an opportunity is afforded for the entire extinction of a sorrow
2743945 not in the sky nor in mid ocean or entering a mountain cave is found that place on earth where one may escape from the consequences of an evil deed
2743946 no doer is there who does the deed nor is there one who feels the fruit constituent parts alone roll on this indeed is right discernment

2743948 she got in by climbing over a fence and her husband was waiting for her

2743956 if you were to compare a school nurse from 40 years ago she was someone who usually waited for a student who needed a band aid
2743957 we welcome those kids we want them to come to school and they have that right
2743958 but today school nurses are managing kids who need pharmaceuticals children with cardiac problems cancer kidney treatments
2743959 teachers have been told in the past that they would have to do certain things at one point the district wanted teachers to give shots our nurses were up in arms
2743960 not only is the california department of education breaking state law with this directive by violating the established scope of nursing practice but by negating the need for licensed nurses to administer insulin they are placing the children at risk
2743961 we have a certain degree of student population that are at risk and they have a right to have a medical professional to be there for their needs
2743962 were all very concerned about access to health care in the federal government
2743963 when kids come to school and theyve never had a checkup they come with a lot of health problems and its a real challenge
2743964 that to me is a challenge because how do we meet those needs of those in early education
2743965 through early detection we can see if a child needs a pair of glasses or has an ear infection if we just had a nurse in every school we would be available to follow up with these children
2743966 for his invention and development of particle detectors in particular the

2744004 ive been talking to them and theyve been very supportive this week just as they have throughout my career i just called them and it sounded like they had half the village in the house
2744005 before the race we had a plan but our plan went back more than 12 months in terms of what we were going to do
2744006 we sat down with the british coaches and went over all the scenarios for the race sharon emma and i knew our best strength was to ride as a team

2744011 he never really had any kind of focus until he got involved with supermoto
2744012 he really really really enjoyed what he did he stayed in my room last night and we stayed up until four oclock in the morning just talking about life and racing he had a lot of ambition and a lot of goals

2744053 i think we all make mistakes because none of us are perfect
2744054 we all have made mistakes in our past and im sure we will continue to make mistakes in our futures however if we can get in touch with the spiritual side of our humaness and engage in a daily moral inventory i am sure our mistakes will become less and less injurious to ourselves and others
2744055 i was actually dissapointed when the people of detroit reelected kwami

2744057 i think he or anyone for that matter who violated bond conditions deserve to go to jail the judge did what is called for in this age of high technology communications the mayor could still have presented himself in the canada meeting via video conferencing and thus not violating his bond conditions

2744093 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march 2007
2744094 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2744095 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue

2744101 el vaso de leche es a veces un problema en todo el pa s por el car cter pol tico que se le da

2744111 ive worked hard over the last ten years to get the chance to show what i can do on a higher stage
2744112 es nuestro deber hacer esto y permaneceremos aqu el tiempo que sea necesario
2744113 estamos rezando por nuestros soldados y queremos donar sangre como muestra de solidaridad de esta forma les damos ayuda espiritual y f sica
2744114 tenemos miedo de que los bombardeos se extiendan por toda georgia no s lo en osetia del sur y abjasia
2744115 ya hemos tenido anteriormente problemas en esta ciudad y tenemos la capacidad de recuperarnos pero siempre dese que esto no volviera a suceder lo que m s me aterra es no poder contactar con mi familia fuera de tiflis porque sus tel fonos m viles no funcionan

2744122 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work
2744123 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity

2744136 john just isnt the same as he used to be hes not his own man
2744137 a lot of that has to do with how hes wanted this job so bad for so long that hes tied himself to president bush
2744138 he should have been talking about veterans issues not his opponent
2744139 some elements and parties have used the national highway as a weapon to further their interests we will not be deterred by this we are determined to take our trucks through pok
2744140 politicians are doing this for their gain why are poor farmers harassed for this what will we do if our produce rots here
2744141 how can we trust them after the violence there this is something that did not happen even during the darkest days of militancy those days we did not have fertilisers and when there were other problems we have never had to stop the supply of our produce now this has happened
2744142 i tried to find my mom but i couldnt find her
2744143 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
2744144 this is a true testament to the importance you place on relations with china
2744145 there are five stars arising out of the stormy sea each is a lamp to guide our way a lamp for all to see reach out for the stars above savour freedom truth and love there are five stars arising out of the stormy sea

2744147 i hereby confirm that the moskva and the smetlivy have come into the port of novorossiisk
2744148 western countries behaved strangely in the first hours of aggression towards south ossetia they were silent
2744149 this raises very serious questions about sincerity and their attitude towards our country and will of course be taken into account in the future when we hold talks and talk about global issues
2744150 our position is of course negative it will of course be expressed when our minister sergei lavrov speaks on the phone with secretary of state condoleezza rice
2744151 western media is a well organized machine which is showing only those pictures which fit in well with their thoughts we find it very difficult to squeeze our opinion in the pages of their newspapers
2744152 just as it was 20 30 years ago it remains the same today objectivity is not a typical trait of some western journalists and television channels
2744153 the objectivity of the latest meetings of the security council is not at its best but the un is the only organization of universal scale its role is rising
2744154 were going to take diversity onscreen and off screen far more seriously than we have

2744159 i did not realise this could happen to you and i only hope other people learn from my mistake

2744164 the united states did not have knowledge of her whereabouts until she was detained by the afghan police on july 17
2744165 ms siddiqui was not in custody of the united states either at bagram air base in afghanistan or anywhere else at any time prior to her detention on july 17
2744166 any rumors or allegations to the contrary are absolutely baseless and without any credible foundation whatsoever
2744167 this is the first time i put on pads since the giants game
2744168 the next day theres a hall of famer in our locker room
2744169 it was a good touchdown for us and we got off to a good start
2744170 my freshman year i was thinking about track and the olympics
2744171 but it came down to do i want to focus on track or do i want to play football i really couldnt achieve at a high level in both because they are two very different things to prepare for
2744172 but i know some of the guys i was competing against back in college are on the olympic team now
2744173 youve got to get in two different shapes and thats really hard do to in football you cant push things with your legs youve got to be bigger and stronger down there because of the punishment
2744174 football was what i wanted to do track was fun but even back to high school it was football where i saw my future
2744175 if you trip the entire community falls with you but if you triumph it is considered everyones success
2744176 suddenly a 12 year old has become the symbol of hope for the community and a message to the rest that malays can do it too and not just in singing competitions
2744177 why not me i should study hard i should do my best

2744182 there are more eyes looking over apple products for vulnerabilities
2744183 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2744184 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2744185 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2744186 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2744187 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2744188 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2744189 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised
2744190 adoption of mobile push email calendar and contacts is just beginning to take off
2744191 the new apple iphone 3g will take activesync beyond the large enterprise to the mass market and mailsite is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this opportunity
2744192 the new activesync server in mailsite fusion 9 just works
2744193 by configuring your smartphone with your server name user name and password mailsite fusion works just like an exchange 2007 server
2744194 we are really excited to be able to provide the native integration with apples new iphone
2744195 with the scalability and reliability of mailsite fusion 9 now hosting companies and enterprises can roll out first class support for just about every smartphone in the market
2744196 the response of the children has been wonderful you can ask any child about marcus garvey and he or she will be able to tell you something about his life tell you a saying they will be able to respond positively
2744197 summer art 2008 has to do with the continuation of our mosaic on the theme of garvey family and community when we talk about the theme we introduce the children to the concept of garveyism
2744198 we then take them down to the national gallery and there they look with the help of the educational officer at pictures that feature family and community they then do their own drawings in their sketch books
2744199 the teachers then choose from their drawings what should go on the wall what best represents garvey family and community
2744200 when the children come in they are registered and we tell them what the rules of the programme are which means no cursing no fighting proper clothing among others they must also treat their peers in a similar way as they treat their teachers with respect
2744201 we also provide counselling through counsellors from the jamaica theological college and we have the disputes resolution foundation come in and speak to them about how to settle disputes without fighting
2744202 it is extremely important for them to learn about garvey and his message of self reliance self confidence and positive self identity in these times when so many people continue to bleach their skin it is also important for them to learn about the history of africa because when i asked them what they thought of africa they said jungle disease poverty and misery
2744203 they have no idea that africa has cities and nations that africa was well developed even before europe was developed this gives a sense of self esteem when they hear this and know that black peoples history didnt begin with slavery
2744204 the popularity of the platform along with the high demand for applications gives us an amazing opportunity to connect consumers with content making the search process far easier and immediate than anything that has been available before

2744206 i think it might be some kind of muscle spasm or something
2744207 i couldnt breathe so well see how it feels tomorrow morning

2744209 that guy was tough and that guy yesterday was tough too
2744210 we need that im just glad to get past the sixth inning again
2744211 this is not the club you want to pitch behind
2744212 theyve got some guys that can bang the ball around
2744213 i think it might be some kind of muscle spasm or something i couldnt breathe so well see how it feels tomorrow morning
2744214 id rather put a good pitch in play make one good pitch to a batter and get an out
2744215 sometimes when they swing and miss you have to do three of them
2744216 discourse of consumer sovereignty masquerading as a discourse of cultural rights
2744217 identity of original text is not clear disney is an example of

2744219 matrix of the competing social discourses and forces which constitute it
2744220 distinctions between reality and media image while producing new modes of experience and subjectivity

2744240 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2744241 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2744242 finally we start to see his smile not everybody knows that he hadnt played an official game for four months but a talented player like him will retrieve his form very fast

2744251 mein eindruck ist dass sie ein bisschen zu hart war nicht die notwendige lockerheit die sie sonst kennzeichnet ist alles noch m glich von heute auf morgen zu ndern die k rperlichen voraussetzungen sind bestens

2744261 they just shook their heads and said these people have to have their policies reviewed
2744262 in that kind of situation a lifeguard is in the position of overseeing the child the same as a daycare worker it may have upset the parents but you have the lifeguard doing a very important duty and they err on the side of caution
2744263 there is a problem with the way they conducted themselves theyre lifeguards theyre not trained in psychology
2744264 we have no problem with them saying theyd like to investigate further but wed like to have a professional come in

2744275 weighed the relative necessity of judicial branch expenditures against those in the executive branch
2744276 the court is deeply concerned when such a loss of budgetary support threatens the judiciarys ability to meet its constitutional mandate to administer justice and protect the rights and liberties of all vermonters
2744277 all three branches of government use taxpayers dollars i think that everyone should be involved in the process in terms of achieving the necessary target

2744282 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
2744283 tutti possono farti regali tutti tranne me come lo spieghi
2744284 mi rendo conto che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo
2744285 ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto da finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
2744286 certo che no se fossi allinferno tu non saresti con me
2744287 vuoi per cortesia sforzarti di ascoltare ci che dico mi lasci spiegare quanto sei importante per me
2744288 invece voglio farlo come si deve per favore per favore ricordati che mi hai gi detto di si e non rovinare tutto
2744289 prometto di amarti per sempre ogni singolo giorno per leternit mi vuoi sposare
2744290 tu sei beh non esattamente lamore della mia vita perch mi aspetto di amarti molto pi a lungo sei lamore della mia esistenza
2744291 secondo la tradizione tu dovresti sostenere la mia posizione e io la tua
2744292 sai jacob se non fosse che siamo nemici giurati e che ti piacerebbe rubarmi la mia unica ragione di vita penso che mi andresti a genio
2744293 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui lt 3
2744294 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
2744295 vedi ogni persona ha un suo odore un essenza particolare se chiudessi un alcolizzato in una stanza piena di lattine di birra sgasata le berrebbe senza badarci se invece fosse un alcolista pentito se decidesse di non berle potrebbe riuscirci facilmente ora se poniamo nella stanza un solo bicchiere di liquore invecchiato cento anni il cognac migliore il pi raro di tutti che diffonde ovunque il suo profumo come credi che si comporterebbe il nostro alcolizzato restammo zitti guardandoci negli occhi cercando di leggerci nel pensiero a vicenda fu lui a riprendere il discorso forse non la metafora migliore forse rifiutare il cognac sarebbe facile forse dovrei trasformare il nostro alcolista in un eroinomane cio vorresti dirmi che sono la tua qualit preferita di eroina dissi nel tentativo di alleggerire latmosfera sorrise allistante sembrava apprezzare lo sforzo ecco tu sei esattamente la mia qualit preferita di eroina lt 3
2744296 sembrava esitante ma non in maniera normale non come un uomo che sta per baciare una donna incerto della reazione e della risposta di lei che volesse prolungare quellistante il momento perfetto dellattesa impaziente che spesso meglio del bacio stesso
2744297 bella fino a questo momento il mio sforzo personale nel tentativo di salvarti la vita stato enorme non permetter certo che tu ti metta al volante nel momento in cui non riesci nemmeno a camminare in linea retta oltretutto gli amici non lasciano guidare chi ha bevuto lo sai sorrise della sua battuta sentivo laroma dolce e irresistibile irradiato dal suo petto pensi che sia ubriaca chiesi sei intossicata dalla mia presenza riecco quel ghigno malizioso non ti posso dare torto lt 3
2744298 ti amo dissi e la mia voce era profonda e decisa ti amer sempre succeda quel che succeda
2744299 non la fine linizio e la luce dellalba lt 3
2744300 mi dispiace che ci sia stato un fraintendimento ma bella occupata stasera
2744301 anzi per la verit occupata tutte le sere per chiunque escluso il sottoscritto senza offesa spiacente se la tua serata non andr come speravi lt 3
2744302 correre per me n gesto automatico non qualcosa a cui devo stare attento
2744303 fortunatamente tanya ha capito che si tratta di unemergenza e non ha mantenuto un broncio troppo marcato dopo il tuo due di picche
2744304 ed scusami non mi sento grado di avvicinarmi tanto a del sangue umano diventerei io per prima la causa della morte di quel pover uomo scusami davvero
2744305 tranquilla troveremo lo stesso il modo di farcela non ti senti in grado di stare vicino a quel uomo nemmeno trattenendo il fiato
2744306 non ti preoccupare alice prover a fare il possibile aspettami qui
2744307 ti prometto che riuscir a fermare jasper sorella e se non ce la far riuscir a metter rimedio alla situazione
2744308 edward pensai si sta dirigendo verso il pacifico del nord dobbiamo raggiungerlo in tempo non ha preso nessuna scelta per il futuro ma meglio non rischiare
2744309 and so the lion fell in love with the lamb
2744310 voglio affogare dio ti prego se esisti f in modo che io anneghi qui in questo preciso momento
2744311 lo troveremo alice fosse lultima cosa che faccio te lo prometto lo faremo tornare con noi
2744312 and so the lion fell in love with the lamb
2744313 edward non funziona adesso e non funzioner mai rassegnati in questi momenti mi basta la vicinanza di mio fratello a rassicurarmi non ce bisogno di queste cavolate davvero
2744314 and so the lion fell in love with the lamb
2744315 peggio di cos difficile che mi possa andare per oggi
2744316 insomma ti decidi o no ad entrare vuoi stare a gridare ancora stupide riflessioni prima di agire ragazzo carisma
2744317 allora biondino sei abbastanza confuso da meritare una spiegazione purtroppo aggiunse con una smorfia i divertimenti finiscono sempre troppo presto sarei rimasta volentieri ore a confondere le tue idee
2744318 molto meno squallido spiegare tutto piuttosto che trarre divertimento da questo insulso fuori programma guarda un po lunico divertimento che posso avere in questo posto accontentarmi di confondere la gente
2744319 il nord ha i suoi vantaggi ma non puoi andare a caccia di moby dick sui ghiacciai ma devi seguire la scia del suo sfiatatoio in mare
2744320 ah ah ah ah rise con gusto ti ho confuso di nuovo
2744321 immagino tu voglia sapere un po pi di me visto che diventerai mio inquilino sorrise e poi continu tranquilla allora ti ho gi detto come mi chiamo e sono nata in persia nel 1815 mio padre era un marinaio e mi ha insegnato il mestiere perch costituivo da sola la sua prole mia madre era di nobile origine italiana per era figlia illegittima sono stata trasformata nel 1832 mentre ero in viaggio nel mediterraneo provavo a raggiungere litalia per conoscere le mie origini sai la famiglia di mia madre era quella dei capace nobili napoletani cos durante linverno del 1832 mi imbarcai su una nave e provai a raggiungere litalia ma uno degli altri passeggeri era un vampiro e una notte quando mi ferii ad una mano con la mia spilla quel vampiro non resistette al sangue e mi morse tutti corsero in mio aiuto ma quel mostro li uccise e ne bevette il sangue di buono fu che mi lasci stare dopo avermi morsa ma decise di distruggere la nave e spargere la voce di un naufragio tutti credettero alla storia e io rimasi a galleggiare aggrappata ad un pezzo di legno per quattro giorni con i dolori della trasformazione che mi intorpidivano gli arti con i quali mi aggrappavo al rottame di legno il quarto giorno era come se non provassi dolore pensai di essere l l per morire e mi lasciai andare ma dopo alcune ore quando ripresi lucidit mi scoprii su una spiaggia della costa campana e capii che non ero la stessa ero cambiata ero anche io un vampiro promisi a me stessa che non avrei inflitto sofferenze come il bastardo che mi aveva aggredita sulla nave decisi che lavrei trovato e lavrei ucciso con le mie stesse mani cos da allora vado a caccia del mio aggressore di cui ricordo il nome e mi cibo solo quando necessario e stando attenta a succhiare fino allultima goccia di sangue
2744322 si lo so chi sei jasper so la tua storia da dove vieni e cosa hai fatto
2744323 and so the lion fell in love with the lamb

2744339 you have to be aware that not all of the cuts have come into play yet
2744340 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2744341 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2744342 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2744343 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2744344 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2744345 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2744346 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2744347 on the other hand airports are very dependent on the airlines bringing passengers
2744348 people were falling out of their chairs and people were on top of them
2744349 i get sick to my stomach by all the carnage accidents will happen thats why you need to design a vehicle that withstands a crash

2744356 i just had a couple of shoulder surgeries and elbow surgeries and missed some time and broke a bone in my foot in 06 and last year i was in the bullpen i never really got the opportunity
2744357 i think we established the fastball early and kind of pounded the strike zone
2744358 they got aggressive there in the later innings and we started throwing some breaking balls and got some first pitch ground balls and pop ups there to help things out
2744359 not only pitching seven solid innings but getting a base hit and scoring a big run for us as well and using his legs to score a run big performance by him and good job by the bullpen to pull it out at the end
2744360 our law enforcement agencies and government authorities should stop causing nightmares for business
2744361 we need to create a normal investment climate in our country

2744367 there is nothing more deceptive than a smile and no one knows this better than people who hide behind them some flash their teeth as a polite warning to their enemies some put on beaming faces to keep their tears from falling others wear silly grins to mask their fears but then there is that real smile which is actually genuine its the smile of the person who knows his troubles will soon be over
2744368 all children love games but children grow up and then they find new games to play
2744369 ive been told the club want me but then when i went to talk about a contract they arent interested so ive been left confused

2744376 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2744377 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2744378 you know what i find interesting men by far exist in a privileged position in this world and yet they are assigned responsibility for very little women who exist as marginalized bodies with limited access to power are to blame for everything does anyone not see something slightly off about this way of ordering society power with out responsibility would never be deemed acceptable in the business world where money is at risk but when it comes to our social discourse we blindly give men a free pass without forcing them to own any of their privileges
2744379 is benjamin claiming that women who werent prostitutes any longer deserved to be left alone because they were trying to clean up their act but those who were still working in the sex industry shouldnt have been spared the attention i would say all of her former employees should have been excluded from the humiliating spectacle regardless of what theyre doing with their life at present
2744380 want to fight oppression of women then fight by ending oppression not by making enemies of those who are not enemies forget the apostasy forget the heresy just deal with the fucking real world issues like hiv prevention educating against sexual violence
2744381 many of us simply just act as if we and our blogs are media
2744382 let the books speak for themselves if you dont want your kid to read a book because of the authors post publication actions then dont buy it but you should get to decide what is suitable for your child not the publisher
2744383 the industry needs an overhaul sexist stereotypical misogynistic portrayals of women abound in video games but guess what that isnt the fault of girl gamers thats the fault of a boys club industry which needs a short sharp kick to the behind meanwhile we will keep playing the good games and enjoying them too
2744384 like most 20 somethings ive had online pornography and unregulated chat rooms at my fingertips since i hit puberty but i also grew up during the girl grrrl power explosion which taught me to demand respect and play handball and later hardball with the boys and it taught me that i didnt need to cake myself in makeup or teeter along in foot disfiguring heels unless of course i wanted to

2744415 in his case the heart and the sensitivity were completely intact and set in order and because they were intact they were extremely delicate he experienced therefore all our joys and all our sorrows he experienced them just as we do but with a delicateness of one whose sensitivity had not been blunted and who responded immediately and without loss to the impressions made on him

2744479 compliance with a particular law presupposes a particular kind of civilization once that civilization morphs into something new old laws fall into disuse in short cultural mores dictate which laws pass and are obeyed and which laws are defeated or ignored there is a tendency on the part of many to overstate the importance of politics in shaping culture

2744499 the christian man finds in the bible the very word of god let it not be said that dependence on a book is a dead or an artificial thing the reformation of the sixteenth century was founded upon the authority of the bible yet it set the world aflame dependence upon a word of man would be slavish but dependence upon gods word is life dark and gloomy would be the world if we were left to our own devices and had no blessed word of god the bible to the christian is not a burdensome law but the very magna charta of christian liberty it is no wonder then that liberalism is totally different from christianity for the foundation is different christianity is founded upon the bible it bases upon the bible both its thinking and its life liberalism on the other hand is founded upon the shifting emotions of sinful men

2744516 there is a lot of potential for blight in existing centres but we made some significant changes in policy to allow retailers to redevelop existing centres
2744517 as long as we as shoppers keep using these malls theyll keep building them

2744559 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2744560 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2744561 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2744562 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2744563 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president

2744569 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2744570 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2744571 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2744572 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2744573 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2744574 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2744575 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2744576 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2744577 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
2744578 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
2744579 we need help to save our communities and businesses and above all else we want water to save our river and environment
2744580 all we want is our political leaders to have the fortitude the will to release some of it to save the lower lakes
2744581 all it will do is buy a little bit of time before the same problem recurs
2744582 the recent council of australian governments agreement did not aim to fix it quickly it simply put off the decisions until 2018
2744583 ultimately what has to be provided is an environmental flow an allocation of water that is available for the environment every year not just in dire straits
2744584 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province
2744585 we need to go to the facilities where these devices are constructed you could call them ied factories and we need to go after the people who are putting them together and thats precisely what weve been doing
2744586 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently under way what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2744587 yet another example of the good work theyre doing in oruzgan
2744588 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2744589 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2744590 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2744593 she just loved it and if there was a pool or people were in the pool her little legs would just go
2744594 she just really wanted to get into the water she always just loved it
2744595 when stephanie won the gold medal at the commonwealth games her mum said have you opened that bottle of french champagne yet and i said no no no shes got the olympics to go yet
2744596 i really hated the 400im but bohley kept saying this is the event you could win at the olympics
2744597 she was really determined at that age that was what she wanted to do so the family my husband allan hickey myself and stephanies father warren we had to re look at everything because of the financial coast and we had to make some decisions to try to minimise some of the money
2744598 she was at a private school with hideous school fees every year and then you had the swimming costs plus travel costs associated with getting them to these competitions we told her we had to consider a different school and that it was really up to her
2744599 lets just put it this way shes the girl with the million dollar smile
2744600 you only have to look at the likes of duncan armstrong who won gold in the mens 200m freestyle 20 years ago and hes still on the tv commentating
2744601 then theres raelene boyle doing the commentary on track and field for channel seven so shes still earning money 40 years after her first olympic medal she won silver in mexico in 68
2744602 the fact thats shes now won an olympic medal and she didnt just win it either she smashed the world record shell have that for the rest of her life
2744603 from a profile point of view it has established her now shell always be an olympic gold medallist and its only just the start of the games so well just have to see how the rest of it goes
2744604 obviously thats going to be very very lucrative for her long term
2744605 everyone was out of their chairs cheering her on or at least the ones who could stand up
2744606 she is a lovely girl and this hasnt gone to her head shes won numerous medals but this is a really good one shell be happy about this
2744607 i felt confident she would win shes a great fighter and shes in wonderful condition kathryn hoff took this record off her but now shes got it back its great
2744608 i shouldve taken up bowls a bit earlier and i might have been a bit better
2744609 her father taught her to swim and she could swim up and down the pool and youd hardly see a ripple on the water she just had a natural aptitude

2744620 if youre staying alive for me then dont that mommy will be ok well be here
2744621 it was the hardest hardest thing ive ever had to do
2744622 i was doing it and doing it and he came back to me
2744623 god gave me this opportunity and im not going to give up
2744624 they told me you need to make a choice you cant always bring him back why are you trying so hard youre putting him through all this and hes still the same
2744625 hes actually gone through a lot of milestones that they didnt believe he would go through
2744626 hes more mellow not so edgy not in so much pain
2744627 ik ben niet getrouwd omdat mijn schoonouders geen kinderen konden krijgen
2744628 ik ben niet getrouwd omdat de voor mij verkeerde spermatozo n in mijn schoonmoeders eicel terecht kwam
2744629 die verkeerde werd trouwens nog steeds een meisje hoor alleen als die andere spermatozo n net iets sneller was geweest was daar iemand uitgekomen waar ik wel verliefd op was geworden en zij op mij

2744631 the very purpose of these attacks is all about separating the region from china
2744632 want to use the olympic stage to enlarge the impact
2744633 i heard some bombs and then i heard some machine guns
2744634 we came down to the lobby this morning and it was breakfast as usual
2744635 this doesnt usually happen its happening now because of the olympics but i dont know who is doing it
2744636 crazy always crazy he was like batman before there was batman always going into different roles
2744637 hey lama how bout a little something yknow for the effort
2744638 the solution urged by the experts is to abandon passwords and to move to a fundamentally different model one in which humans play little or no part in logging on instead machines have a cryptographically encoded conversation to establish both parties authenticity using digital keys that we as users have no need to see in short we need a log on system that relies on cryptography not mnemonics as users we would replace passwords with so called information cards icons on our screen that we select with a click to log on to a web site the click starts a handshake between machines that relies on hard to crack cryptographic code the necessary software for creating information cards is on only about 20 percent of pcs though thats up from 10 percent a year ago windows vista machines are equipped by default but windows xp mac and linux machines require downloads
2744639 we wont make much progress on information cards in the near future however because of wasted energy and attention devoted to a large distraction the openid initiative

2744651 you have to think about how you posted it a blank cd case originally hmm a retail box with the price on it
2744652 and now in the case with no price on it
2744653 you are when you are pretty new to the forum with activity and involvement
2744654 many of us will hold our opinion and believe it until proven otherwise i myself se eno proff just more suspicion
2744655 there are ndas that prevent us from talking about new and upcoming cards but as you can guess developments are constant and nvidia is no slouch perhaps i can answer some questions about the fully available gtx 200 line that i would suggest you look into the price perfomance support of nvidias and especially evgas lineup cannot be beat
2744656 wow if larc had gotten heavier instead of lighter this is how theyd sound
2744657 i know i have a lot to do to make up for this small score
2744658 i should have done a lot better but im confident that next week ill be standing on the rostrum at dundrod
2744659 but i showed i could lap faster than anyone and i give myself a great chance on saturday i won the senior tt in june and this was nearly enough to set me up for the season
2744660 my grandfather was involved in the bookmaking firm many years ago
2744661 he then moved to cumbria and thats when my father came on the scene and of course i followed on
2744662 it would give me a great thrill to win the superbike race at the ulster grand prix for i have never done so perhaps this will be my year
2744663 people talk about this turnaround and offer all kinds of reasons
2744664 but the reality is that weve had five one point games
2744665 people will say that a division one or two side shouldnt lose to a team from division four but i really dont believe wicklow ever got the credit they deserved
2744666 its par for the course and only right because you are judged on your ability to win a competitive environment
2744667 i am more than pleased with it that was my first 2k since the injury two months ago i was in hospital now i feel there is more to come in this regatta
2744668 my knee felt very good i didnt feel any pings during the race and i am looking forward now to the quarter finals
2744669 i took a more conservative race than usual i would usually have blasted a bit further from the start but the boys pushed me hard throughout i am more than pleased
2744670 every race we are going to step it up a little bit more and a little bit more fingers crossed toes crossed everything crossed that we can have a nice clean run through to the semi finals now
2744671 i think it will be a cracking contest given some decent weather and i think we can come away with a win
2744672 even before last winters signings of regan west and opening bowler john costain i said that along with north down csni were the best and most competitive side we play against so i fully expected to go into this season and be severely pushed by them
2744673 i try to look at the two sides objectively and i think they are pretty evenly matched csni have perhaps more fire power in their batting whereas we perhaps have more depth and the bowling sides compare pretty well
2744674 we will be going into the final on the back of a very good run so there will be no shortage of confidence
2744675 we employ the take every game as it comes approach and so far thats worked well we will talk through our tactics working out our strategy to cope with either batting first or fielding
2744676 it was difficult to accept for about two or three weeks after the season had concluded but during that time i was able to spend time with my family and that opened my eyes
2744677 ive two young boys and they dont know or care whats going on at a football club
2744678 and that really put it into perspective for me there was no point me being down and feeling the world was against me i have two children who are fit and healthy and i realised during that time off when i was with them that i should be very thankful
2744679 therefore after a short break i was itching to get started again
2744680 ive signed a new contract in june so ill be with birmingham for at least another two years now the target is to make sure that during the second year of that new contract im playing with blues in the premiership again
2744681 the championship is such an open league i would say that any one of 12 teams could see themselves promoted at the end of the season
2744682 its without doubt the most competitive league i will have ever played in
2744683 we are obviously one of the favourites to go up and there will be extra pressure placed upon us seeing as weve only come down but i believe we can handle that
2744684 its certainly not going to be easy and were all aware of that but we have the hunger desire and more importantly quality to return to the premier league
2744685 last year is a case in point where you could really never have envisaged that stoke city and hull city would be the two teams promoted alongside west brom
2744686 it just goes to show you that no side is likely to run away with it every side will beat each other and so many teams have a genuine chance of going up
2744687 fiquei muito feliz ao acertar a s rie queria isso para ajudar a equipe e para estar na final tamb m
2744688 its a miracle that these yankees have not turned into the orioles while having to play under those conditions

2744691 its a miracle that these yankees have not turned into the orioles while having to play under those conditions
2744692 even if you do have a rotation of doctors willing to come and keep the er open from now till the end of the year we wont do it
2744693 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community
2744694 we have a number of businesses that depend on good air service
2744695 its going to be much harder for us to convince a high tech company that they should come here it hurts
2744696 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about
2744697 the more you raise fees the more you drive airlines and customers away
2744698 its rhetoric ive heard for 41 years but i understand
2744699 these folks arent sure if theyre going to be in business in six months
2744700 on the other hand airports are very dependent on the airlines bringing passengers

2744716 commodity prices have declined since june and therefore theres no way those kind of trade numbers are going to persist
2744717 it probably will at the end of the day add a little more weight to the market arguments that the bank of canada is going to be cutting rates sooner rather than later
2744718 the economy is going to need all the help it can get in the third quarter with the tax rebate cheques drying up

2744720 you walk by mcdonalds every day in the village smell those fries and being the dedicated athlete you are you keep saying to yourself i will not stop
2744721 confessed the calgary native sunday after sitting in on womens morning qualifying at the national indoor stadium
2744722 it takes a lot of will power burger abstinence but sometimes and dont ask me why you just have to have mcdonalds right you know the feeling we all know the feeling
2744723 so we promised ourselves as a group that after qualifying as a treat wed all go to mc e dees for a team meal
2744724 what did i eat a better question might be what didnt i eat we gorged ourselves it was heaven i had my usual big mac i have one in every place i travel and its true they do taste exactly the same wherever you go wherever you are

2744726 ill sit down and decide what id like to do i want to take time to do things for kyle for a while and not for gymnastics maybe a trip to europe for once id love to see the sights in europe that arent found in airports hotels and gymnasiums
2744727 id like to stay involved in gymnastics in some capacity
2744728 its been such a big part of my life and i absolutely love the sport
2744729 i dont get angry i could be upset with what happened but whats the point okay im weird a bit of a freak but to me frustration just saps the energy out of you
2744730 its like my old coach kelly manjak would say dont let it rent space in your head
2744731 i cant control the judges and i refuse to let them affect my life
2744732 thats something id like to get into in the future i think i could bring a unique perspective to a broadcast its like a painting people look at a painting in a museum and admire it but i can tell them what went into the creating of it i know what its like to be out there having prepared your whole life for that one moment
2744733 maybe it isnt always fair but it is always interesting
2744734 okay i didnt make finals maybe the scores shouldve been higher but potentially i think this olympics could be even bigger for me as a person than the last one when i won a gold medal i know im a stronger individual now than i was in athens or even before my injury
2744735 im not someone who broods or dwells on the negative im always looking ahead to whats out there

2744813 los rusos penetraron en el territorio georgiano y esto es muy real pero yo no creo que el objetivo de los rusos sea destruir completamente las capacidades militares de georgia es una demostraci n rusa para debilitar la capacidad de los georgianos
2744814 la escalada militar es posible pero no estoy segura que sea inevitable porque nadie est realmente interesado rusia no est interesada en una escalada de violencia sencillamente porque hay un c ucaso del sur pero tambi n un c ucaso del norte con riesgo de contagiarse de engranaje

2744832 it has been estimated that 28 percent of our jail population consists of illegal immigrants
2744833 illegal immigrants are responding to changing conditions and leaving the country in significant numbers
2744834 it doesnt seem like america is more unpleasant for immigrants
2744835 we know that illegal aliens are leaving certain states local areas and the nation in much greater numbers and they are leaving as a direct result of more immigration enforcement
2744836 while the economy is certainly a factor media reports from georgia arizona and oklahoma report mass exoduses of illegals from those states and many say they are going back home in reaction to new enforcement measures
2744837 were witnessing a trend of states willing to take the lead in responding to immigration challenges when congress will not

2744853 as i said yesterday im starting to think our threat is not with bos trolls its with those flocking here from the other hillary support groups wanting to be noticed and bring traffic to their sites the good thing about that is they will be gone after august cause im sure battling the dnc will not be exciting enough to keep them here
2744854 we shipped 100 000 square feet of portafloor through our chinese distributor last march but due to some of the secrecy surrounding the opening ceremonies we were never sure until that last moment that it would actually be used

2744873 the fear a good number of the prospective purchasers who had put 10 down on highbury square apartments might cut and run in the light of plummeting property prices means arsenals garden is suddenly far from rosy
2744874 the board know they are treading financial water until the highbury square revenue starts coming in
2744875 for the club to develop highbury square themselves might not have made sound economic sense in the light of the credit crunch that came along
2744876 the club has massive commercial developments and in fact they now define the nature of their business as being football and property
2744877 the only danger is they might have predicated a few decisions on the premise that highbury square was going to bring in more revenue than it might realise
2744878 not withstanding the fact they have got a huge debt which is manageable as long as they fulfil three criteria
2744879 the criteria are that they play to sell out grounds in the english premier league that they enjoy a successful run in the champions league and that they keep their wage to turnover ration at a healthy level under 60
2744880 if they continue to do that there is a very great difference in going in to debt and trying to buy success through the purchase of players and going into debt to build a new stadium as arsenal has done which triples your matchday income at one fell swoop
2744881 all i would say is that maybe from a marketing point of view they could have made better use of the assets they have
2744882 there is nobody on the board with a marketing or advertising background nobody with experience of working at somewhere like procter amp gamble for example
2744883 i have suggested in my book that there were different ways of handling the stadium naming rights they could have been protected the brand by called the stadium something like the highbury emirates
2744884 but let us not forget it is the third richest football club in the world
2744885 edna i have good news and bad news the good news is youre being discharged since you were able to rationally respond to a crisis by jumping in and saving the life of another patient i have concluded that your act displays sound mindedness the bad news is ralph the patient you saved hung himself with his bathrobe belt in the bathroom i am so sorry but hes dead
2744886 web design is the creation of digital environments that facilitate and encourage human activity reflect or adapt to individual voices and content and change gracefully over time while always retaining their identity
2744887 whats the real reason that giving is declining in most churches today is it the economy
2744888 economic downturns do make religious people more conscientious about how and where they give and invest when wages are frozen commissions are smaller and prices are higher the coffers will be lighter thats a fact but the economy has very little to do with the decline in the number of coins that ring in todays coffers even when the economy was booming giving was waning giving has been declining for decades
2744889 a more important question is what motivates generosity at all
2744890 generosity is never tied to your circumstances but to your convictions if the economy had anything to do with giving the macedonians about whom saint paul wrote in sacred scripture had every reason to quarantine the meager resources they did have instead however and this is what shocked saint paul their generosity was outlandish
2744891 just as in macedonia this kind of outlandish generosity exists today
2744892 but it isnt because of sermons on tithing or the pulpit scolding of those who do not give if youre interest is in growing a spiritually healthy church motivation for giving must come from somewhere other than guilt for not giving or shame for giving too little
2744893 you never have to beg from people who have experienced grace
2744894 but you almost always have to beg from those who have not
2744895 if you find there is a decline in giving in your church look for a deficit of grace in peoples lives
2744896 it is there youll find the answers in your search for what motivates giving grace is the key that unlocks the door on the generosity quotient in a persons life

2744900 we noticed some guys acting suspicious so we stopped them
2744901 we stopped them and we asked them for id and one of the guys got nervous and was asking why he said he was a u s citizen
2744902 we made contact with u s marshals and then they passed along the information about the warrant out for his arrest
2744903 this is just the tip of the iceberg on this case
2744904 we hope to recover some more tvs and a lot more criminal cases will be pending

2744908 if that is what you want to talk about then i dont want to talk to you if you print that rot i will sue you
2744909 my one great talent lies in making those who wrong me suffer horribly
2744910 i dont think the british people have ever been broken by anything or anyone i feel there is so much good being done in different parts of our country i think britain is basically a decent compassionate society and most people want to see things change for the better
2744911 a really naive simple guy who doesnt know the first thing about jihad and was just tagging along for the job
2744912 just a poor uneducated guy who needed a job in a country with an overwhelmingly high unemployment rate
2744913 it seems like i dont even feel safe i used to take walks around the neighborhood now im afraid to go out and go for a walk you know because theres so much crime around im afraid to walk
2744914 anytime that you have police officers working in a defined area who know the people know the businesses and frankly who know the bad guys a neighborhood is able to better preserve itself
2744915 we have invested not in buildings but in police officers we have the highest number in our history i think were at 742 right now so i will look at deployment i will look at all the options
2744916 the phone rang four times then he suddenly picked up the phone and answered i was so relieved
2744917 every mass i celebrate i pray for them and it moves my heart it makes me cry even this morning i pray and think about them and i can not stop my tears
2744918 i ask everyone to pray and keep the prayers coming
2744919 finally he was able to locate where she was and tried to shake her up and there was no response
2744920 i dont think you should judge a person until you find out the real facts about whats going on
2744921 its too early for us to look at just one thing
2744922 thats why we have groups looking at the driver the vehicle the roadway all of those issues are important to us usually an accident is not just one thing its a chain of events
2744923 we dont want to blame anybody because we dont have all the details and all the facts yet but we certainly believe that was very irresponsible and we hope its not going to happen to anybody again

2744927 damage to houses from the explosion across the street and we checked out those houses to make sure that there was no one in the houses injured so far we have not found anyone injured seriously injured in those houses
2744928 we have been dealing with propane tankers rail tankers and we have flames impinging on them and thats why we are having a dangerous situation
2744929 they are rail car tanks i believe they have the potential to contain 220 000 litres of propane i dont think theres that much propane in them
2744930 i guess you never know how youll react in a situation like that until it happens but i just went for it
2744931 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2744932 i always wanted to have orgasm during intercourse with him seems like the impossible dream
2744933 mom how unhappy are you about the car you drive
2744934 because you dont drive it you use it maybe 3 times a week to drive to work and the other times it sits in the drive way until you take it out for errands if thats all youre going to do with it id rather sell it you bark about the gas prices and im paying insurance on a 2nd vehicle that doesnt get utilized the way it was intended
2744935 i dont think you did i gave you a list of jobs but you are unwilling to try for them because they arent located in the ciy you arent happy with your jobs but not willing to do anything about it i just dont see the point in you having this car if you arent going to use it the reason i kept it was so that you had the opportunity to drive to better paying jobs and do errands without worry but you simply dont want to
2744936 you dont have long to think about it either find a job out of the city or ill have to sell the car
2744937 but that means ill have to walk into work at 4am again
2744938 yeah i know but i cant keep a car that isnt being utilized you may be driving 10 miles or so to work but it it highway miles not stop and go city youd get more gas mileage from the car i dont know what else to say those are the only two choices we have
2744939 i guess im going to have to start looking for another job

2744942 ive had my rav4 ev toyotas all electric 4x4 for the last four years
2744943 it was supposed to be a prototype for the next generation of cars but the problem is that the car needs charging every night and the most you can do in a day is 80 miles it is like being tethered

2744950 mengapa pemerintah indonesia tidak pernah memikirkan kesejahteraan kita setelah kita dipaksa untuk meninggalkan keluarga dan kampung halaman karena tidak adanya lapangan pekerjaan di indonesia kita juga masih diperas dengan biaya penempatan yang sangat mahal
2744951 bmi hong kong telah berkali kali melakukan protes terhadap komponen biaya penempatan yang sangat memberatkan bmi lebih jauh bmi juga telah menghitung seharusnya biaya penempatan maksimum hanya satu bulan gaji atau sebesar rp 3 900 000 tapi kenapa hanya usulan pjtki yang selalu di setujui pemerintah
2744952 pemerintah tidak pernah besungguh sungguh melindungi warganya yang menjadi bmi dalam perundang undangan sudah jelas diatur biaya penempatan harus diatur oleh menteri lantas kenapa dirjen binapenta mengeluarkan keputusan biaya penempatan yang bukan wewenangnya
2744953 sangat tidak masuk akal bagi bmi yang ingin memperbaharui kontrak secara mandiri bmi diwajibkan memenuhi 13 syarat yang sangat tidak masuk akal namun bila bmi mengurus melalui agensi 13 syarat tersebut menjadi hilang ini bukti pemerintah memang senagaja membuat bmi sengsara dan agen berpesta fora
2744954 mengingat ratusan ribu bmi di hong kong terancam di phk dan disaat yang sama agensi mulai menggunakan kesempatan ini untuk mengeruk keuntungan yang besar kjri harus segera melakukan tindakan yang nyata untuk melindungi bmi bmi akan merasa terbantu bila kjri bisa mengesahkan dokumen visa kerja bmi tanpa 13 syarat yang tidak masuk akal itu dan juga perlindungan dari keserakahan agen
2744955 bila perlindungan yang mendasar seperti itu saja tidak bisa di berikan oleh kjri untuk warganya buat apa ada kjri pulangkan saja ferry adamhar ke indonesia

2744991 im going to do everything i can to step up to any problems that are going to face the country but again i look forward to doing other things you know next year
2744992 i believe it is going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all of the housing problems
2744993 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2744994 i think it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are important to our capital markets broadly
2744995 we have a regulatory system that is very outdated it was put in place many years ago
2744996 the asset backed was a component of our investment strategy

2745003 now thats one hell of a beard man how long did that take
2745004 ive had a beard for a while you can touch it if you like
2745005 well its where i stash lollipops to surprise kids with you know i do it for the kids
2745006 hey james come here for a second ive gotta a question for you
2745007 when you picture moses or noah in your mind do they have a beard like mine or do you picture them shorn or something
2745008 when you were born while in the hospital your mother told me to give you a kiss boys dont kiss boys i said with a grin and your mother demanded you will kiss your son so i kissed you later though i made a promise to god to give you up to him so that you could be a godly man no matter what
2745009 and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation
2745010 if gasoline ever goes above 1 per gallon im selling my automobile and only riding my bicycle
2745011 this woman came in and give me all kinds of crap about your beard she was totally ranting about it
2745012 yeah she was talking about how dirty and scraggly it looks and asked me why i hired one of those things
2745013 is she a regular customer what did she look like
2745014 shes middle aged and a regular customer i think she thought you were muslim
2745015 point her out next time shes here please i guess ill just have to be extra nice to middle aged women now maybe i should start wearing a kippah i dont want to get the crap kicked out of me for being muslim
2745016 you really shouldnt wear your religion on your sleeve like you do
2745017 if you come back with one of those head coverings or become a jew ill disown ya
2745018 hey james that shabbat thing you talk about maybe thats why g d wants us to rest
2745019 i love you very much dad but if it takes place in a church then i wont attend
2745020 out of respect and honor for your own father you wont attend my funeral see thats just wrong and thats why i dont believe youre right i just dont believe god would tell someone to not go to their own fathers funeral
2745021 why is it so important for you to have your funeral in a church if its so important for me to attend by not going into another house of worship i am honoring my father and mother because im honoring g d
2745022 thats still just wrong i dont believe in a god that would not let a son attend his fathers funeral
2745023 actually dad it was your god jesus that told a man to not attend his fathers funeral
2745024 now remember in your message you promised to call me back
2745025 rabbi trying to get a hold of you is like trying to ask a girl i like out on a date youre playing hard to get
2745026 remember also that job satisfaction should probably be an equal consideration for you as monetary return
2745027 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds improvised explosive devices and authorising their emplacement across the province
2745028 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12
2745029 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2745030 extremist cells in afghanistan operate in small isolated groups and only a few key individuals have any sense of the overall provincial insurgency plan

2745035 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
2745036 we were trying different things we were smoking funny things

2745044 dont be stubborn now ka chan you wouldnt want me to get mad at you right
2745045 here im going to eat this huge half of the omelette
2745046 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

2745048 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
2745049 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

2745053 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2745054 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2745055 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2745056 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2745057 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2745058 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones

2745061 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2745062 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2745078 the fishbein family came up with the idea of giving this trail as a gift
2745079 in 1993 we built our first green building but it didnt create the buzz this building has so we can thank al gore or oil at 140 a barrel our trail has come along at the right time and very much with a purpose
2745080 we wanted to see the composting toilets in any building approved and open to the public
2745081 if small children and international visitors accepted the bathrooms we concluded friends and relatives could accept this idea
2745082 the more we did the more we wanted to do
2745083 this stands as a shining example of what can and should be done in new construction
2745084 this building is very advanced and very functional but has much less of an environmental footprint than any traditional building would
2745085 if we are to live sustainably in the future we really have to change the way we live
2745086 climate change is the number one issue of our time
2745087 at mass audubon we are making a tremendous effort in this area
2745088 seven thousand people in july alone came through this building
2745089 a lot of people were interested in green features and how they could apply them to their own home
2745090 things can be a little more expensive but over time it pays for itself and uses less energy green materials dont have to be renewed and the more and more green materials are produced the price will come down
2745091 it had to grow organically and look like it was part of a whole
2745092 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2745093 a lot of people are disappointed that we elected a democratic congress in 2006 to end the war and nothing happened
2745094 but as voters engage they will see this campaign through the presidential race prism and thats something reichert doesnt want i view this race as a toss up
2745095 reicherts big problem isnt himself its president bush this could come down to the wire just like last time
2745096 when it comes to life and death issues politics is not a factor
2745097 he talks kind of moderate even i could vote for him
2745098 but what he actually does is something else he votes far left
2745099 i dont believe in no win wars that are just police actions
2745100 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2745101 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2745102 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2745103 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2745104 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

2745106 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2745107 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2745108 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2745109 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2745110 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2745111 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2745112 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2745113 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2745114 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2745115 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2745116 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out

2745119 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2745120 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2745121 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2745122 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2745123 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2745124 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2745125 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2745126 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2745127 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2745128 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2745129 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2745130 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2745131 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2745132 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2745133 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2745134 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2745135 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2745136 i dont know how much we raised here but its probably something that starts with a four
2745137 this is one of the best events weve seen in a while
2745138 and thats where the big money really is there are these wealthy people here who put on these lavish fundraisers and they bring in wealthy people from boston or new york it turns into a lot of money
2745139 to win the presidency you have to make sure you have the money and the resources to go out there and tell the truth this area is a great resource to have
2745140 i had to donate the maximum this time this election is too important i needed to put my money where my ideals were
2745141 obviously a lot of money comes out of those things
2745142 youve got a lot of high powered people in one room thats not necessarily representative of the island as a whole weve got a very strong republican network here
2745143 this election simply wont work if people dont participate and money is one important way to participate
2745144 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
2745145 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
2745146 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
2745147 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
2745148 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2745149 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2745150 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2745151 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2745152 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2745153 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2745154 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2745155 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2745156 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2745157 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2745158 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2745159 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2745160 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2745161 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2745162 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2745163 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2745164 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2745165 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2745166 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2745167 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2745168 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2745169 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2745170 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2745171 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2745172 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2745173 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2745174 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
2745175 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
2745176 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2745177 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2745178 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2745179 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2745180 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2745181 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2745182 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2745183 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2745184 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2745185 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2745186 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2745187 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2745188 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2745189 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2745190 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2745191 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2745192 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2745193 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2745194 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2745195 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2745196 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2745197 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2745198 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2745199 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2745200 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2745201 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2745202 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2745203 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2745204 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2745205 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2745206 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2745207 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2745208 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2745209 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2745210 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2745211 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2745212 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2745213 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2745214 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2745215 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2745216 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2745217 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2745218 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2745219 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2745220 is designed to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind
2745221 loony liberalism a kind of ideological m nage a trois between timothy leary karl marx and al gore

2745223 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2745224 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2745225 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2745226 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2745227 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2745228 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2745229 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2745230 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2745231 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2745232 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2745233 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2745234 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2745235 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2745236 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2745237 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2745238 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2745239 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2745240 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2745241 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2745242 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2745243 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2745244 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2745245 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2745246 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2745247 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2745248 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2745249 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2745250 real results by the end of my first term in office
2745251 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2745252 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2745253 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2745254 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2745255 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2745256 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2745257 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2745258 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2745259 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2745260 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2745261 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2745262 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2745263 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2745264 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2745265 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2745266 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2745267 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2745268 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2745269 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2745270 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2745271 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2745272 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2745273 just so you all know we did set a record
2745274 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2745275 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2745276 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2745277 mccain did not have a great week his visual was riding around in a golf cart with old george bush the first
2745278 shears report represents a major change in the mainstream press culture of the past sixteen years
2745279 he genuinely likes reporters hell joke with us about our drinking habits playfully request our cell phones in the middle of a call and tell some unsuspecting editor or parent that the phones owner has just been hauled off to rehab and engage in gleefully sarcastic banter about both our colleagues and his
2745280 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2745281 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2745282 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2745283 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2745284 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2745285 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2745286 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2745287 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2745288 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2745289 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2745290 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2745291 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2745292 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2745293 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2745294 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2745295 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2745296 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2745297 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2745298 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2745299 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2745300 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2745301 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2745302 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2745303 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2745304 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2745305 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2745306 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2745307 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2745308 thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
2745309 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2745310 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2745311 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2745312 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2745313 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2745314 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2745315 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2745316 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2745317 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2745318 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2745319 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2745320 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2745321 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2745322 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2745323 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2745324 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2745325 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2745326 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2745327 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2745328 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2745329 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2745330 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2745331 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2745332 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2745333 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2745334 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2745335 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2745336 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2745337 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2745338 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2745339 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2745340 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2745341 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2745342 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2745343 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2745344 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2745345 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2745346 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2745347 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2745348 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2745349 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2745350 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2745351 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2745352 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2745353 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2745354 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2745355 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2745356 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2745357 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2745358 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2745359 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2745360 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2745361 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2745362 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2745363 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2745364 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2745365 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2745366 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2745367 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2745368 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2745369 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2745370 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2745371 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2745372 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2745373 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2745374 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2745375 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2745376 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2745377 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2745378 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2745379 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2745380 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2745381 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2745382 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2745383 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2745384 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2745385 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2745386 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2745387 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2745388 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2745389 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2745390 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2745391 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2745392 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2745393 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2745394 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2745395 the allies could have undid the cruel versailles treaty and made it clear that germany would get a fair shake in future negotiations on territorial issues
2745396 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2745397 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2745398 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2745399 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2745400 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2745401 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2745402 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2745403 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2745404 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2745405 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2745406 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2745407 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2745408 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2745409 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
2745410 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
2745411 the united states did not have knowledge of her whereabouts until she was detained by the afghan police on july 17
2745412 ms siddiqui was not in custody of the united states either at bagram air base in afghanistan or anywhere else at any time prior to her detention on july 17
2745413 any rumors or allegations to the contrary are absolutely baseless and without any credible foundation whatsoever
2745414 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2745415 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2745416 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2745417 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2745418 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2745419 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2745420 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2745421 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2745422 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2745423 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2745424 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2745425 by regular attendance in classes on the bhagavatam and by rendering of service to the pure devotee all that is troublesome to the heart is almost completely destroyed and loving service unto the personality of godhead who is praised with transcendental songs is established as an irrevocable fact
2745426 the essence of all advice is that one should utilize one s full time twenty four hours a day in nicely chanting and remembering the lord s divine name transcendental form qualities and eternal pastimes thereby gradually engaging one s tongue and mind in this way one should reside in vraja and serve krishna under the guidance of devotees one should follow in the footsteps of the lord s beloved devotees who are deeply attached to his devotional service
2745427 the thoughts of my pure devotees dwell in me their lives are fully devoted to my service and they derive great satisfaction and bliss from always enlightening one another and conversing about me
2745428 the essence of all advice is that one should utilize one s full time twenty four hours a day in nicely chanting and remembering the lord s divine name transcendental form qualities and eternal pastimes thereby gradually engaging one s tongue and mind
2745429 the holy name character pastimes and activities of krishna are all transcendentally sweet like sugar candy although the tongue of one afflicted by the jaundice of avidya ignorance cannot taste anything sweet it is wonderful that simply by carefully chanting these sweet names every day a natural relish awakens within his tongue and his disease is gradually destroyed at the root
2745430 i have been training a lot with my brother to achieve this win
2745431 the main rules have not changed since the beginning of the competition 10 years ago we have six men or women sitting inside the sauna on each round and the winner is the last one to leave

2745438 suddenly surfaced and issued the statement that the baby was his he abruptly quit his position with mr edwards and with financial help from a wealthy edwards supporter fred baron packed up his family and went into hiding
2745439 privately made conflicting statements about the extent of his relationship with ms hunter and whether he is the childs father
2745440 shes not attracted to conventional guys and edwards with his haircut and all is a conventional guy
2745441 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2745442 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2745443 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2745444 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2745445 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2745446 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2745447 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2745448 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2745449 por supuesto que espa a puede derrotar a estados unidos por qu no podemos ir hasta el final
2745450 viewing the 2008 olympics opening ceremony online at nbcs olympics website http www nbcolympics com you can see that the order in which the countries were presented was very different from the actual order of the countries in the ceremony as listed at wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki 2008 summer olympics national flag bearers nbc skipped roughly 100 countries ahead then jumped back and forth apparently delaying the appearance of the united states in its home market until later in the broadcast in fact the us team was shown on the infield before they were shown marching nbc did not acknowledge this in its broadcast is nbc altering the reality of the broadcast to boost ratings was this true only online or also in the live broadcast

2745458 if you dont climb the great wall you wont be a real man

2745526 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2745527 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2745528 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2745529 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2745530 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2745531 i knew my chief of staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district and thats what i knew
2745532 but that is in essence what i knew about the process was not involved in seeing any memos was not involved in any discussions about what was going on thats basically what i knew as the attorney general italics mine

2745537 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2745538 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2745539 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2745555 banned books week celebrating the freedom to read is observed during the last week of september each year
2745556 for the government to claim that the cross is a secular symbol is deeply offensive and betrays a poor understanding of religion and our constitution
2745557 in upholding the display of roadside crosses on public land throughout the state of utah the district court embraced the states characterization of the cross the clearest and most universally recognized marker of christianity as nothing more than a secular symbol of death
2745558 this conclusion is historically inaccurate blind to contemporary realities and offensive to believers and nonbelievers alike
2745559 theyre all from our church and we want you to get to know them and see what you can do to help them i want to tell you that i am not allowed to promote a political candidate from the pulpit because of the irs guidelines im allowed on a radio station to say i want you to vote for tony davis and robby mcgee and charlie taylor but im not allowed to say that in our pulpit
2745560 tax exempt groups cannot use their resources to support or oppose candidates for public office
2745561 when a church paid pastor stands in the tax exempt pulpit and urges the congregation to help certain candidates thats a clear violation he is the top church official and he is there in his official capacity
2745562 i find the manner in which davis issued this pulpit endorsement particularly offensive
2745563 he appears to be openly mocking the irs rules furthermore davis statement indicates that he is clearly aware that the irs does not permit tax exempt houses of worship to engage in partisan politicking he did so anyway fully aware that he was violating the law
2745564 i told him this was my last 400 im and he said well it has to be a record then

2745595 i think they looked a bit nervy at the start and we were playing well
2745596 i wasnt as good defensively as i was in the first match and early on i went for too much
2745597 cnn is watching every angle of this developing story right now
2745598 we will stay with the story given the international ramifications of whats going on
2745599 theres so much at stake right now not just the summer olympics but a lot of diplomatic and economic ramifications as well as we watch very very closely to see whats going on
2745600 something else were watching about an hour and a half from now its expected that protesters whether it be pro china or perhaps free tibet demonstrators will potentially clash as the torch run makes its way through san francisco
2745601 are folks rowdy or are they pretty much under control right now
2745602 in terms of protesting youve never seen protests before on a torch relay this is really the first time
2745603 yes youve never seen it take place like this which means thats why its kind of in part getting a lot of attention because this is a moving target and these protesters have been very aggressive
2745604 the national story today and the national conversation today is the hurricane
2745605 end its crackdown on nonviolent tibetan protesters and its continuing cultural religious economic and linguistic repression inside tibet
2745606 so what youre having here in china is essentially one line being carried by the government any other voices are being censored out
2745607 ive been teaching political science and public policy for almost 30 years and increasingly ive become so disturbed by the assumption that people are self interested
2745608 i think the help your neighbor ethic is the closest thing we have to a universal moral value
2745609 the vast majority of people who get any kind of public or private help dont want it theyre ashamed when they take it and they take it almost always because they need to support their kids or their sick parents
2745610 i think we have a moral obligation to help people who are suffering and thats unconnected to whatever faith you hold or dont hold
2745611 i kept being so angry at the phrase personal responsibility because it was hurled at people and meant take care of yourself and dont be a burden on any one else for most people personal responsibility means taking responsibility for the world around you you notice someone lying on the side of the road you take responsibility

2745656 first such curfews have never been allowed under the laws of the united states barring riot insurrection or natural disaster
2745657 not one case has ever allowed for the imposition of searches seizures and house arrest against innocent citizens because of the high crime rate in a particular city
2745658 notwithstanding the city code and curfew order the residents of helena west helenahave the right to sit under shade trees in their front yard to ride their bicycles along the streets protest this policy and drive around the city with the full protections of the first fourth and fourteenth amendments
2745659 i invite them to move in on second street and be up all nightwith people shooting at them

2745836 the task of the russian forces at present is to ensure control of south ossetia the pipelines would be in danger only if the war escalated
2745837 if russia started an economic blockade then it might target the pipelines

2745947 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
2745948 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
2745949 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
2745950 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
2745951 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
2745952 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
2745953 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
2745954 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
2745955 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
2745956 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
2745957 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
2745958 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
2745959 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
2745960 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
2745961 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
2745962 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
2745963 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
2745964 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
2745965 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
2745966 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
2745967 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
2745968 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
2745969 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
2745970 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
2745971 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
2745972 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
2745973 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
2745974 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
2745975 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
2745976 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
2745977 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
2745978 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
2745979 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
2745980 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
2745981 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
2745982 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that

2745988 im getting my iphone so you might as well get used to it
2745989 on the other hand we have these huge stories going on like the one youre reporting in georgia where you have both candidates mccain and obama taking positions that the american public wants to know more about
2745990 the american public have told pollsters this political season they want substance
2745991 both these candidates have expressed support for allowing georgia into nato for example we are bound by treaty to attack anybody who attacks a nato member we could have been on the verge of nuclear war those are the kinds of the things that the american public wants to see discussed

2746002 what the russians just did is for the first time since the fall of the soviet union they have taken a decisive military action and imposed a military reality
2746003 theyve done it unilaterally and all of the countries that have been looking to the west to intimidate the russians are now forced into a position to consider what just happened
2746004 there is no possibility of drawing nato or the international community into this
2746005 strategically the russians have been sending signals that they really wanted to flex their muscles and theyre upset about kosovo
2746006 if someone went to the russians and said ok kosovo for iran wed have a deal
2746007 weve placed ourselves in a position that globally we dont have the wherewithal to do anything
2746008 weve spent some good money the owner has pulled up and to be fair brought some good players in over the last 18 months

2746016 in our lives there arent a lot of things we can control
2746017 the one thing we can control is ourselves for me i have to be patient and allow the players to get over this i have to help them through it
2746018 the best thing we can do now is come out here and perform
2746019 we came here for our sport as athletes to compete
2746020 i had grapes plums apricots almonds on the other side of the fence
2746021 they took it away about five years ago they said it was for security
2746022 i used to just prune my trees for a month and a half every year now i get two days access in total
2746023 he and others tried to gain access to the land but he said they were met by armed settlers who turned them away and since then he has become despondent about trying again
2746024 in the last six months not a single request by residents to access their land in the area was denied
2746025 i got the beehives about five months ago and this is the first batch
2746026 i spend my time with the bees i have no land but i have something
2746027 this is a contribution to helping people be self sufficient
2746028 they are in a very vulnerable position because they have lost access to their land have little access to water or have lost their job
2746029 there are lots of rosemary bushes in the settlements and this is good for the honey
2746030 in the winter i want to plant my own rosemary
2746031 we have had lots of water problems in the last three years it wiped us out
2746032 we brought in an expert who found water underground we would have to dig about 30 metres to get the water
2746033 if i had access to the water id invest more in agriculture and give the rest of the water to my neighbours
2746034 we have so many problems but the jews settlers have all the water they want

2746041 if its the yatra that matters then lets set our egos aside and concentrate on the yatra lets reconstitute the sasb with only state subjects lets get the governor to pass an ordinance to make the sasb chairman also a state subject
2746042 let the sasb conduct next years yatra with as much land and facilities as it requires facilities created at the expense not of the sasb but of the state government and see if this satisfies the yatris who come from all over the country
2746043 even after this if the need is felt to reduce the yatra to 800 kanals nearly 40 hectares of land im sure that a case can be made to trade 800 kanals for the 3 200 or more kanals of land that wont be used in the future

2746053 we know we only had partial access to these vnrs and yet we found 77 stations using them
2746054 i would say its pretty extraordinary the picture we found was much worse than we expected going into the investigation in terms of just how widely these get played and how frequently these pre packaged segments are put on the air
2746055 they have got very good at mimicking what a real independently produced television report would look like
2746056 we in no way attempt to hide that we are providing the video
2746057 in fact we bend over backward to make this disclosure
2746058 the public obviously expects their news reports are going to be based on real reporting and real information if they are watching an advertisement for a company or a government policy they need to be told

2746066 right then and there i knew i was starting to get more and more excited i was pretty emotional after that race
2746067 a call to action saving lives through nuclear weapons control and disarmament
2746068 it felt like someone had opened the door of a furnace behind you
2746069 weve got to get rid of these nuclear weapons before something terrible happens
2746070 both sides of the camp are talking about the need to reduce nuclear weapons

2746139 the statements from the whole group result in a total lack of coherence from which we easily conclude that theyre all lying
2746140 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible to include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents lack of communication is torture
2746141 there is a sense of anger frustration and great sadness theyve waited for this evidence of sightings for a long time its work they could have started 15 months ago but this is the time for them to keep focus and consider everything carefully before deciding what course of action to take then they will have their day they will make their views clear
2746142 i believe he can recommend charges or action be taken against the police as a whole as well as individual officers
2746143 the early stages of the investigation led by detectives in portimao really were very poor
2746144 a number of people had touched the window and entered madeleines and the twins room prior to the arrival of the gnr local police
2746145 her eyes met mine as i walked past and thats when i saw the little blemish in her right eye it was like a little fleck
2746146 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
2746147 one must suppose that the child madeleine mccann could have died inside the apartment
2746148 the whole attitude throughout was one of we think theyre involved there are some vague indications lets throw caution to the wind and see if we can get a conviction
2746149 the documents are a field of potential leads and any one of them could unlock the case they will never give up the search for madeleine
2746150 a network with all kinds of criminal activities really does exist but the authorities dont want to look into it
2746151 in general paedophiles ask for a particular type of abuse rather than a particular child
2746152 the majority of sexual abuse occurs in the home or by people the child knows
2746153 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2746154 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2746155 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2746156 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here
2746157 the first half of every conference would be about what shes wearing paris would realize that as president she would have to tone it down a little shed lean toward prada
2746158 what would happen is rihanna would step off the plane in fishnet stockings music would blare and whole countries would melt at the sight of her
2746159 it would be like bush at the crawford ranch she would be in l a more than she would in washington d c
2746160 omdat de curatoren van de kristalproducent hun functie nog niet hebben opgenomen is het voorbarig vandaag al te praten over een kandidaat overnemer
2746161 ge valueerd worden in functie van het belang van het kristalbedrijf de werknemers en de schuldeisers
2746162 rekening houdend met de band tussen het merk en de productieactiviteiten is het waarschijnlijk dat de beslissing over het einde van het merk en de modaliteiten daarvan worden genomen in samenspraak met de curatoren van het kristalbedrijf
2746163 if youre running for president you get on a pedestal
2746164 motorcades happen for you you get the adulation of crowds and if you get to be president all the planes stop when your plane takes off and when you die youre on a stamp he one thing you cant do is to cheat
2746165 the reason why the john edwards thing i think is so striking is the other way the rules have changed
2746166 the press which never used to cover private matters does
2746167 i think that a lot of the focus of the affair actually has been about its impact on elizabeth edwards
2746168 obviously elizabeth edwards story her fight with cancer the fact that shes well liked and has very high regard i think is what has really made this story stick a little bit more than maybe it would for somebody else
2746169 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march of 2007
2746170 you know that when you die when anyone dies youre going to leave a bunch of headaches behind for the people behind us in addition the fact that theyll miss us of course and so im trying to minimize that to the extent that i can
2746171 gotta do something with your day and thats what i choose to do
2746172 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
2746173 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
2746174 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
2746175 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
2746176 people have come to the conclusion that the closer he is to wanting to obtain power the more difficult others will make it for him to achieve that
2746177 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2746178 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2746179 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2746180 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2746181 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2746182 a large trend is being crystallized among the palestinian national authority pna in ramallah to call for settling the situation with the gaza strip by force
2746183 to give the last chance for the egyptian government and the arab league to convince hamas to immediately end its coup and engage in the dialogue
2746184 but the door for dialogue will not be open forever and the leadership only gave one month time for the efforts
2746185 will be a dangerous thing if it was officially made
2746186 it will boost the internal split and separate gaza from the west bank
2746187 fatah elements who dominate the plos executive committee have a plan to prevent any attempt of approach between hamas and fatah
2746188 im john thank you for allowing me to serve you today

2746220 acordes y sustentables para que puedan competir con el uso de recurso suelo esta es la variante m s importante para continuar manteniendo las explotaciones del tambo en actividad
2746221 el acuerdo representa una mejora sustancial de entre el 25 y el 30 por ciento en un lapso tan corto de entre 30 y 60 d as y es un paso sustancial hacia la obtenci n de un precio superior en un futuro mediato

2746225 no parece probable que siga habiendo flujos del exterior mientras la imagen internacional del sector inmobiliario siga siendo tan negativa

2746236 cheguei muito mal fiz uma chegada dif cil e sentia que j n o dava para dar mais uma
2746237 senti que n o houve nenhum erro em rela o prova mas estou ansiosa por chegar l acima e falar com o meu treinador de fora s vezes as pessoas v em as coisas de uma forma de que n s n o nos apercebemos porque tudo se passa de forma muito r pida

2746245 in 2005 a car accident left him injured and his 1991 lincoln mark vii totaled while he would need three months of physical therapy to deal with a bulging disc in his back his obsession focused less on mending than on making some extra cash to buy a new car surfing the web one day he came across a call for submissions in a screenwriting competition the grand prize was 10 000 so he began to write the first scenes of what he called kind of an epic the intertweaving stories of three police officers who have misplaced their moral compasses and grown to hate themselves a little along the way

2746251 most authors have no control over their book covers but some writers by virtue of their renown or contractual caveat not only get to accept or reject designs but also choose the designer
2746252 certainly no one was predicting that in 2007 a futuristic celebrity ringmaster like kanye west would make online self disclosure the rule and not the exception creating a masterpiece blog building an online gallery of art and design and showcasing it in a stunning web site that would improbably cross memoir and mall

2746256 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2746257 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2746258 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2746259 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2746260 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2746261 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2746262 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2746263 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2746264 we communicated that message beforehand to the russians through u s secretary of state condoleezza rice
2746265 we must check all that we dont trust the georgian side
2746266 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2746267 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2746268 the deployment is quite natural we dont want a repeat of what happened in south ossetia
2746269 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2746270 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2746271 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2746272 it was difficult to accept for about two or three weeks after the season had concluded but during that time i was able to spend time with my family and that opened my eyes
2746273 ive two young boys and they dont know or care whats going on at a football club
2746274 and that really put it into perspective for me there was no point me being down and feeling the world was against me i have two children who are fit and healthy and i realised during that time off when i was with them that i should be very thankful
2746275 therefore after a short break i was itching to get started again
2746276 ive signed a new contract in june so ill be with birmingham for at least another two years now the target is to make sure that during the second year of that new contract im playing with blues in the premiership again
2746277 the championship is such an open league i would say that any one of 12 teams could see themselves promoted at the end of the season
2746278 its without doubt the most competitive league i will have ever played in
2746279 we are obviously one of the favourites to go up and there will be extra pressure placed upon us seeing as weve only come down but i believe we can handle that
2746280 its certainly not going to be easy and were all aware of that but we have the hunger desire and more importantly quality to return to the premier league
2746281 last year is a case in point where you could really never have envisaged that stoke city and hull city would be the two teams promoted alongside west brom
2746282 it just goes to show you that no side is likely to run away with it every side will beat each other and so many teams have a genuine chance of going up
2746283 everything is safe now there is no need to worry we can handle it
2746284 i was very scared i dared not leave the building and go to my dormitory
2746285 i know i have a lot to do to make up for this small score
2746286 i should have done a lot better but im confident that next week ill be standing on the rostrum at dundrod
2746287 but i showed i could lap faster than anyone and i give myself a great chance on saturday i won the senior tt in june and this was nearly enough to set me up for the season
2746288 my grandfather was involved in the bookmaking firm many years ago
2746289 he then moved to cumbria and thats when my father came on the scene and of course i followed on
2746290 it would give me a great thrill to win the superbike race at the ulster grand prix for i have never done so perhaps this will be my year
2746291 people talk about this turnaround and offer all kinds of reasons
2746292 but the reality is that weve had five one point games
2746293 people will say that a division one or two side shouldnt lose to a team from division four but i really dont believe wicklow ever got the credit they deserved
2746294 its par for the course and only right because you are judged on your ability to win a competitive environment
2746295 i am more than pleased with it that was my first 2k since the injury two months ago i was in hospital now i feel there is more to come in this regatta
2746296 my knee felt very good i didnt feel any pings during the race and i am looking forward now to the quarter finals
2746297 i took a more conservative race than usual i would usually have blasted a bit further from the start but the boys pushed me hard throughout i am more than pleased
2746298 every race we are going to step it up a little bit more and a little bit more fingers crossed toes crossed everything crossed that we can have a nice clean run through to the semi finals now
2746299 attempt to create a home for community driven specifications following the open source model similar to the apache software foundation the foundation is aimed at building a lightweight framework to help communities deal with the legal requirements necessary to create successful and widely adopted specification
2746300 beijing is a safe city but unfortunately we are not immune to violent acts
2746301 we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through
2746302 we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2746303 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2746304 i think it will be a cracking contest given some decent weather and i think we can come away with a win
2746305 even before last winters signings of regan west and opening bowler john costain i said that along with north down csni were the best and most competitive side we play against so i fully expected to go into this season and be severely pushed by them
2746306 i try to look at the two sides objectively and i think they are pretty evenly matched csni have perhaps more fire power in their batting whereas we perhaps have more depth and the bowling sides compare pretty well
2746307 we will be going into the final on the back of a very good run so there will be no shortage of confidence
2746308 we employ the take every game as it comes approach and so far thats worked well we will talk through our tactics working out our strategy to cope with either batting first or fielding
2746309 the insights and benefits of traditional chinese herbal medicines to consumers all over the world
2746310 tonight was just about getting to tomorrow i just wanted to conserve as much as i could and make it into the semi final and hopefully the final
2746311 to hear his voice and get leadership from him hes been the guy for the last four years to build up our team hes deidicated so much time and energy for us
2746312 now that ive gotten a taste of it i dont know i guess i may have to negotiate a little bit with my husband
2746313 for now im going to focus on helping him get elected and raising our kids
2746314 im looking forward to being a mom and a wife and a business owner
2746315 that was a really important visit im pretty sure i wouldnt have been as focused today had i had that moment with them yesterday
2746316 ive been a pretty selfish mom and a very unselfish athlete for about three years now and its time to put my family first its probably time to move on
2746317 a bad fault is hard to recover from she might be more cautious than before
2746318 but shes been preparing for a long time she may be more careful but i think she should come through
2746319 i estimate that probably 90 percent of the stores at any given time have coupons available so its just a question of finding them
2746320 you cant usually double up on coupon codes its true but you can typically stack them on top of a sale thats going on
2746321 if youre willing to hold off until the deal happens youll get much better savings the more flexibility you have as a shopper the more power you have
2746322 you wouldnt expect amazon the bookseller to have food but they sell thousands and thousands of non perishable items and theyre probably 20 to 30 percent cheaper than the grocery store on average
2746323 if youd rather go to the store print out the online offer and see if the store location will match it

2746333 it is a phenomenal achievement he mendis came in when murali muttiah muralitharan needed support and he rose to the occasion well
2746334 he has gone beyond our expectations and the important thing for him is to keep learning
2746335 its disappointing that we have not performed as a batting unit these are the guys who have won games for india its just a matter of not clicking i dont know how it happened
2746336 its a good wicket to bat on and i hope we bat well on monday we are looking forward to a good partnership in the morning
2746337 basically the ferrari has more of a tendency to understeer than the mclaren the mclaren is a little bit oversteery when the tyre has good grip the car with the oversteer tendency will be quicker over a single lap than a neutral or understeering car
2746338 but when you think about racing conditions especially with the temperatures we had at the hungaroring then an oversteering car will have heat generating at the rear much higher than the understeering car
2746339 looking at hungary and lewis hamiltons car behaviour after a few laps he struggled with oversteer so he was making lots of counter steering movements on the other hand the ferrari had a good balance after a few laps
2746340 its the only bit of green we see around here its something nice to look at and reminds us of home
2746341 the closest one was about 100m from here we could hear the bang funnily enough im never scared of it what will happen will happen

2746345 everyone is such a great artist and the community is wonderful i never would have imagined the amazing growth of etsy and how much it has impacted me personally
2746346 it does disturb your concentration but youve gotta try and regroup again
2746347 i probably didnt because i missed that next target but all in all i was pretty happy with the way the final went i give it me all
2746348 youre pouring your guts out trying to qualify for the final then you make the final and youve gotta give it extra
2746349 youre just about running on empty by the end of the final anyway then to go back and shoot for the bronze was really hard it takes its toll on you
2746350 it was the most pain ive ever experienced racing i thought i wasnt moving i thought possibly i could stop in the water
2746351 what happens outside the pool is no one elses business my focus has always been on swimming
2746352 that race hurt more than any 400 ive done before
2746353 i dont swim well in the small meetings id rather not be there

2746362 the girls demand for the beatles forced ed sullivan along with most other media outlets to bring the beatles to america
2746363 i had no idea campo gave me the evil eye when he walked into the dressing shed i just said to give herby a go his confidence is sky high and that is obviously pretty disappointing on my behalf but he didnt know we werent talking about it out there so he had no idea
2746364 herby already had the shot lined up so i said oh well i think it was assistant coach dave furners call actually because he had 10 goals and would have broken daves record
2746365 but obviously if we had known earlier we would have sent the message out to let campo take it
2746366 guys like mal and furnsy have been around the club for many years and ive only been here for a few so it doesnt bother me to be second in line to guys like that just even to be in the record breaking line is unbelievable considering the talent that has been at the raiders for years before this
2746367 i was man of the match but i think he will be players player and i dont know if i deserved it he played great and hes been playing great at the back end of the season ive been playing with him for a while and this is as good as ive seen him play and i think he will continue it i feel terrible about what happened at the end i didnt realise and the boys chucked the ball to me so i took the kick
2746368 during the week we were all pretty honest with ourselves as players pretty much conceding weve been letting ourselves down over the last few weeks
2746369 whatever it is we were just poor today and they were a lot more energetic and desperate
2746370 a possible scenario is that theyll try and get some cash involved centricas balance sheet is good and it has no debt so theyve got room to manoeuvre in that regard
2746371 the comments from the government suggested to centrica that they have to put a cash element in there

2746377 this being a generational shift we believe its putting more space between us and our nearest competitor
2746378 weve received some feedback on the pricing theres been a lot of surprise that its very competitive
2746379 theres also been a lot of interest around features like virtual provisioning and how weve enhanced our ability to provide support for virtualisation as well
2746380 in any case zend view layout is high on our priority list so i believe this should move forward quickly soon and even if its not in an official release youll be able to pull it out of the incubator
2746381 5 raisons qui font que les bonnes r solutions sont difficiles appliquer
2746382 western countries behaved strangely in the first hours of aggression towards south ossetia they were silent
2746383 this raises very serious questions about sincerity and their attitude towards our country and will of course be taken into account in the future when we hold talks and talk about global issues
2746384 western media is a well organised machine which is showing only those pictures which fit in well with their thoughts we find it very difficult to squeeze our opinion in the pages of their newspapers
2746385 just as it was 20 30 years ago it remains the same today objectivity is not a typical trait of some western journalists and television channels
2746386 dan apa saja yang diberikan kepada kamu maka itu adalah kenikmatan hidup duniawi dan perhiasannya sedangkan apa yang di sisi allah adalah lebih baik dan lebih kekal maka apakah kamu tidak memahaminya maka apakah orang yang kami janjikan kepadanya suatu janji yang baik surga lalu ia memperolehnya sama dengan orang yang kami berikan kepadanya kenikmatan hidup duniawi kemudian dia pada hari kiamat termasuk orang orang yang diseret ke dalam neraka
2746387 dan dikatakan kepada mereka pada hari ini kami melupakan kamu sebagaimana kamu telah melupakan pertemuan dengan harimu ini dan tempat kembalimu ialah neraka dan kamu sekali kali tidak memperoleh penolong yang demikian itu karena sesungguhnya kamu menjadikan ayat ayat allah sebagai olok olokan dan kamu telah ditipu oleh kehidupan dunia maka pada hari ini mereka tidak dikeluarkan dari neraka dan tidak pula mereka diberi kesempatan untuk bertaubat
2746388 maka berpalinglah hai muhammad dari orang yang berpaling dari peringatan kami dan tidak mengingini kecuali kehidupan duniawi itulah sejauh jauh pengetahuan mereka sesungguhnya tuhanmu dialah yang paling mengetahui siapa yang tersesat dari jalan nya dan dia pulalah yang paling mengetahui siapa yang mendapat petunjuk
2746389 we were trying to cover all options and we were hoping that exactly that would happen
2746390 we did a lead out on the hill on thursday the training day
2746391 i led them out then emma picked up the tempo sharon laws was on her wheel so we had already rehearsed that finish we knew the point at 200 metres to go where we wanted nicole to go we knew at what point the legs would be getting heavy
2746392 we wanted to make sure she laid off coming into the final corner but perhaps not that far
2746393 we were afraid someone might come down in front of her so we told her to keep to the left we knew she would chew them up after that
2746394 the plan was emma would go three kilometres from the turnstiles on the last lap
2746395 as soon as she came into the road she was to attack as hard as she could to put the germans on the defensive it worked emmas attack was fully committed
2746396 nicole could watch and wait because the other riders know what emma can do on her own so they were thinking would she ride away or was she bluffing we felt the germans were the most dangerous and they were put on the defensive one was using up all her energy chasing and trixi worrack their best rider was flapping
2746397 i thought yes we can stay away these girls want to catch guderzo so whatever happens well be going fast there was no decision it was just yes this is the time now
2746398 it was like a working group trying to find out the best case scenarios for getting me to the olympics
2746399 its a team effort but its not just the riders the staff and backup as well
2746400 i had tried the other route racing all season but got to major championships without full energy in the tank so why do the same thing if it had been proven not to work
2746401 but it was a high risk strategy because i was trying it for the first time i stuck to the plan and i believe in it

2746430 i am most concerned you have no contact with the complainants in this matter and those individuals are officer brian white and investigator joann kinney
2746431 you do that for a lot of reasons and one is to ensure that witnesses arent manipulated

2746448 opportunities are waiting for you this symbol indicates that there are opportunities waiting for the querist you must not be afraid to open the door and go through it ot see what opportunities lie on the other side
2746449 this card signifies that you feel tied down and frustrated in some aspect of your life and wish to break free do not rely on someone else to set you free
2746450 yeah you definitely want to return them but you also have to be smart about it and take whats given to you and do the right thing
2746451 we have three more preseason games ill get my opportunities im sure of that
2746452 i was ready last year but i hurt my toe and i had to play with it
2746453 it was difficult but now im healthy and hopefully it works out here i feel really good right now
2746454 i got drafted there and they gave me my first chance to play professional football the organization really supported me and did a lot for my progression and i thank them for that
2746455 it was great seeing everybody today it was a special night it was a lot of fun i wish those guys the best but i love it here im very happy where im at now id love to spend my whole career here
2746456 just the environment it was great it felt good its football man thats what i play nothing different just get out there and keep making the same plays
2746457 it was a great opportunity for me to go out there and work with donovan and just get out there with the rest of the guys and have some fun
2746458 i think he did a great job for his first outing
2746459 your first game you kind of get butterflies and get nervous at times but i thought he handled it well on special teams as well as on offense its a growing process and he still has a lot of things to learn
2746460 hes making sure that hes seeking help and hes communicating with others and thats always a positive thing
2746461 any time you go through a situation like this when you kind of just feel like youre alone and stuck in a corner and have no one to rely on certain individuals have reached out to him and made sure that he knows that he has support and the backing of his teammates
2746462 its kind of disappointing when you talk it up and talk it up and then nothing happens
2746463 the houston area got most of the rain today two to four inches
2746464 with instability caused by the low pressure we could still see a 50 percent chance of rainfall throughout the day
2746465 com certeza o local ser valorizado o essencial deve ser preservado mas n o se pode imobilizar a cidade
2746466 cada bairro tem sua pr pria din mica e isso levado em conta quando os t cnicos analisam os processos nunca houve a inten o de tombar esses im veis na lapa a maioria deles n o tem valor hist rico o que ocorreu foi que a lei de zoneamento de 2004 os incluiu automaticamente em processo de tombamento
2746467 houve um erro de avalia o do momento da economia
2746468 houve uma entrada muito grande de novos investidores no mercado e nessas aberturas houve um processo de extrapola o de expectativas
2746469 as pessoas pegavam o ltimo lucro da empresa esperando que essa inje o de capital proporcionada pelo ipo desse um determinado retorno mas a rentabilidade do investimento n o cresceu na mesma velocidade
2746470 as empresas n o conseguiram potencializar todo o crescimento esperado delas e os investidores acabaram migrando saindo dessas a es que estavam com excesso e se ajustando mais realidade do mercado
2746471 os investidores ganharam muito dinheiro nas negocia es no primeiro dia depois as empresas precisam come ar a desenvolver seus projetos eles t m que dar retorno e t m que contar com panorama positivo do mercado o que n s observamos que em m dia esses resultados ficaram abaixo do que seria o esperado
2746472 corrobora o fato de a bolsa n o estar indo bem e o fato de algumas empresas n o estarem tocando bem os seus projetos
2746473 os casos da bm amp f e da bovespa s o t picos porque se tinha uma expectativa de que a bolsa ia crescer mais por conta dos ipos e porque a economia estava crescendo muito forte com a pr pria redu o do movimento da bolsa um ciclo que se fecha
2746474 o momento do mercado e n o os fundamentos das empresas foram preponderantes para esse movimento
2746475 na hora em que eles os investidores precisaram de recursos eles tiraram as a es a qualquer pre o e derrubaram as cota es
2746476 a crise americana foi o que deflagrou um pouco essa redu o do crescimento essa aterrissagem mais for ada da economia mundial e pegou essas empresas num momento ruim
2746477 em 2007 2008 as hip teses que estavam sendo esperadas n o se realizaram
2746478 no longo prazo as empresas tendem a recuperar isso elas tendem a crescer de uma forma mais est vel e com uma estrutura de capital melhor mas n o vai ser no n vel que as pessoas esperam
2746479 esse tipo de investidor estrangeiro deve voltar at o final do ano mas n o deve voltar no patamar que estava antes

2746502 ich brauchte geld nicht f r luxus aber f r einen gewissen lebensstandard f r ein handy klamotten miete und strom
2746503 und ab einem bestimmten zeitpunkt h tte mir auch das milieu gefehlt
2746504 alles aufzuschreiben war eine chance f r mich diese aufregende zeit noch einmal zu durchleben
2746505 ich wollte einfach schildern wie es wirklich ist nicht alle huren sind zwangsprostituierte sondern viele machen es freiwillig und manchmal macht es sogar spa
2746506 ich dachte dass ich von diesem tag an ein doppelleben f hren w rde auf der einen seite sonia die liebe freundin und studentin auf der anderen nancy die f r geld zu haben war an meinem k rper klebte der schwei fremder m nner doch das knistern der scheine in meinem portemonnaie und der duft des herannahenden essens schalteten mein gewissen erst mal aus

2746509 in den puff kamen t rken aus neuk lln vietnamesen aus hohensch nhausen es kamen typen im anzug aus zehlendorf oder charlottenburg und familienv ter in shorts und mit umh ngetasche aus prenzlauer berg
2746510 ich denke probleme wie zwangsprostitution muss man an der wurzel bek mpfen eine frau die in ihrer heimat die m glichkeit hat ihre familie zu ern hren sich zu entwickeln wird nicht auf die idee kommen einem dubiosen typen 5000 euro zu geben damit der sie nach deutschland oder westeuropa schleust wo sie ausgenutzt wird
2746511 viele menschen haben zwar keine vorurteile gegen ber prostituierten aber nur solange es um leute geht mit denen sie pers nlich nichts zu tun haben
2746512 aber das kann man nie wissen wenn ich in 30 jahren pleite dastehe dann werde ich es sicher wieder tun denn man ist ja nie zu alt daf r es gibt ja frauen die auch noch mit 60 anschaffen gehen

2746517 die probleme die wir sehen sind die fehlende nachvollziehbarkeit und transparenz der stimmabgabe und es ist sehr einfach das ger t zu manipulieren

2746529 eating more kangaroo has an incredible array of benefits for our environment for dietary health and as a tasty red meat
2746530 the soft padded feet of kangaroos are far kinder to the land than the hooves of sheep and cattle which have caused untold damage and consequent land erosion

2746533 besonders am anfang gab es sehr viele gelbe flaggen und nico war sehr schnell deshalb kam ich nicht weg gegen ende des rennens waren meine reifen nicht mehr optimal und ich habe mich darauf konzentriert das rennen nach hause zu fahren
2746534 mein start war nicht optimal da ich mit meinen reifen auf der wei en linie keinen grip bekommen habe
2746535 in den ersten runden des rennens war ich noch zuversichtlich jules berholen zu k nnen allerdings gab es sehr viele gelbe flaggen was einen angriff unm glich machte je l nger es dauerte umso schwieriger wurde es auf jules druck auszu ben da meine reifen abbauten

2746540 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis

2746630 a sad day for the country and a sad day for the constitution
2746631 any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party but the fallout from this decision will not be random
2746632 no mans life liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session
2746633 get with the plan or get out of the way
2746634 we are going to be fighting this battle for several years
2746635 despite the interstate name the highway would be a piece of gov rick perrys trans texas corridor
2746636 txdot and their buddies continue to steamroll a plan the majority of texans dont want
2746637 if they dont end this public fleecing there wont be enough political cover for the consequences at the ballot box
2746638 critics say moving ahead right now is a slap in the face to the legislature
2746639 txdot is legally obligated to start its entire environmental study process over
2746640 txdots minute order does little to truly bind it in its future dealings
2746641 toll roads and private toll roads will continue to be on the states agenda
2746642 gov perry and the legislature have seen tolls as a way to avoid raising taxes to pay for roads a position that neither seem eager to change
2746643 the federal government has no business being partner to this outrageous plan
2746644 ttc 69 is not officially dead we need to take every step possible until it is officially dead
2746645 txdot has no obligation to make any changes just obligation to listen
2746646 txdot is working for a governor who is dead set on building a massive superhighway system that the texas public simply does not want
2746647 overwhelmingly to a staggering degree the reaction is negative against it
2746648 any resemblance to free market principles is more illusion than fact
2746649 we intend to continue turning over all the rocks to see what crawls out
2746650 foreign companies acquiring u s highways raising tolls and stopping competition through contracts
2746651 investors want to acquire large public assets here why thats a bad idea
2746652 efforts to toll newly constructed lanes would not be prohibited in hutchisons amendment
2746653 the public interest can be subordinated to the private interest
2746654 if you want to make changes in txdot now is the time
2746655 do we really want foreign business using our eminent domain powers for their profit
2746656 if you think the old proposition 15 was a disaster just try voting for this one
2746657 north american ppp public private partnership amp infrastructure finance conference
2746658 the inconvenience of a special session is a small price to pay to preserve these critical elements of freedom
2746659 toll road critics are leery of this last minute legislative maneuver
2746660 if it takes a special session to get this right im all for it
2746661 in east texas a lot of people think i 69 is going to be a serious upgrade of u s 59 but if theyre going to build a whole new corridor watch out
2746662 cintra agreed to seek the contract with the understanding it would not have to compete against the ntta
2746663 budget would give legislators a tighter grip on the state department of transportation
2746664 theres no reason that texans must become slaves to toll roads
2746665 selling highways is not politically correct in this state i dont care how much you get for it
2746666 it is unnecessary and inappropriate to ask private entities to loan us money to build highways
2746667 the effort to halt private toll road deals is not over
2746668 we would forfeit billions with private partnership on sh 121
2746669 what a shame we dont have recall elections for the governor in texas
2746670 rmas can build roads outside the city outside the state and outside the country
2746671 people from all over the u s have an eye on what texans will do to stop this mammoth project
2746672 another revolution is now brewing at the local and grass roots level in texas
2746673 pay your 15 cents a mile and get the heck out of my way
2746674 its a big mistake for public officials to rush into a fire sale of the publics assets
2746675 leading the house through coercion and intimidation has not produced a better texas
2746676 one of the most dramatic coups in recent texas political history
2746677 politicians may love to sell roads but the public isnt buying
2746678 the wisest way to conquer an enemy isnt with bullets or bombs
2746679 the people of central texas need to be treated like valued constituents not just resources to be harvested
2746680 rational alternatives to txdots nutty toll road or no road sales pitch sen
2746681 its about making money for these foreign companies that will run the trans texas corridor
2746682 props 1 amp 9 simply allow perry to keep his tax raising bureaucrats and politicians in power longer
2746683 governments should avoid public private infrastructure deals led by investment banks
2746684 this is going to be an amendment to issue bonds and were the ones who will be holding the bank
2746685 kick out lackluster governor a few dozen incompetent special interest legislators and appointed officials
2746686 why do officials keep on trying to shove the ttc down our throats
2746687 the ploy is to move private rail into gov rick perrys texas corridor after he promised no public funds would be used
2746688 there seems to be an overemphasis on money and not on service
2746689 private toll roads would not be financially viable without the huge government subsidies
2746690 the only project more controversial than toll roads is ttc 35
2746691 it is imperative that texans recognize the truth and vote down propositions 1 amp 9 with a vengeance
2746692 the state is committing taxpayers to massive debt for generations while private special interest corporations profit
2746693 since some lawmakers serve on mpo boards there is no separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches of government
2746694 they have a plan for making free roads so slow that people would be forced to take the toll lanes
2746695 this road leads to three cities ones called political patronage the others called corruption and the others called graft
2746696 the citizens of texas have a right to know what theyre being obligated to
2746697 an earful with very little of the commentary being positive
2746698 the trans texas corridor will be owned by the people of texas
2746699 txdot could still condemn property for ancillary facilities with the approval of local county commisioners court
2746700 i dont want tolls on federal highways period end of statement
2746701 planned international corridor is a giant step towards the complete destruction of property rights in america
2746702 im not going to be run over from some guy with a big ego from txdot
2746703 i think what they need to do is widen the roads they have and make improvements
2746704 taxpayers should have a say about something as fundamental as our highway system
2746705 reminds me of the argument that the lotto would go toward paying for schools
2746706 private developers cant condemn private property for the trans texas corridor
2746707 private companies are not necessarily more efficient at running roads and their tolls amount to a regressive tax on highway building
2746708 local leaders didnt learn about the proposal until shortly after it was submitted to the state in april
2746709 the supreme court is telling us to trust our elected officials thats a nice idea in concept but a bad one in practice
2746710 cintra will not ask for local state or federal contributions
2746711 european foreign run toll roads will turn txdot into eurodot
2746712 people willing to sit around and compose recommendations that may or may not be heeded
2746713 well get a share of the tolls when they recover their investment
2746714 theres far more structure in this agreement than we were led to believe
2746715 governors motives are open to question in light of the large campaign contributions he received from interests boosting the privatized corridors
2746716 the whole nation is watching texas to see if we can pull it off
2746717 cintra will not ask for local state or federal contributions
2746718 we are about to witness eminent domain taken to a level unforeseen before
2746719 state officials as well as the news media need to do a far better job of educating the public
2746720 texas transportation commission voted unanimously to begin negotiations with spain based cintra
2746721 sweeping new policy became law without public demand or awareness
2746722 we could put 50 texans on the moon cheaper and ive got a list
2746723 i think its nothing but a scheme to raise money for the state of texas
2746724 we are getting a lot of double speak from the state on the project and that is destroying the level of trust
2746725 i havent seen any concern at all from rural areas
2746726 plenty of political muscle was flexed on behalf of proposition 15
2746727 us claims that the military surge is bringing stability to iraq

2746735 we have asked asa to look at tra as an alternative to uncontrolled airspace because it gives a greater ability to be aware of all the traffic in that airspace
2746736 airservices seems bent on shifting the blame to those who have been holding a failing system together rather than accepting the consequences of its own mismanagement of human resources across an extended period of time
2746737 the snow settled this morning but its just wet now

2746759 in other words if bush personally killed an american soldier he would be guilty of murder under the law he cannot immunize himself from his criminal responsibility by causing a third party to do the killing hes still responsible george bush cannot sit safely in his oval office in washington d c while young american soldiers fighting his war are being blown to pieces by roadside bombs in iraq and wash his hands of all culpability its not quite that easy he could only do this if he did not take this nation into war under false pretenses if he did which the evidence overwhelmingly shows he is criminally responsible for the thousands of american deaths in iraq
2746760 a robber for instance was convicted of first degree murder under the felony murder rule where as he was leaving the store in which he had robbed the owner he told the owner not to say a word or hed be harmed and fired into the ceiling to scare the owner the shot after two or three ricochets pierced the head of the owner killing him in fact the felony murder rule applies even where the defendant is not the killer there have been cases where the proprietor of the store fired at a robber missed him and hit and killed a customer and the robber was convicted of first degree murder of the customer
2746761 to commit any offense against the united states or to defraud the united states or any agency thereof in any manner or for any purpose
2746762 i would be more than happy if requested to consult with any prosecutor who decides to prosecute bush in preparation of additional cross examination questions for him to face on the witness stand i believe the cross examination would be such that theyd have to carry the arrogant son of privilege off the stand on a stretcher

2746774 he told president hu that this is an important aspect of the u s china dialogue and that the chinese can expect that any future american president will also make it an important aspect of our dialogue
2746775 president hu seemed to indicate that the door is open to religious freedom in china and that in the future there will be more room for religious believers
2746776 it just goes to show that god is universal god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

2746778 i think we play with our qualities african footballers are very physically strong technical too but whats important is that we move with the ball and without the ball
2746779 that means we had to play offensive football and thats why we ended up giving them too much space the three forwards from the ivory coast really need space

2746811 you can control beijing as much as you like but youre not going to see much of an effect

2746857 houve um erro de avalia o do momento da economia
2746858 houve uma entrada muito grande de novos investidores no mercado e nessas aberturas houve um processo de extrapola o de expectativas
2746859 as pessoas pegavam o ltimo lucro da empresa esperando que essa inje o de capital proporcionada pelo ipo desse um determinado retorno mas a rentabilidade do investimento n o cresceu na mesma velocidade
2746860 as empresas n o conseguiram potencializar todo o crescimento esperado delas e os investidores acabaram migrando saindo dessas a es que estavam com excesso e se ajustando mais realidade do mercado
2746861 os investidores ganharam muito dinheiro nas negocia es no primeiro dia depois as empresas precisam come ar a desenvolver seus projetos eles t m que dar retorno e t m que contar com panorama positivo do mercado o que n s observamos que em m dia esses resultados ficaram abaixo do que seria o esperado

2746864 o momento do mercado e n o os fundamentos das empresas foram preponderantes para esse movimento

2746896 but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
2746897 john made a terrible mistake in 2006 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my diagnosis in march 2007
2746898 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2746899 admitting ones mistakes is a hard thing for anyone to do and i am proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame the toll on our family of news helicopters over our house and reporters in our driveway is yet unknown but now the truth is out and the repair work that began in 2006 will continue
2746900 i ask that the public who expressed concern about the harm john edwards conduct has done to us think also about the real harm that the present voyeurism does and give me and my family the privacy we need at this time
2746901 i dont just say no to anybody because id hope that people wouldnt say no to me just because im an actor but they would have to be pretty extraordinary
2746902 my parents have been married 25 years with all the glory and the pain you can imagine but have stayed together i want a strong marriage like that

2746979 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
2746980 there are critics though and i am one of them that think perhaps investors are not quite getting what they expect for a start the holdings in the index funds are market capitalisation weighted this sounds sensible of course except when you consider just how much the biggest companies dominate the portfolio the top one hundred stocks in america representing just 3 of the number of stocks in the index funds actually account for over 60 of the funds invested in vanguards fund
2746981 when you get down to the genuinely small capitalisation stocks there is actually very little money invested in each stock which is why it probably isnt surprising that over long periods of time the wilshire 5000 index performs pretty much the same as the big capitalisation growth stock dominated s amp p500 index
2746982 the art of creating a good portfolio is not about owning everything in market weighted proportions as the total market index does but in having significant exposure to every asset class and rebalancing the portfolio at an appropriate frequency
2746983 so if you want to take advantage of the rebalancing effect you are going to need to have a much larger small cap value exposure in your portfolio than just a couple of percent
2746984 while s amp p 500 index and total market funds make for effective pieces on an investment pie they should only be slices not the whole pie they just dont provide sufficient diversification as stand alone vehicles

2747030 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2747031 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2747032 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2747033 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2747034 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2747035 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2747036 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2747037 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2747038 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2747039 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2747040 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2747041 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2747042 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2747043 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2747044 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2747045 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2747046 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2747047 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2747048 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2747049 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2747050 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2747057 pauls utterly enchanted with nancy and hes already rolling the idea of marriage around in his head

2747060 the whole family thinks nancys great a vast improvement on pauls last love interest
2747061 nancy and bruce have been separated a long time but her relationship with paul has spurred them on to finally dissolve the marriage
2747062 theyve moved on with their lives and bruce approves of paul its all amicable
2747063 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years theyve got so much in common he knows heather was a mistake although he loves their little one bea more than anything and wont be put off by a bad divorce experience

2747069 a derrota por quatro gols d uma conota o ampliada e n o muito real do que foi o jogo
2747070 n o criamos muitas oportunidades mas encaixamos bem a marca o sofremos o gol em um lance que a bola desviou no zagueiro e voltamos para o segundo tempo confiantes de que poder amos manter o que feito no primeiro tempo mas sofremos o gol de p nalti e depois a equipe se desorganizou um pouco
2747071 achei que merec amos arriscar um pouco mais e ca mos naquela armadilha que o gr mio usou durante todo o campeonato
2747072 o jogo seria dif cil de qualquer forma o gr mio o l der do campeonato um time que vem arrumado jogando junto h muito tempo e que tem sempre essa proposta de jogo de se fechar bem marcar forte e sair no contra ataque
2747073 patients may not be learning this information from their health care providers and information regarding colon cancer prevention is not as well publicized as it could be

2747075 sedentary people should first set such moderate achievable goals more benefits could accrue from higher levels and more intense exercise such as jogging running or tennis to some extent more may be better but it is important to note that a little is much better than nothing
2747076 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2747077 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2747078 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2747079 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2747080 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2747081 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2747082 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2747083 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2747084 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2747085 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2747086 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2747087 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2747088 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2747089 who are open to doing something on the production side
2747090 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2747091 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2747092 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2747093 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2747094 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2747095 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2747096 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2747097 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2747098 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2747099 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2747100 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2747101 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2747102 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

2747114 well dear when the board of supervisors wants to keep its 911 emergency call center fully funded it holds a public referendum during the next election requesting the voters to replace the emergency response fee of 2 75 per month per phone line with increasing rates for higher capacity lines with an access line tax of an equal amount should the voters approve this measure then the access line tax becomes law

2747127 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2747128 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands

2747144 as for your question about marriage it has been defined by human civilization for centuries as the union of one man and one woman
2747145 19and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah
2747146 34and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite
2747147 1now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite 2and he had two wives the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah and peninnah had children but hannah had no children
2747148 2of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave unto these in love 3and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart
2747149 they were a source of grief to isaac and rebekah
2747150 as solomon grew old his wives turned his heart after other gods and his heart was not fully devoted to the lord his god as the heart of david his father had been the lord became angry with solomon because his heart had turned away from the lord the god of israel who had appeared to him twice
2747151 these are but a few examples from your holy book depicting marriage that is definitely not
2747152 it has been defined by human civilization for centuries as the union of one man and one woman
2747153 has been defined by human civilization for centuries as the union of one man and one woman
2747154 defined by human civilization for centuries as the union of one man and one woman
2747155 any form of marriage other than one man and one woman has brought nothing more than strife and discord
2747156 has been defined by human civilization for centuries as the union of one man and one woman
2747157 de kristne hevder og har ogs klart gj re det til en allmenn oppfatning ogs blant ikke kristne at jesus virkelig har eksistert at det finnes uavhengige historiske beviser for hans eksistens
2747158 moderne kritiske metoder st tter ikke at jesus bare var en myte p standene om dette har igjen og igjen blitt besvart og avvist av de mest fremst ende forskere i de senere rene er det f om noen seri se historikere som har fors kt hevde at det ikke har v rt noen historisk jesus de som har pr vd seg p dette har ikke lykkes i bortforklare de sv rt mye sterkere til og med rikelige bevisene p det motsatte

2747166 experts agree that there is a high probability of another influenza pandemic occurring but it is impossible to forecast its exact timing or the precise nature of its impact
2747167 should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century
2747168 you might want to ask the question for example what happens if many of our heavy goods vehicle drivers fell victim to that influenza and werent able to perform their jobs
2747169 do we have enough back up to be able for example to deliver food to the supermarkets
2747170 i have great faith in the public and they would prefer to have information because the thing that causes fear is ignorance of things
2747171 what we have is the sense of real slippage that well you know it may not be 2010 and it probably will be 2015 as if that doesnt matter
2747172 any woman who said giving birth didnt hurt is lying and then when she says but when i saw the babys face it made it all worthwhile shes also lying
2747173 i think it did destroy her life my mum wanted to be a dancer
2747174 i want to be with my friends im drunk i want to phone my mum
2747175 i think people will see that i really did invent some kind of language
2747176 why arent they saying it about picasso van gogh egon schiele picasso made work about women all the women he had sex with it was his women his collection of women or youve got great artists such as matisse who actually shook hands with the nazis hung out with the vichy regime and painted beautiful interiors so what do people want
2747177 im an artist and i make art about me so i have to be its my fuel
2747178 if youve ever been brought up poor without food without heating without plimsolls with holes in things with no christmas presents or christmas you do not ever want to have children to be in that situation
2747179 a few months ago i got very scared about the idea of dying alone getting old alone because not many people do it they have families
2747180 maybe men think one of me is enough they dont want to take any more on
2747181 every day im writing it off im adjusting to not having them i knew it would do my head in around the time and also i got pissed off because im quite a good woman so i was thinking but im obviously not good enough to have someones children its pretty irritating never have been no ones ever wanted me to
2747182 is that you can do what the f k you like but i dont want to do what the f k i like i can do anything i can travel around the world i can stay up all night drinking i dont have to answer to anyone but i dont want to be like that anyway
2747183 i do all the charity work and sometimes i question the whole big scheme of things how does it all work whats it all for if i was a grandmother id have this other kind of arc where things go but i dont have an arc the only thing i have is me
2747184 it makes me feel more useful because at least ive got something moving
2747185 theres a lot of men that would give up everything to be in my position to have the success that i have
2747186 its like a faustian pact theyd swap their wife their children everything theyre so desperate for that success
2747187 and im not like that my art is just like kind of its what i do and the success of it is on top of it and really brilliant but theres this other side of me that i dont know whether ill ever know whether ill be able to explore which will always just have to be suppressed and pushed down
2747188 ive never done bungee jumping or jumped out of an airplane but i think it might be comparable to that
2747189 there isnt as much disposable income as there was and people are feeling concerned about paying mortgages
2747190 entertainment seems to be one of the first things that goes in a household budget
2747191 doubtless the hiding place of a gang of counterfeiters if not of more terrible enemies of human happiness
2747192 it may be somewhat freaky but does that make it murder no
2747193 we are creating an atmosphere of tension in the country and there is danger ahead of us there is also an added danger of creating a conducive atmosphere for coup makers to justify the seizure of power
2747194 in a situation where both parties are organising buses to transport people across constituencies to register to vote and also encourage the registration of minors is a real threat to our democracy
2747195 the lapses of the ec and the actions of the political parties are indeed threatening the democratic processes in this country and this is providing a platform for coup makers to take over power
2747196 this do and die attitude of both the npp and ndc is creating a major problem for the nation and i think this is not healthy for our nation it is because of this and other reasons that the dfp was born to rescue the situation the dfp is offering a peaceful government to ghanaians
2747197 to avoid the confusion the electorate should vote for the dfp in the 2008 general elections the dfp does not believe in insults attacks and intimidations because we think that insults do not bring food onto the table
2747198 at the age of 18 you will go and pay once for life premium and that is all you would not have to renew it every year
2747199 bead selling is a big business the authorities are refusing to develop the structures
2747200 that bead trading is the main thing that brings tourists to koforidua and a potential source for the development of cultural artefacts in the region to benefit the people
2747201 i want government to build for bead and other art sellers a place we can call our own a beads market not just a market
2747202 this is their house and we will be happy to receive them

2747227 there would be very few observers in the marketplace that would say to you coles and woolworths are not vigorously competing against each other
2747228 the grocery market is workably competitive that term is used to describe a market in which competition exists but it is definitely not as competitive as it should be
2747229 when i use a word it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
2747230 a significant number of consumers do use the prices of specific items to choose the grocery store they will visit
2747231 the majority of consumers either compare prices on a limited range of products shortly before visiting the store or compare prices over a longer period of time
2747232 five days after last years change of government on november 29 2007 the new attorney general robert mcclelland expressed his governments support for the enactment of a statutory bill of rights
2747233 it is interesting that the government has elected not to pursue a constitutionally entrenched bill of rights such as that in the us i suspect the governments reluctance to go down this path has more to do with the political reality of achieving constitutional change in australia rather than sound and considered constitutional policy on behalf of the federal government
2747234 what proponents of a bill or charter of rights in australia have to date failed to establish is why australia needs a bill of rights
2747235 in the view of the opposition there is no case for the enactment of a bill or charter of rights in the absence of any demonstrated need for one that view is not as i have said a partisan one
2747236 by enactment of a bill of rights which makes those rights as justiciable the parliament is transferring the responsibility to define and give meaning to those abstract rights to un elected judges who are not best suited to exercising that discretion
2747237 speaking extra judicially nsw chief justice spigelman describes the rights compliant provision in the uk human rights act as a substantial change in the relationship between parliament and the judiciary
2747238 he identifies a conundrum whereby the intention of parliament expressed in section 3 of the human rights act is applied to override the intention of parliament at the time that the other legislation including subsequent legislation is enacted
2747239 parliaments are the proper institutions under our system to decide what rights should be further developed or qualified by competing interests
2747240 parliaments are elected to make laws in doing so they make judgments about how the rights and interests of the public should be balanced views will differ in any given case about whether the judgment is correct however if the decision in unacceptable the community can make its views known at regular elections this is our political tradition a bill of rights would pose a fundamental shift in that tradition
2747241 if we are to enumerate those abstract rights which we value today as the most popular or favourable then what of the rights that exist but are omitted
2747242 if we are to reduce abstract ideas down to a series of short lines on the statute books then we limit their meaning
2747243 every person has a right to life and has the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of life
2747244 everyone has the right to life in particular no one may be deprived of life
2747245 this section applies to a person from the time of birth
2747246 does an unborn baby fall within the definition of every person under the victorian charter does the acts act by expressly making the right contingent upon being born deprive that soon to be born child a right to life
2747247 is that australia does not have a bill of rights because it has never felt the need of one that fact alone demonstrates the strength of our protection of rights and liberties not its weakness
2747248 where the public culture is inhospitable to the rights of the individual no amount of grandiose language will change it and bills of rights become meaningless constitutional baubles as the nazi bill of rights which guaranteed
2747249 undertake an australia wide inquiry to determine how best to recognise and protect human rights and responsibilities
2747250 the election is a reminder to all of us in politics that the australian people will hold us accountable and this is an important lesson for all sides of politics particularly those of us who are currently in government
2747251 the decision was a very courageous one its clear from the vote that we have seen the arguments fell on deaf ears
2747252 one view would be that people thought we dont want this election were not prepared to vote for the other mob so we just wont vote i suspect theres an element about people being cranky on calling an election one year early
2747253 kevin rudd promised to end the so called blame game and this has exposed the incompetence of labor governments across australia and voters have reacted by delivering large swings against labor at every opportunity
2747254 i dont know that id say generally the tides turning against labor
2747255 its always been hard for labor to win the northern territory just as in western australia my own state im expecting a tough and tight election in western australia im confident that well win
2747256 they understand fully all the implications of our federal system so i dont draw too much into the northern territory result and i wont draw too much from the west australian result other than to say we know it will be a tough election
2747257 what i see is an opportunity to build a momentum that if handled properly will start to take the bark off labor in a number of states and territories
2747258 the territory result was entirely unexpected from all sides there would however be a sense of foreboding for premier alan carpenter in western australia here it is not simply the beginning of the end of labor in states and territories its about the beginning of morale and momentum for opposition parties
2747259 i dont think federal issues played any part at all in this campaign
2747260 its about america its values we are a freedom loving nation that is right now under attack
2747261 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2747262 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2747263 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2747264 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2747265 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2747266 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2747267 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2747268 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2747293 fannie and freddies decision to curtail support of the mortgage market is going to make mortgages more expensive for potential home buyers which is going to hurt the overall economy
2747294 theyre the only real buyers in this market and theyre going to buy less thats really bad news
2747295 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
2747296 the crisis that we all observe as we drive home everyday continues to strain our results and capital and were still in that dark tunnel
2747297 the government has done a lot to help these companies but mortgage rates are continuing to rise and the housing market is continuing to decline
2747298 theyve already become part of the problem because the government has to worry about them instead of relying on them to save everyone
2747299 the government wanted its bailout plan to be strong enough to calm the markets but not so strong that theyre forced to use it
2747300 but so far its only been partially effective its stabilized the companies but hasnt done anything to help the costs of new mortgages go down
2747301 financial markets look considerably perkier than a few weeks ago
2747302 their recovery has been helped by a softer oil price encouraging a revival in risk appetite
2747303 the inflation beast remains a threat but we are confident that it can be caged in the developed economies at least
2747304 so we keep our small overweight to equities and are guardedly optimistic about the future reckoning on a semblance of normality returning to markets

2747322 if you have done what you need to do to make sure you are well equipped and prepared to deal with a hurricane strike we have done our job
2747323 i would strongly urge those who havent done so already to make preparations this weekend in order not to have to rush and prepare once you have been notified to do so
2747324 for the past two weeks i and or the office of disaster management have been informing the st
2747325 time and time again we have had the experience and have been taught to be prepared and dont wait until the last minute to gather items together because then it would have already been too late prepare early in order for you and your family to be able to ride out the storm in a safe manner
2747326 prepare early and avoid being caught unprepared preparedness starts with every one of us within society as a community we must plan early and dont wait until the last moment to rush to get things done because it can result in injury
2747327 he encourages the two parties to continue to move ahead with implementation of the remaining road map provisions so that those displaced by mays fighting can soon return in safety and dignity to resume their lives in a secure environment
2747328 i urge arab countries to send soldiers peacekeepers to somalia and to take part in un efforts to withdraw ethiopian troops from somalia
2747329 they suspected we were out to inspect their motorbikes and to ask for riding permits
2747330 we dont want you to think that we are your enemies we want you to get closer to the police to know what we want with regard to keeping traffic laws and to work together for the safety of all boda boda users and yourselves
2747331 i give you only one week to make sure that you all have number plates after that we shall impound all bikes without number plates
2747332 this is unacceptable and executive budget should be cut to restore sanity in service delivery to our people
2747333 we therefore recommend that measures be instituted in the budgetary process to reduce these imbalances and weakness in budgetary allocations
2747334 there are no funds to facilitate the judiciary to fight the backlog of cases yet many prisons across the country are over congested
2747335 the executive is the implementers of government programmes and if we are giving this arm more resources this is specifically for implementation to ease service delivery
2747336 if this money can reach the beneficiaries there would no complaints
2747337 for parliament and judiciary we can talk about it in fact as the budget committee we have already recommended that judiciary budget be increased to at least 5 per cent of the national budget and parliament should get 2 per cent to streamline service delivery
2747338 parliament cannot play its roles because of financial constraints and this has promoted corruption in the country because there is no enough monitoring of government activities
2747339 we can mourn the whole day and night but we cannot create resources which we dont have
2747340 our resource envelope is small and if you dont agree with the government plan to create employment then we can discuss to amend the order of priorities
2747341 millions of people in these 12 countries are on the margins of survival because of the combination of drought crop failure and rising fuel and food prices
2747342 the cerf has been an integral part of the emergency response to the global food crisis
2747343 this is an acceptable we cant allow this to happen let them vote in my absence how can all key posts of a national party go to one tribe
2747344 once you play tribal politics in an already multi tribal society what do you expect you destroy villages and families
2747345 2008 is a year where we have become more divided it is going to throw the country into chaos this should worry ugandans
2747346 that capacity is got from their geographical regions this builds tension
2747347 kinsmen as an obligation to his lineage group in return for which he gets his individual rights
2747348 tribe means a group of people speaking a common language observing uniform rules of social organisation and working together for common purposes
2747349 tribalism has come to mean the exclusion of the majority from enjoyment of goodies and the promotion of the interests of a particular group defined by reference to tribe or lineage
2747350 what we are seeing has been built over the years the only difference is that there are now parties which are a platform for almost anyone
2747351 the problem is those people who think that elections are right only when they are the ones elected that is why we have so many small parties there are those who cannot even think of being anything other than party presidents
2747352 not everybody can be a prime minister a vice president a minister
2747353 if say a muganda should take the position chairmanship the next question will be which muganda the buganda caucus said the position should be filled by beti kamya if that demand were to be placed before a national council muslims would say she maybe a muganda but she is not a muslim
2747354 if you fill that position with a muslim and there is no catholic the catholics would say what about us all these are realities which have been created over the years by sectarian incitement of people for political support these are factors that we must deal with
2747355 not at all this should be stopped politics is a win win game it is choosing leaders on merit that will develop this country and we live in harmony
2747356 i urge the people of banadir mogadishu region to support peace
2747357 the issue of condoms which are very fundamental have been left out completely the money goes to churches but unfortunately this money has specifically been designed for what i would call moralistic behavior and so i am not surprised that there is an upsurge of hiv in this country
2747358 i have been a preacher for 33 years now so when i believed jesus and when i started reading the bible i knew that jesus said go into the whole world and preach the gospel and also heal the sick in my name we pray for the sick people some of them get healed and some dont and if they dont get healed we refer them to hospital you cant impose healing on some body if some body doesnt get healed where does he go to the hospital
2747359 there is a group especially from the american community who has been funding initiatives that are basically faith based in approach
2747360 the aids commission still promotes abc as a strategy in fact we are talking of abc plus because there are new initiatives that have come on board like medical male circumcisions like anti retroviral therapy like increased voluntary counseling and testing and empowerment of women
2747361 people in the communities are still having a lot of problems people are still dying even if drugs are there there is not sufficient education about these drugs and so the problems are still very big many other people have come in religious institutions come in others says they can heal hiv others have become very condemnatory you find these new sects saying people should not use condoms that condoms are not accepted and they should not even be promoted there are what i would call conflicting messages that are going around
2747362 we already have a collection of ideas from the grassroots we can no longer plan anything at the national level without getting the involvement of the local communities at the end of the day that is where the majority of our people live
2747363 i received a telephone call last night thursday telling me i was the next to die
2747364 we will not give up we will not let the insecurity prevent us from helping somali people who are in urgent need of aid
2747365 it seems there is an anti aid worker campaign going on in the afgoye area it looks like the attackers want the aid workers expelled from the region for insecurity to reign
2747366 kariye was one of those who organised the protests over the increase in attacks on aid workers he may have become a target as a result
2747367 all parties to this conflict have an obligation under international law to protect civilians and to refrain from indiscriminate attacks
2747368 yet it seems at every turn the death toll of ordinary somalis is growing far too many of them are women children or aid workers who have no part in this conflict
2747369 the death of tens of civilians in bomb and mortar attacks in mogadishu in the past week the current massive displacement of civilians due to fighting in beletweyne and the latest killing of an aid worker underline the toll conflict is taking on civilian populations and the relief operation
2747370 all this is occurring in the context of a severely deteriorating humanitarian situation in which aid workers themselves subject to attacks in increasing numbers are more and more challenged to reach people with the assistance they require
2747371 the humanitarian situation has deteriorated steadily in the 18 months that i have been emergency relief coordinator
2747372 and has now reached unprecedented desperate levels even in the context of somalia over the last 18 years

2747375 secondly is the fear of going without food and clothes
2747376 the bad thing is that we are always chased and beaten by government and municipal police
2747377 also when we sleep our things can get stolen its not a safe place for us
2747378 i struggle to find food but theres nothing i can do about the beatings
2747379 we are aware there has been an influx of street children in the town since the post election violence but allegations that police beat up such children are false
2747380 when they the children breach the law all we do is arrest them and hand them over to the childrens department
2747381 we have seen a considerable rise in the number of separated and unaccompanied children as a result of the post election violence throughout the rift valley
2747382 most of these children risk being thrown out on to the streets
2747383 i have so many friends we all look after each other
2747384 we sell these used boxes and scrap metal which we recover from peoples rubbish to buy a little food and glue
2747385 i take it so i feel high and so i can forget
2747386 in general the findings of the assessment indicated that the overall food security situation in the drought affected areas has not improved
2747387 failed rains in the south in october and november during the belg season led to crop failure
2747388 we are trying to address the problem with the available resources but we still need donor support
2747389 rwanda is a sovereign state and we have got all the capacity to do what is important for us the commission is composed of a team of experts the commission of inquiry was as a result of public demand mainly rwandans but also some members of the international community who wanted to know exactly what happened during the 1994 genocide and who was responsible
2747390 besides these crimes were carried out against the rwandan people and it would be unreasonable to underestimate the capacity of the rwandans
2747391 the report should be judged according to its content before anybody can dismiss the report they should first look at its content we expect the french government to take the report in positive light and cooperate with our government
2747392 informacion a mitad del pasillo de la sala de espera
2747393 we are aware that crude prices have dropped but we cant shock the market by responding immediately
2747394 what we do we watch any changes if they grow into a sustainable trend then we respond accordingly in this case if the crude prices continue downward we no doubt cut pump prices
2747395 world oil prices have gone up and in uganda the oil prices have to go up too there is nothing we can do about that and everyone will put his price for the products depending on the cost incurred there is no science about it
2747396 the master plan would involve at its core the expedited implementation of regional projects and programmes under the lake victoria basin commission in among others the roads lake transport tourism fisheries and agricultural sectors
2747397 we were told at a meeting of chef de missions delegation leaders today that we should all expect a very big surprise
2747398 everything has been excellent so far we are all now anxious to see how far they can go at the opening ceremony
2747399 following the three rehearsals we can now declare to you quite solidly that the opening ceremony for the games is ready
2747400 they would say and fannie mae and freddie mac were part of it this is a complex global market if you start interfering with the free flow of money then georgia will become an island that has no credit i kept telling them youre in for a crash here
2747401 fight first and then make pleas for sympathy to our cause to the international community

2747412 renting office accommodation is a source of arrears and fraud during negotiations
2747413 this business of renting government offices is not sustainable as billions are spent every year on rent yet we can build government offices
2747414 we cannot go like this we need to take action and spend this money which is being wasted to other gainful ventures
2747415 we cannot afford seeing government agencies as squatters on private land because we are paying dearly
2747416 we have already recommended that ministry of finance allocates shs20 billion in the budget every financial year to build government offices and this is our stand we want to see this money

2747418 the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all of the stages that i have to become a u s citizen
2747419 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american seeing my fellow americans coming behind me in the opening ceremony and supporting me will be a great honor the highest honor
2747420 in many ways the opening ceremony sets the tone for the two weeks of competition and celebration that will follow
2747421 we addressed our issues to the chairperson of council but we have not received any communication from him instead we are just reading in newspapers that the university will be opening as planned muasas position still remains even if they open lecturers will not teach
2747422 whereas the universities and other tertiary institutions act 2001 section 68 1 provides for the establishment of academic staff associations the law does not bestow on them immunities of a registered organisation as stipulated by section 24 of the labour union act no7 2006
2747423 this letter is to draw your attention to the fact that the associations have no mandate to call for industrial action that would be illegal the leaders of academic associations should be accordingly advised to comply with the laws of the land
2747424 article 29 1 of the constitution assures all ugandans of the freedom of association which shall include the freedom to form and join associations or unions including trade unions political and other civic organisation no person can be forced to join or belong to an association or union thus the choice to unionise or not lies wholly with academic staff members who will make such a decision without coercion or undue pressure from management
2747425 we would like to emphasize that muasas right of association and academic freedom cannot be overridden by the state less so council
2747426 am not muasa and please dont ask me about muasa
2747427 that the appointing authority be advised that the conduct of mr kimunya is not compatible with that of a cabinet minister
2747428 this is a very brave statement there is somebody attempting to subvert the work of the finance committee and if they will not allow it to be tabled i will call a press conference next tuesday and read the report publicly
2747429 i cannot bend the rules of the house even for the president prime minister vice president or the chairman of a house committee
2747430 the chair speaker marende made a ruling that it be tabled today and we are seeking your indulgence to table it
2747431 the mistake you are referring to is not by mr okemo but by the clerk and we fear that this urgent matter will not be tabled because we are going on recess
2747432 the deputy speaker did something unusual and i can assure you that farah maalim did not complain of not seeing the report the deputy speaker cooked up some ruling to protect somebody
2747433 it is unusual for the deputy speaker to raise such issues which are normally raised by mps
2747434 when you dont create things you become defined by your tastes rather than ability your tastes only narrow amp exclude people so create

2747436 i had to disband the mobile police patrol unit and put in completely new people they had become criminals waylaying lorries carrying charcoal instead of fighting crime this is what i have been saying but i was crucified because i want a clean up
2747437 attacked me that i am from the outside that i dont know problems inside the police
2747438 but we are now investigating backwards we want to know his background
2747439 why have they been quiet they knew it but allowed police to groom a viper
2747440 i think its the end of his road in police
2747441 i dont want to prejudice the investigations but certainly he will be dismissed i dont see anybody tolerating that he is going to be prosecuted
2747442 we have been receiving complaints against the police from the public some of them have been charged
2747443 in principle uganda can still file a formal inter party request for the icc to withdraw from a case under article 19 of the rome statute which established the court
2747444 however she said a state party like uganda under the icc has only one opportunity to apply for the international court to withdraw from a case it has already investigated and set to try the suspects
2747445 uganda would have to get right its first application to be allowed to try kony and his commanders
2747446 the government would convince the icc that it is now willing and committed to using its local courts system to try the lra
2747447 government will have to convince and persuade the court icc it has sufficient infrastructure to handle these serious cases
2747448 theyd rather pay out the crooks than pay out their workers

2747458 fort greene based critic charles taylors essay in dissent headlined is notable in that it connects glazers critique directly to atlantic yards just as glazer has done so in public presentations albeit not in the text

2747474 i am no longer the person described in the first few pages of this chapter and i am forever grateful for that i would never want to go back to that life a sheltered narrow existence fueled by fear and made livable by insulation isolation and self indulgence it was a life lived in a bubble but bubbles being the most fragile constructions are easily destroyed all it takes is a little finger

2747482 from the outset climate camp organisers have indicated that the actions they will take part in will be peaceful and will ensure the safety of both coal workers and participants in the actions it is an extreme overreaction of the police to deploy the riot squad water police dog squad and mounted police the real criminals in this scenario are the coal companies and the nsw government who are enabling the coal companies to continue fuelling climate change through coal exports
2747483 i note that the climate camp itinerary includes activities for children i certainly hope you are not going to be so irresponsible as to include any children in this activity such a stupid act sets a bad enough example fro children as it is
2747484 from watching the news last night it looked very much like the average bunch of rabid greenies to me

2747539 so he comes over to me and he holds them up right beside me
2747540 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2747541 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2747542 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2747543 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2747544 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2747545 mccain obviously took time to determine first that russia had indeed attacked georgia before demanding restraint from the victim its apparent that mccain has a better grasp of the situation and understood its ramifications as events unfolded obama issued a boilerplate statement that generically demanded that everyone start getting along and had to modify his stance as his 300 foreign policy advisers had a chance to tutor him on the conflict
2747546 id rather vote for the man who gets it right and has spent years studying foreign affairs warfare and american strategic needs than the man who makes it up as he goes along mccain is right this was a 3 am moment and obama proved himself unprepared and unsuited to answer the call

2747549 no we never made sonny bill williams an offer in 2004
2747550 i remember it well because sonny was at the height of his powers that year
2747551 we had had some initial discussions with williams management but we certainly hadnt put an offer to him and if we had it wouldve been nowhere near the amounts now being bandied about
2747552 to be honest we havent given him a second thought and were getting used to it anyway whenever a big name comes off contract it seems st helens always gets thrown into the mix
2747553 mate theres actually a few of us trying to get our hands on it now
2747554 we reckon it might be worth a bit one day
2747555 no we never made sonny bill williams an offer in 2004
2747556 i remember it well because sonny was at the height of his powers that year
2747557 operations of this sort that involve the nsw police force and community are important in ensuring that people can enjoy themselves in a safe drug free environment
2747558 it is also good to ensure that we have stopped such dangerous addictive drugs from being distributed to juveniles as well as the general community and we are very pleased to have had the co operation of the general community it is a very pleasing result
2747559 alcohol and drugs are most often the cause behind it
2747560 i have been working in the city for 10 years so i have experienced and seen a lot there wouldnt be an officer who hasnt been abused or attacked
2747561 there just seems to be a lack of respect from this generation x
2747562 i dont think people who are perpetuating this will take any notice of a campaign they need to be shown they can go to jail if they assault or abuse an officer
2747563 the last thing they should have to deal with is abuse and threatening behaviour
2747564 the northern territory election is a reminder to all of us in politics that the australian people will hold us accountable and this is an important lesson for all sides of politics particularly those of us who are currently in government
2747565 its failed to live up to those expectations and they will be punished
2747566 state and territory labor governments were getting away with gross mismanagement by blaming the howard government for their own failings
2747567 the conservatives in the northern territory are coming off a very low base so in many respects the only way was up
2747568 the iemma government has to meet its obligations to fund public schools or we are going to see unacceptable levels of corporate intrusion into our schools as seen in america
2747569 the department has set up an infrastructure working party including the school principal and members of the school community to develop a four year master plan for the school and to explore the communitys ideas
2747570 councils officers have been made aware that the ministry of transport is undertaking a project brief for the feasibility of the west metro rail line between sydney cbd and parramatta
2747571 council has received verbal advice from the ministry that the proposed feasibility study does not extend beyond parramatta correspondence has been sent to mot raising concerns the project brief does not reflect the urban transport statement position and that the brief should be extended to penrith
2747572 we are extremely disappointed the study will not include penrith a regional city and an area already critically underserviced by public transport nor will it include any suburb west of parramatta in its current format it is an inner west study
2747573 an unsolicited proposal to government for a western fast rail is currently under consideration with a decision to be made shortly
2747574 theres heaps of us on the train each day theres obviously demand for travel to the city
2747575 i was screaming get out at him and he was saying things to me but it all happened so fast i cant remember what he was saying at my age you dont need these things
2747576 kim was in the hallway she was hysterical she was screaming the police think thats why he left that maybe he was sacred off by all the noise
2747577 ive lived here for 58 years and its never happened before id never had any experiences like this weve never even had a break in
2747578 to me its just internal bickering to try and do the liberal party harm they are completely false allegations
2747579 anonymous correspondence was forwarded to the department of premier and cabinet for advice on the appropriate course of action
2747580 a letter advising of this action was also sent to the email address which had sent the correspondence
2747581 we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates
2747582 but if interest rates were to fall then we would expect the banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2747583 lets give people the chance to move their bank accounts if theyre not satisfied with the service theyre getting
2747584 we have a postal vote system designed to increase participation in democracy but it operates at the expense of democracy
2747585 it prevents some people exercising their right to vote to make a fair uncoerced choice in private
2747586 as soon as the postal vote arrives in the home family members find themselves placed under pressure to fill in their vote in the presence of the male head of the family who has promised the votes in his household to a particular party
2747587 this system has brought shame on our city it corrupts politics within asian communities and undermines the faith in the democratic process
2747588 i told him the law needed to be much firmer if they want to ensure the individuals vote was to be safeguarded
2747589 the government is committed to ensuring that people have confidence in the electoral system
2747590 were now in the volatile time band between the august 1 solar eclipse and the august 16 lunar eclipse
2747591 regardless of when they sign up they get a job
2747592 in order to run a successful program youve got to have parameters
2747593 you cant continue to add to the program and expect it to go off like clockwork
2747594 the idea of enrolling as many teens as possible and then figuring out how to pay for it violates the basic principles of budgeting deciding how much to spend and then sticking with it
2747595 influence the political climate like never before in this novembers historical presidential election
2747596 i told ebay that all 50 states have similar laws on selling your vote
2747597 i suggested that as it gets closer to the election more people might try to do this
2747598 it does pain me to allow something that has been abused by certain folks to let that go on another year
2747599 in my mind things have been broken for a while and its about time we fixed the problem
2747600 a supreme court justice has a daughter or daughter in law i forget that lives here he was visiting his grandbaby a few years ago and hen came to our town to speak
2747601 we should have paid more attention when we started to have suspicion that something just wasnt right
2747602 literally you could have someone using a diploma in an extremely harmful way if they are not properly trained
2747603 i think this is a real wake up call to people who think diploma mills are a small problem
2747604 diploma mills are a huge problem they are an international problem it doesnt matter where they are operating from
2747605 if the question is asked would you like slots within two miles of your house the outcome might well be different
2747606 as a matter of psychology i think most of us value investors think we have plenty enough bargains already and may not be able to handle that many more
2747607 until the values can be defined i think youre somewhat taking your life into your hands
2747608 a lot of value investors went into financials in the spring and theyre now getting killed
2747609 a small portion of our losses will not be recovered we underestimated the speed and severity of credit deterioration and overestimated some companies ability to cope with credit and liquidity problems
2747610 our mission is to provide free and culturally appropriate health care to the latino community
2747611 i understand that we need to create structures and systems as we grow but it is sensitivity to clients that makes this place so special
2747612 we were created to help a population that fled from the trauma of civil wars and crossing borders the idea was not to cause more trauma or put up more barriers we have to modernize but without losing the essence of what we are this is my great fear
2747613 in addition to continuing the existing order against naked short selling the commission will continue exploring other remedies for the broader marketplace to further protect investors from distort and short artists
2747614 we look forward to put in place new authorities to improve confidence and stability in markets and to provide better oversight for fannie mae and freddie mac
2747615 the oddity of the situation is if the debt is backed by the government then it might be impossible to imagine how the companies might ever fail
2747616 at the moment a bottom for the housing market is not visible
2747617 corporate depositors and individual depositors are looking at balances at individual financial institutions i think thats unsettling some of the banks
2747618 an update on where the economy is and where its going
2747619 not there to tell bernanke how to do his job
2747620 the two men agreed that washington must restore confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac in a way that protects the taxpayer and our financial system and that we must reform and modernize our regulatory structure to avoid these problems in the future and protect average americans
2747621 regularly consults with a range of experts including bernanke and paulson and has done so for years
2747622 theres a growing sense that what we saw out of merrill lynch is the beginning of the end for the financial cleanup
2747623 as a state we have made great strides in protecting maryland homeowners from foreclosure but we can and we must do more
2747624 todays agreement will give prince georges county another tool to help distressed homeowners and will help sustain homeowners through these difficult times
2747625 the way we weather the storm is by pulling together
2747626 no county should have to go it alone no homeowner should have to go it alone
2747627 its one of the hardest races and id like to try other events
2747628 the event starts to hurt halfway through it so for him to do what he does after that last turn and go that fast its pretty much inhuman
2747629 reflects the olympic spirit and the value of the games
2747630 for the olympics unfortunately this is not a big deal
2747631 when its individual against individual you probably wrestled against the guy before in the european championships or the world championships
2747632 you dont see him as a russian who invaded your country you see him as a guy who beat me 3 2 last time
2747633 until dogs and cats can go on the pill or wear condoms we need to help them practice safe sexby spaying and neutering millions of homeless animals are turned in to shelters every year because there simply arent enough good homes for them all the answer is easy as abc animal birth control which means get fido and fluffy fixed

2747642 this was supposed to have been an enjoyable event but it rapidly turned to tragedy as one of the party got into difficulties after deciding to go for a swim in atrocious sea conditions
2747643 members of the public entering the sea in these sort of conditions were putting themselves at severe risk no matter how commendable were their intentions
2747644 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2747645 sometimes they were so full of people that they put people in the trunks of cars
2747646 i wondered what was going on so i called the state authorities
2747647 human pawns in a scheme by hospitals doctors ambulance companies and others to defraud
2747648 red white and blue let it do what it do

2747650 these allegations involve individuals in a complex arrangement involving shell companies kickbacks bogus contracts with the people committing fraud and hospitals covering up kickbacks
2747651 and i went with them to the hospital they treated me for my arthritis
2747652 they come down every morning with four or five people they fill up their van and take them to the hospital
2747653 when they come back they give them money sometimes as much as 150 or 200
2747654 indeed on a year ended basis cpi inflation might rise further before it starts to come down particularly given the recent further surge in global oil prices beyond what we assumed in our may projections he said during a speech in sydney
2747655 you shouldnt be waiting until its really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where wed like it to be before you can conclude you ve got to start doing something before that day mr stevens said
2747656 just as you shouldnt be tightening before the day that inflation really gets going
2747657 i dont want to comment on some particular outcome or indicate a decision
2747658 the effects of that will be working against the expansionary forces from the terms of trade and the broader pressures on inflation from high resource utilisation he said
2747659 inevitably there is a lot of uncertainty about how these opposing forces will net out
2747660 but the forecast we released in our may 2008 statement on monetary policy was that the net result would be a significant slowing in demand and output growth this year

2747687 in all of southeast asia travelers coming back to the united states with medical complaints typically have either experienced a viral syndrome fever respiratory infection animal bites or scratches or diarrhea
2747688 results from a recent stud completed during a 10 year period showed that people who traveled especially to beijing were commonly afflicted with respiratory infections and animal bites
2747689 in the united states in 2006 there were three cases of human rabies two from bats and one from a dog bite in the philippines
2747690 in the same year there were more than 3 000 human deaths from rabies in china alone in china health professionals use a rabies immune globulin that is not approved by the world health organization who anyone bit by a rabid animal needs more than just a vaccine they need immune globulin to protect them during the window of time before the vaccine take effect
2747691 since the olympic games last for several weeks many people have not yet traveled to china
2747692 it is never too late to take necessary precautions travelers to china need updated routine immunizations hepatitis a and typhoid shots

2747700 given all the questions about gardasil the best public health policy would be to reevaluate its safety and to prohibit its distribution to minors in the least governments should rethink any efforts to mandate or promote this vaccine for children
2747701 and dont go plunking yourselves down in front of the tv
2747702 i felt my mouth fall open gaping my eyes bugged out and my entire posture
2747703 i felt that i looked like a short haired blonde elly patterson my short hair was even trying 2 arrange itself in2 a bun which it cdnt but it tried
2747704 i dont want 2 scare u but that whole thing u described thats xxactly how mom wda dealt w the situation
2747705 really deanna if u objected 2 all the things u knew yr children wd want 2 do y didnt u just tell them sumthing u didnt object 2

2747712 well at least now i can say ive been with a pornstar and you fuck better than her
2747713 a close look at john mccains senate voting record on judicial confirmations makes it painfully clear that progressives need to ignore the rantings of the ann coulter crowd and believe john mccain when he
2747714 indeed one looks in vain for a judge who is too ideologically conservative for mccain he voted to confirm robert bork clarence thomas and unless ive missed something every other republican judicial nominee voted on in his 22 years in the senate
2747715 even more tellingly as part of his negotiation in 2005 of what has been dubbed the
2747716 no one thinks john mccain would nominate ethically challenged judges but there is every reason to think that he will nominate ideological conservatives to the supreme court and lower federal courts
2747717 this is important because federal courts are already dominated by republican appointees seven of the nine justices and a sizeable majority of lower federal court judges were appointed by republican presidents with the courts liberal moderate judges on average 15 years older than the courts conservatives john mccain in the white house could easily deliver the court to the right wing for a generation

2747723 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
2747724 the surge has succeeded yet senator obama commits a grave error by insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
2747725 what is missing is the judgment of a commander in chief
2747726 first he opposed the surge and then he confidently predicted it would fail and then he tried to prevent funding for the troops that carried out the surge
2747727 i only wanted to get some cookies whats wrong with that
2747728 hell whatcha ya need to do is some push ups
2747729 we didnt think there would be anything other than the normal questions but there was

2747735 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2747736 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2747737 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2747738 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2747739 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2747740 my argument has always been that if youre going to have preschool its not inappropriate for the state to set some minimum standards
2747741 it should always be up to the parent to decide if the child will participate
2747742 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2747743 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2747744 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2747756 hes never known anything else here in hawaii the proportion of women working outside the home has always been high
2747757 theyre not pretentious his grandmothers lived in the same two bedroom apartment for 40 years they never drove fancy cars they chose to put their resources into education and travel their success was based on intellect and hard work grandparents who sacrificed its the american story
2747758 the work ethic she gave me was if you want to get ahead you work hard and you work wise

2747813 sedangkan sebelum ini kita mendengar banyak surat layang berkaitan penyelewengan dilakukan menteri menteri tidak pula disiasat bahkan mungkin tidak dipedulikan pihak berkenaan
2747814 acap kali kita mendengar menteri yang terbabit rasuah seperti pernah disiarkan akhbar tiada siapa yang peduli pun tetapi kalau membabitkan pemimpin kerajaan negeri bpr mari dan terus siasat

2747819 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2747820 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2747821 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2747822 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2747823 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2747827 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2747828 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2747829 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2747830 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2747831 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2747832 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2747833 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2747834 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2747835 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2747836 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2747837 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2747838 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2747839 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2747840 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2747841 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2747842 consorts both in throne and grave here we rest two sisters elizabeth and mary in hope of our resurrection
2747843 my loving people we have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety to take heed how we commit ourself to armed multitudes for fear of treachery but i assure you i do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people i know i have the body but of a weak and feeble woman but i have the heart and stomach of a king and of a king of england too and think foul scorn that parma or spain or any prince of europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm
2747844 my lords the law of nature moves me to sorrow for my sister the burden that is fallen upon me makes me amazed and yet considering i am gods creature ordained to obey his appointment i will thereto yield desiring from the bottom of my heart that i may have assistance of his grace to be the minister of his heavenly will in this office now committed to me and as i am but one body naturally considered though by his permission a body politic to govern so shall i desire you all to be assistant to me that i with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to almighty god and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth i mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel
2747845 i will have here but one mistress and no master
2747846 there is only one christ jesus one faith all else is a dispute over trifles
2747847 i have already joined myself in marriage to a husband namely the kingdom of england
2747848 i have no desire to make windows into mens souls
2747849 if only elizabeth and mary could have married each other
2747850 i have to say personally for me i have alot of admiration for elizabeth but not for mary i think elizabeth was all round a a better woman and queen on the other hand we dont really know the truth of anything it was so long ago mary just seemed to make mistake after mistake and i find it quite irritating then again would i have been much better
2747851 i think we are going to stay in this range until we see more conviction of the fed funds rate
2747852 i dont see any reasons for the fed to hike or cut rates yet
2747853 what you are seeing is a very cautious consumer and so they should be people just dont have enough money because of food and energy prices
2747854 rates are going to go higher the only question is when
2747855 whats changed is the market is re pricing foreign economies its not so much dollar strength
2747856 i think weak retail numbers could insight short term selling but ultimately the excessive deterioration of fundamentals abroad will overwhelm that
2747857 i think markets will remember fridays employment and next week we will see a hang over affect
2747858 but i just dont see a lot of data saving the canadian dollar
2747859 our tasking today was to come out and focus mainly on the air conditioning units here at the school friday august 01 2008
2747860 it really boggles my mind that were focusing on august 12 that school starts and ends on time i dont know if thats a magic formula to consider at this point

2747914 it appears at this stage that the victim has no links to gang activity and that he was an innocent bystander caught up in the line of fire and was not the intended target
2747915 the victim was walking down walworth road with family members as they entered costcutter two black men forced their way into the shop behind them as if they were trying to get away from something

2747930 en cuanto al tema de las series y hablo por experiencia propia lo que ocurre muchas veces es que tu vas con una idea que aparentemente les gusta a partir de ese momento empieza a opinar una cantidad de gente tal que al final acabas haciendo todo lo contrario a lo que originalmente presentaste ya sea porque en esos momentos utilizan de referente una serie de xito y quieren que todas se parezcan a esa o porque los estudios de audiencia que tienen les indican una u otra cosa en estos casos a excepci n de algunas productoras que todos sabemos quienes son quien marca la pauta de todo lo que se hace y como se hace en televisi n son las propias cadenas

2747932 if you look at the players weve signed john aloisi mark bridge stuart musialik simon colosimo and mitchell prentice plus the quality we have across the board then i suppose thats what theyre going on
2747933 but when you are at a club like sydney its written into a players contract that you must absorb pressure
2747934 theyve had that bling tag since the first year of the competition i dont think it is appropriate but its still there regardless
2747935 its going to be a david and goliath battle all the pressure is on melbourne
2747936 well have some young players that havent been heard of at this level its going to be a real challenge
2747937 hes sitting hsc trials but will also do some training with us to see how things work
2747938 if you look at the players we amp squo ve signed john aloisi mark bridge stuart musialik simon colosimo and mitchell prentice plus the quality we have across the board then i suppose that amp squo s what they amp squo re going on

2747940 no we never made sonny bill williams an offer in 2004
2747941 i remember it well because sonny was at the height of his powers that year
2747942 we had had some initial discussions with williams management but we certainly hadnt put an offer to him and if we had it wouldve been nowhere near the amounts now being bandied about
2747943 to be honest we havent given him a second thought and were getting used to it anyway whenever a big name comes off contract it seems st helens always gets thrown into the mix
2747944 mate theres actually a few of us trying to get our hands on it now
2747945 we reckon it might be worth a bit one day
2747946 no we never made sonny bill williams an offer in 2004
2747947 i remember it well because sonny was at the height of his powers that year
2747948 its been about 12 years and i think weve finished second about 12 times since our last win
2747949 it sure is fantastic it feels like ive got a huge load off my shoulders
2747950 weve committed a lot to do this ive dragged my family halfway across the world to do this were a team thats moving forward and i feel like we needed a win to justify moving forward the way we plan to
2747951 i think the one thing we did well occasionally tonight was move the ball quickly
2747952 you can really catch the geelong defence out one on one and thats what we are going to try and do
2747953 i feel really confident going into the next three weeks
2747954 they geelong are in great form one thing weve really done over the years is rise to big games and special occasions and i think individually guys will be steeling themselves for this week
2747955 if we get up against geelong it would really set our season alight if we can go into the one on one battles and win them individually even if we dont win but we play our style of footy it will really set us up for the last two rounds and hopefully some finals action
2747956 goodesys not going to kick eight goals every week for the rest of the year but you can see what a dynamic player he is and how he can help hally out
2747957 they were both outstanding and the opposition didnt really know what to do in the end freo had one player dropping back but they didnt know whether to send him to hally or send him to goodesy
2747958 it helped our players not being so hally focused and youve got to have multiple options against geelong
2747959 you cant have forwards who arent really smart and know where the ball is because they are very good at dropping off and helping out when players go to dumb spots we certainly need to pick a smart forward line for geelong
2747960 well know by the end of this coming weekend where we stand
2747961 obviously they are the benchmark and they have towelled up a lot of teams this year
2747962 one thing against geelong you have to be bold and brave enough to actually take them on you have to attack you cant think you can just shut them down
2747963 we have an agreement to broadcast afl and an agreement with sbs as our complementary broadcaster for these olympic games
2747964 football is on and televised every weekend but olympics comes every four years
2747965 i was all excited and prepared to sit and watch the diving today but guess what football is obviously more important to channel 7
2747966 channel 7 do not say you have exclusive rights and then deprive us of seeing our favourites once in four years sport by showing regular weekly football
2747967 everybody ring the 1300 number to complain for these idiots to listen to the viewing public otherwise nothing will change
2747968 i really cant believe how poorly channel 7 have covered the olympics or not at all as in the case today please ring and complain
2747969 it seems like it is coming along quite well but it also felt like that the week before the second all blacks game which i missed it will be interesting to see what the doctor has to say
2747970 they have got two games over there so i would be surprised if i wasnt fit for the second game at least
2747971 it feels reasonably good but its hard to say because i havent walked without the boot yet
2747972 you dont always get picked for the next game let alone down the track so you dont want to miss whatever opportunities you get
2747973 you cant walk around with your head around your ankles i dont think one loss is going to worry the boys too much theyll move on pretty quickly
2747974 you can play particular types of games or have a lot of travel and you may tire if your recovery isnt on the mark
2747975 but having played argentina at not full strength i am not sure thats going to have any effect on them south africa in the tri nations
2747976 thats the big thing over there handling the pressure there are big crowds who love the springboks and the side feeds off it the pressure can build up
2747977 you just have to handle that and not lose your focus and i think this side is better equipped
2747978 ini pertanyaan temen laen yang ngerti betapa inginnya saya selesai bulan ini yang tau seberapa besar usaha saya untuk menyelesaikan semuanya tepat waktu

2747984 animals and birds are lucky they dont keep acquiring things the way men do you can teach a monkey to drive a motorcycle but i have never known a monkey to go out and buy a motorcycle
2747985 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
2747986 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now this has turned out not to be the case

2747993 it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are very important to our capital markets
2747994 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2747995 we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2747996 it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are very important to our capital markets
2747997 the banks are more cautious about capital preservation soyoure going to see both the share repurchases and the dividendincreases be very slow if any
2747998 and with that kind of a trend they are going to bepretty conservative about dishing out more in the way ofdividends right now
2747999 the days of high double digit growth are over for a whileand the banks are just concentrating more on keeping theirbalance sheets and everything else clean
2748000 so the banks are going to wait until at least the lastquarter and maybe even next year before you start to see anydividend increases
2748001 i think both banks probably feel it is important tocontinue that dividend pattern so i dont think those those twobanks will miss dividend increase opportunities
2748002 so theyll do it but i suspect the dividend increasesare going to be tiny
2748003 i think the trend in stocks is up i do feel that july 15represented the bottom for stocks and we are going to movehigher

2748056 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2748057 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2748058 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2748060 many people pay more than a third more for organic food in the belief that it has more nutritional content than food grown with pesticides and chemicals
2748061 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2748062 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2748063 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2748073 ich freue mich f r scott dixon und alle jungs unseres teams ich hatte probleme auf geschwindigkeit zu kommen und tony kanaan anm d red hat keine anstalten gemacht es mir leicht zu machen es war guter rennsport ich war wohl einfach nicht schnell genug
2748074 es war ein gutes rennen wir haben beim letzten boxenstopp ein paar pl tze verloren und es ist schwieirg diese zur ck zu gewinnen es schien als w re ich im windschatten ganz gut aber als ich au en lag war ich einfach nicht schnell genug
2748075 es hat spa gemacht und war ein sauberes rennen heute abend ich bin gegen hideki mutoh anm d red und tony kanaan anm d red wheldon und hunter reay gefahren ich sollte mit platz sechs zufriedener sein als ich es tats chlich bin aber als wir herkamen wollten wir eigentlich bis auf das podium oder um den sieg mitk mpfen
2748076 eine menge autos waren am ende schneller als ich vielleicht hatten wir sp ter im rennen zuviel anpressdruck als sich schatten auf die strecke gelegt haben es ist ein gutes resultat und toll ein paar punkte zu kassieren
2748077 das team penske hat heute einen gro artigen job erledigt wir waren best ndig schnell und das auto verhielt sich sehr gut es hat absolut spa gemacht es gab viele enge duelle und das war recht spannend ich denke dass wir ein solides auto hatten wir hatten einfach nur nicht den speed es in die top 3 oder top 4 zu schaffen
2748078 wir haben viel zusammengearbeitet um dieses ergebnis zu erzielen unsere pace war das ganze rennen best ndig aber das timing der gelben flaggen hat uns nicht wirklich geholfen
2748079 wir haben mit einem auto elf pl tze gutgemacht mit dem man keine trainings oder qualifying fahren konnte wir hatten keine ahnung was mit dem wagen passieren w rde wenn das rennen losgeht
2748080 wir waren dieses jahr auf rundkursen schon gut unterwegs aber hier waren wir nicht wirklich so konkurrenzf hig wie wir es h tten sein k nnen ich freue mich auf sonoma und darauf wieder auf einem stra enkurs unterwegs zu sein um ein weiteres top 10 resultat zu erzielen
2748081 ich denke dass die aufh ngung gebrochen ist weil es keinen grund gab abzufliegen ich habe gerade eingelenkt und der wagen schoss geradeaus in die mauer ich bin sicher dass es die aufh ngung war weil das auto erst einknickte und dann direkt in die wand fuhr

2748090 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
2748091 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
2748092 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
2748093 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
2748094 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
2748095 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
2748096 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
2748097 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
2748098 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
2748099 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
2748100 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud

2748121 this is the sort of situation where a simple travel booking system ends up with full expense claim management facilities being built into it with inevitable repercussions for project costs timescales and quality it is really true that no security is needed beyond simple login once logged into the system can users really perform any system operation
2748122 a related mistake that many of us have made is to focus on just a couple of our system stakeholders classically the acquirer who is paying for the system and the end users get all of the attention
2748123 unless the system exhibits a whole range of qualities such as performance security maintainability and so on it is unlikely to be successful
2748124 there are two reasons why the single all inclusive huge visio picture doesnt work well as an architectural description firstly its trying to show too much information in a single representation and secondly no one is really sure quite what each of the different types of symbol that youve drawn mean
2748125 common things to watch out for related to building the system include designs that the developers or testers dont really understand technologies that they arent enthusiastic about or dont have the time to learn and new technologies that dont yet have good tool support or perhaps impose a new and unfamiliar way of working
2748126 start considering performance and scalability early create performance models to try to predict key performance metrics and spot bottlenecks and get stuck into some practical proof of concept work as your design ideas are forming this will all help to increase confidence that there arent any performance and scalability demons lurking in your design
2748127 a mistake made in many systems over the years has been to try to add security into the system using
2748128 the key to getting resources to implement a dr mechanism for your system is to be specific and quantify the cost of system unavailability in a number of realistic scenarios if you can also estimate the probability of the scenarios occurring then you can use these two figures to convince people that dr is important and to justify a certain level of budget to implement it

2748149 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2748150 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2748151 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2748152 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2748153 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2748154 mccain obviously took time to determine first that russia had indeed attacked georgia before demanding restraint from the victim its apparent that mccain has a better grasp of the situation and understood its ramifications as events unfolded obama issued a boilerplate statement that generically demanded that everyone start getting along and had to modify his stance as his 300 foreign policy advisers had a chance to tutor him on the conflict
2748155 id rather vote for the man who gets it right and has spent years studying foreign affairs warfare and american strategic needs than the man who makes it up as he goes along mccain is right this was a 3 am moment and obama proved himself unprepared and unsuited to answer the call

2748194 queda de manifiesto que se ha atentado a uno de los rewe correspondiente al territorio lafkenche lago budi por la carretera de la costa en la comuna de saavedra
2748195 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo

2748208 hadits ini tidak dikenal oleh ahli hadits dan saya belum mendapatkannya baik dengan sanad shahih dhaif lemah maupun maudhu palsu
2748209 mana mungkin perbedaan itu rahmat perbedaan itu pasti laknat wong haditsnya saja dhoif coy
2748210 the differences among the companions of muhammad are a mercy for allahs servants
2748211 i would dislike it if the companions of muhammad did not differ among them because had they not differed there would be no leeway for us
2748212 the people of knowledge are the people of flexibility tawsi a those who give fatwas never cease to differ and so this one permits something while that one forbids it without one finding fault with the other when he knows of his position
2748213 the hadith of layth is a reference to a very famous hadith of the prophet cited by ibn al hajib in the mukhtasar in the section on qiyas analogy which says
2748214 if it had been from other than allah they would have found therein much discrepancy
2748215 and of his mercy he has made night for you so that you would rest in it
2748216 difference of opinion in my community is a mercy for people
2748217 among them is the one that is wrong and the one that is right therefore you must exercise ijtihad
2748218 this is different from what layth said concerning the flexibility allowed for the community since this applies exclusively to the mujtahid as he said
2748219 difference of opinion in my community is a mercy for people
2748220 among the companions is the one that is wrong and the one that is right
2748221 allah has made us gain through the differences among the companions of allahs messenger in their practice
2748222 dont do that i e dont question the difference i dislike stripping the favors of allah from their differences
2748223 i was pleased by the saying of umar ibn abd al aziz i would dislike it if the companions of muhammad did not differ among them because if there were only one view then the people would be in difficulty verily the companions are imams which one uses for guidance innahum aimmatun yuqtada bihim if someone follows the saying of one of them that is sunna
2748224 yet they cease not differing save those on whom thy lord has mercy
2748225 if the companions of the prophet differed regarding a certain question is it permissible for us to check their positions to see who among them is right so that we may follow him
2748226 it is not permissible to check on the prophets companions la yajuz alnazar bayna ashabi rasulillah
2748227 we shall follow in the matter the opinion of our brothers from the hijaz i e school of malik if the quantity of water is more than two pitchers worth the water is still pure if a dead mouse is found in it
2748228 can one pray behind the imam who stands up to lead prayer after being cupped without having renewed his ablution
2748229 how could i not pray behind malik and sa id al musayyib
2748230 can i forbid you from praying behind so and so
2748231 perbedaan diantara sahabat rasulullah muhammad adalah rahmat bagi hamba hamba allah
2748232 hadits layth adalah referensi yang paling terkenal bagi hadits rasulullah dikutip oleh ibn al hajib dalam mukhtasar dalam bab qiyas analogy yang berbunyi
2748233 jika sesuatu dinyatakan sebagai rahmat maka belum tentu kebalikannya adalah kebalikan dari rahmat
2748234 dan diantara rahmat nya dia telah menjadikan malam untukmu sehingga kamu beristirahat di dalamnya
2748235 jelas sekali perkataan tersebut merujuk ke perbedaan dalam pembuatan hukum ahkam
2748236 diantara mereka ada satu yang salah dan satu yang benar
2748237 perbedaan pendapat dalam umat adalah rahmat dan kesepakatan mereka adalah bukti
2748238 ijtima uhum hujjatun qati atun wa ikhtilafuhum rahmatun wasi a kesepakatan para imam fiqh terhadap sebuah pertanyaan adalah bukti yang pasti dan perbedaan pendapat diantara mereka adalah rahmat yang luas jika seseorang tidak mengikuti salah satu satu dari empat imam fiqh maka dia dalam kesalahan karena kebenaran tidak akan ditemukan diluar empat madzhab
2748239 sejumlah besar salaf percaya bahwa perbedaan umat dalam cabang hukum furu sebagai jalan dari rahmat allah
2748240 allah telah membesarkan kita melalui perbedaan antara sahabat rasulullah dalam praktek syariah mereka
2748241 jangan lakukan itu yakni jangan ditanyakan kenapa berbeda aku tidak menyukai penghapusan rahmat allah dari perbedaan mereka
2748242 tetapi mereka senantiasa berselisih pendapat kecuali orang orang yang diberi rahmat oleh tuhanmu

2748298 it is ridiculous and an insult to me to receive such an amount after performing my patriotic duty for so long

2748320 you can begin taking payments as early as age 62 based on social security regulations but when you retire will have an effect on the amount of the payment you receive
2748321 although you are allowed to begin collecting payments at age 62 you will not yet have earned full benefits that means your payments will always be about 25 percent less than they would have been if you had waited until full retirement age

2748367 there is a negotiating season a pay season and a play season
2748368 it is play season and joe is a football player he is out there to compete and win a position on this football team
2748369 after 12 years in this league i know getting acclimated with your quarterback and getting your timing is necessary
2748370 i didnt come to the offseason program i didnt come to otas and i understand theres a thing called order you have to come in as the eighth receiver i understand that ive got to work my way back up if im here
2748371 i am here right now and when wide receivers coach terry robiskie and offensive coordinator mike mularkey feel its time for me to come up in the offense and start getting reps and making plays ill do that
2748372 its never going to be a locker room issue i respect all my coaches i respect coach smith and everybody else im going to come out here and be a professional if they ask me to go im going to go until i hear otherwise been doing working my behind off and catching balls
2748373 there are a lot of young players that i think are going to have a really fun time in jacksonville having their first professional action
2748374 we are excited to get out there and see how we play together when its a live game
2748375 this is the first action that laurent has had in quite some time well have to wait and see how he responds to running around
2748376 i was told that i was going to get in
2748377 i thought matt passed the test in terms of poise and execution
2748378 i thought for the first time in an nfl game he was very impressive
2748379 we wanted to get him in early to play against the best and i thought he handled it extremely well
2748380 its funny jack said hey i love you man for not trying that field goal theres no need in the preseason to plan for overtime
2748381 i thought mike playing for the win was smart for both teams
2748382 i still have a long way to go and im glad that one is under my belt
2748383 we sacked the quarterback a few times which was good to see
2748384 there is still a big hope on laxman and rahul
2748385 they are very capable of getting 100s and we are keeping our fingers crossed that both can get brilliant hundreds tomorrow we will then have some sort of target to defend then let us see what can be done
2748386 it is great the way they came out to bat they felt it was important from the teams point of view that they should bat hats off to them having a serious injury and still they have come out to bat
2748387 it would have been good if the openers had contributed
2748388 it is good to get a good start but this didnt happen and we cannot do anything about that it is why there is a need to have to play well tomorrow and make sure we get maximum runs we can
2748389 it is important to have your four bowlers fit when you are playing a test but unfortunately you cannot do anything about the ishant injury it could have happened to anybody losing him in the middle of the game is a setback i think there were only three bowlers when we were bowling trying to get wickets on this flat wicket hopefully ishant will be fit soon and he will be back soon

2748436 al ser abordado sobre las acciones que la pnc acata en cuanto a la orden de captura girada en contra del gerente de mdf el funcionario policial respondi que 19 mil agentes trabajan en la b squeda de gir n y que la entidad eval a un posible monto de recompensa por informaci n del ahora pr fugo
2748437 sobre el n mero de agentes asignados a la b squeda de gir n mendoza declar
2748438 mendoza indic qur la divisi n de investigaci n criminal dinc tiene instrucciones de ejecutar
2748439 el comisario reconoci que los allanamientos han tenido hasta ahora un resultado negativo pero consider que gir n no ha abandonado el pa s
2748440 el jefe de la pnc indic que se reunir n con otras autoridades de los sectores de seguridad y justicia con el fin de discutir si se otorgar a una recompensa a quien proporcione informaci n sobre el paradero de gir n
2748441 mendoza no dio m s destalles al repecto s lo se limit a decir que se est evaluando esa posibilidad
2748442 todos los allanamientos efectuados por el ministerio p blico y pnc han tenido resultados negativos en el marco de la captura del gerente de mdf donde fueron depositados q82 8 millones de los fondos del congreso de la rep blica se emiti como medida de precauci n una alerta fronteriza con personal de migraci n y polic a
2748443 la orden de captura fue girada por los delitos de caso especial de estafa y estafa en forma continuada por haber defraudado
2748444 es que quieren capturar realmente a los verdaderos culpables de esa operaci n indebida con 82 millones de quetzales del pueblo de guatemala o s lo quieren hacer una cortina de humo al insistir en capturar a ra l gir n gerente y representante de mercados de futuros s a mdf
2748445 no creas que estoy interesado en cobrar la recompensa que anuncian que podr an prometer pero si la ofrecen por la captura de los verdaderos culpables del mal uso de esos q82
2748446 escuchame bien vos palmis en primer lugar los diputados gozan de inmunidad parlamentaria par la men ta ria repito no es una inmunidad para poder cometer cualquier delito sino para tener irresponsabilidad para que puedan decir todo lo que quieran esto quiere decir que tienen inmunidad para expresar en sus discursos en el pleno del congreso todo lo que les d su gana pero no es inmunidad para cometer delitos adem s una casa de bolsa no comete un delito por aceptar una inversi n de q82 8 millones a plazo fijo porque est autorizado por la ley para hacer esos negocios sino lo cometieron en el congreso quienes hicieron esa inversi n con fondos que no les pertenecen ni tampoco son fondos del congreso como se dice err neamente sino son fondos del estado o sea del pueblo de guatemala con esto debe quedar claro que legalmente mdf no ha cometido delito alguno todav a porque el dinero lo recibi a plazo fijo que seg n tengo entendido todav a no ha vencido en todo caso lo cometer si al cumplirse el plazo acordado originalmente cuando se hizo la inversi n no devuelve los q82 8 millones m s los interes que stos hayan devengado
2748447 es verdad que como consecuencia del esc ndalo que se arm cuando trascendi la informaci n los representantes del mdf hicieron la promesa de reintegrarlos el 31 de julio o sea antes de cumplirse el plazo de vencimiento acordado pero el haber faltado a dicha promesa no constituye un delito sino en todo caso solamente una falta a su promesa
2748448 en vez de estar perdiendo el tiempo haciendo tanto esc ndalo con esos in tiles allanamientos con 19 mil agentes de la pnc a las propiedades de los socios de mdf deber an enfocar toda su atenci n en demostrar la culpabilidad de quienes ten an bajo su cuidado ese dinero en el congreso de la rep blica dinero que no ten an por qu mantener en el banco uno sino debi ser depositado en el banco de guatemala o devolverlo al fondo com n

2748460 descidas nos pre os n o s o suficientes falta o governo reduzir o imposto sobre os produtos petrol feros
2748461 lauten muss da der entdecker f lschlicherweise die berreste einer bereits bekannten art f r eine neue gehalten hat und ihr einen neuen namen gab
2748462 creating the connected patient how healthvault and a patient portal is improving the patient experience
2748463 the most surprising thing to us is that we expected we would get patients that have consumer driven health plans but we are seeing very little of that
2748464 our pricing is extremely competitive with major hospitals in jacksonville
2748465 im not sure the public is as interested in hospital charges as everybody is making it out
2748466 its potential to make a difference in the near term in consumers decisions is fairly limited and by the way if its done in a clumsy fashion it could even raise prices
2748467 the answer is unclear because evidence can be marshaled on both sides of the issue
2748468 because higher prices are easier to maintain when the prices charged by each provider involved can be observed by all of the others
2748469 i think as a society were doing all of this but were not sure in the end how useful it is going to be
2748470 one of my other themes is that the government has done some silly things in the price transparency area in putting out a lot of data that is very difficult for people to make any good use out of
2748471 since it absolutely doesnt matter to medicare beneficiaries it is not going to affect their decisionmaking except in a perverse way
2748472 its a pretty complicated process that requires some degree of research
2748473 we felt it was important to talk to patients currently there is too much of a dialogue we need to do
2748474 i dont know if that is completely useful to patients a patient wants to know what they are going to pay out of pocket
2748475 share meaningful information with consumers about the price of their hospital care
2748476 hospitals say it confuses patients thats fine patients can call and ask questions
2748477 smoke screen then probably you have a reason for not showing them
2748478 its putting an unrealistic expectation in the patients mind im afraid every case is individual and all of a sudden they are met with a higher price than they were told im not seeing a push from other patients or doctors for that kind of information
2748479 they dont want hospitals to know what they are paying other providers
2748480 the criticism was deflected to us but it goes way beyond us
2748481 thats the most frustrating thing its all of our issue as opposed to everybody elses issue
2748482 we actually look at the cost of the whole episode from the consumers standpoint
2748483 from a strategic standpoint we view transparency as a great way to engage consumers and help them make informed decisions
2748484 every health plan is offering some level of transparency in terms of showing network prices but i would say relative to others i feel weve taken a slightly different approach in terms of focusing on transparency as a means not an end
2748485 our board members recognize this is just one step in the progression of overall price transparency
2748486 not everybody providers included is on the same page in terms of what should be provided or needs to be provided for consumers to be best informed
2748487 common sense kinds of things i think policymakers are looking for and in part motivating them to do it we welcome it our message consistently has been that we are doing our part and others need to well never be done
2748488 the market is changing and the payer is changing rapidly a growing proportion of the market is covered by insurance where the billing charge might actually be relevant to what a patient pays out of pocket
2748489 we think the trend is in the direction of more consumerism in healthcare and this is our effort to do our part
2748490 what is most important for consumerism is what the patient is going to pay out of pocket
2748491 so much of this is going to depend on how people pay for healthcare if as we believe consumerism is going to be bigger insurers are going to have to play a bigger role in getting information out there a lot is going to depend on what is more relevant to consumers if everybody does his part in engaging consumers then consumers need to take it from there
2748492 so if people want to look at our competitors they wont have to figure out how to get there
2748493 the information we put out there is the same information they have public access to we are just making it easier to find
2748494 we dont know if people know they have the choice to go to a different facility
2748495 well stop once we have the information we asked for in surrounding areas then we have to figure out how to help consumers they deserve the information and we should figure out how to get it to them
2748496 for those interested in what it is going to cost them we want to be responsive and that is why we are putting information on the web
2748497 do people really care about this or do they think quality and pricing are the same everywhere thats a big question mark so i think a lot of people are saying im not going to invest in this unless i absolutely have to somebody has to step out there and try and thats what weve done
2748498 we feel its important for consumers to become engaged in healthcare decisions and they need actionable material at their fingertips
2748499 but were providing it for a wide range of health plans as well as for the uninsured
2748500 one of the most frustrating things for consumers is not knowing what it is going to cost
2748501 medseek is uniquely qualified to offer this type of educational program because we are a niche company that has focused solely on delivering and supporting enterprise wide hospital portals our professional services group comprised of consultants emarketing specialists and ehealth specialists has worked with hospital executives in over 600 hospitals across north america to develop successful strategies and tactical plans for building their organizations relationships with consumers patients employees physicians and the referring physician community in their geographical regions

2748520 we wont do that again during the meet but for the first race i wanted to make sure he was ready
2748521 on the take off she initiated twisting a little early
2748522 it wasnt a fall or anything but it gave us a tiny disturbance at the last minute we had to reorganize things and readdress
2748523 its something we werent expecting it threw us for a loop its more stressful knowing we only had four gymnasts and that it is four up and four scores count but we put it into our minds that we couldnt let anything get to us
2748524 i missed out on the floor exercise finals which is sad
2748525 but you get hyped up and throw a little too much power into it and before you know it youre out of bounds
2748526 there wasnt anything wrong i fell it was a mistake
2748527 well we didnt feel as hopeless as it might look
2748528 we were dealing with some injuries and we werent playing well but we knew when healthy we had the personnel and it helped that nobody in our division was running away
2748529 it helps a lot that shows that the guys in here are capable of putting together a streak like that
2748530 i looked at our schedule before the break and saw it was favorable
2748531 i noticed we already had played all the teams at the top of the other divisions twice so we were done with them when youre playing a lot of teams under 500 obviously thats going to help you
2748532 because of their offense they have the kind of team to put together a good winning streak we saw that last year
2748533 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
2748534 if he needs to blow his own trumpet well fine
2748535 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2748536 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife
2748537 it gives the impression that people here depend on people from abroad to come and show us things in our own backyard
2748538 probably people have overreacted its nationalism going a bit awry

2748540 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2748541 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

2748543 helllllo browns fans hollie strano here from wkycs morning show giving you the latest for tonights game
2748544 home plate looked to be about 120 feet away when i came in the game
2748545 i was as nervous as i was when i made my big league debut but after i threw the first strike it seemed just like another game
2748546 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2748547 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2748548 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2748549 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2748550 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2748551 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2748552 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2748553 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2748554 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2748555 if its the yatra that matters then lets set our egos aside and concentrate on the yatra lets reconstitute the sasb with only state subjects lets get the governor to pass an ordinance to make the sasb chairman also a state subject
2748556 let the sasb conduct next years yatra with as much land and facilities as it requires facilities created at the expense not of the sasb but of the state government and see if this satisfies the yatris who come from all over the country
2748557 even after this if the need is felt to reduce the yatra to 800 kanals nearly 40 hectares of land im sure that a case can be made to trade 800 kanals for the 3 200 or more kanals of land that wont be used in the future
2748558 whats a year in time compared to a dismembered jammu and kashmir because if this tension continues i fear that is where we are headed a division of our state on communal lines

2748619 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2748620 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2748621 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2748622 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2748623 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2748624 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2748625 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2748626 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2748632 t he news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
2748633 the government of georgia has called for a ceasefire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course that it has chosen
2748634 sen mccain is clearly willing to note who he thinks is the aggressor here

2748637 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2748638 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public when a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story i used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it but being 99 honest is no longer enough
2748639 i went from being a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president becoming a national public figure all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2748640 i see no end i dont think anythings ended my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on

2748649 proof that our approach to drugs is working is in terms of overall illicit drug use in australia the numbers have been dropping for the last 10 years
2748650 the proportion of the population who had used any illicit drug in the last 12 months fluctuated between 1991 and 2004 reaching a similar level in 2004 15 to the prevalence in 1993 14
2748651 the proportion of the australian 20 29 year old population who has used or using amphetamines has increased from 20 9 in 1998 adhikari and summerill 2000 to 22 or 624 600 people in 2002
2748652 between 1979 and 1999 the standardised death rate from drugs other than alcohol and tobacco increased by 79 from five to nine deaths per 100 000 persons driven primarily by increases in deaths of males from opiates
2748653 there are few instances in which drug law enforcement can claim more than transitory success
2748654 the pattern of increased law enforcement activity followed by a sustained reduction in heroin availability is so extraordinary that policy makers would be wise to question whether this pattern is explained by other factors

2748693 it was a treacherous race out there i just raced hard every lap i tried to force positions when i could
2748694 there were a lot of slow cars that seemed to be in the way youve got to be careful out there and at the same time you cant be soft because people take advantage of you

2748787 god unites us all when we are one in god miracles can happen that is why im requesting prayers two weeks ago my 44 years old neighbor got sick with pain while conducting a meeting at the hospital where he works he was diagnosed with kidney cancer before they could do anything it advanced to the bladder and lungs he has 4 children a girl 18 a boy 12 and two beautiful twin girls 6 i feel humble at the immensity of his faith and strength he says he needs to fight because his children need him god can unite us all in prayer to support this man that still has so much to do thank you
2748788 we rock harder and with more frequency than any other band in the world
2748789 the opening ceremonies was an absolutely phenomenal experience a once in a lifetime honor to see the other athletes to see the spectacle it was fantastic
2748790 the guy walking along the roof of the stadium was unbelievable i think his name was li that was incredible i enjoyed the lighting of the torch
2748791 i dont think its really hit them yet were so used to the traveling and the tournament in haining but now that were here seeing everything the security credentials all of that its going to really start to hit them i think theyre excited its neat because its their first time their guests are coming in and its going to be a fun time
2748792 no actually its a lot of fun for us with russia theres a rivalry because theres so many years of competition with australia you can go back to sydney where we beat them in their home country they won the fiba world championship this last time for us its a great rivalry we play against them in the wnba we play with them we play overseas to me its a friendly competition in a sense that we all know each other and play together we respect each other and were going out there to play a great basketball game
2748793 assuredly this man too was with him for he also is a galilean

2748803 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute the readings
2748804 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
2748805 we used patient data to examine the association between body mass index or bmi a measure of obesity and the amount of disease discovered after surgery to remove the prostate
2748806 we compared men who had their cancers detected by psa screening to those who had an abnormal digital rectal exam which may not confer the same bias against obese men
2748807 in contrast obese men with abnormal digital rectal exams had similar outcomes as normal weight men
2748808 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
2748809 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
2748810 obesity is very common in the united states so this potentially affects a lot of people
2748811 we cant forget that when we use the term obese we are not just talking about very very large men a man who is 5 foot 9 and weighs 203 pounds would be considered obese

2748815 the radio free europe radio liberty georgian service reported that in pot military boats of the georgian armed forces were bombed which led to death of at least two dozens of people it also reported that infrastructure damage was also serious as a result of the air strikes
2748816 koba liklikadze a correspondent from radio free europe radio libertys georgian service said close to the artillery base we saw a dreadful sight
2748817 the u s taxpayer funded radio free europe radio liberty website published a ridiculous article by echo moskvy radios yulia latynina calling south ossetia a terrorist state and comparing the region to the plo or hezbollah statelets in southern lebanon as if the south ossetians were sending suicide bombers and rockets into georgia
2748818 can parties to the conflict attack radio and television stations military attacks on broadcast facilities used for military communications are legitimate under international humanitarian law but such attacks on civilian television or radio stations are prohibited if they are designed primarily to undermine civilian morale or to psychologically harass the civilian population
2748819 in tbilisi a large radio and tv tower was blacked out early saturday morning for fear of attack
2748820 after the may 21 parliamentary elections in which mr saakashvili claimed a constitutional majority television and radio stations were under threat in fact there is only one television station rustavi 2 left with permission to air any news at all the station as it happens is owned and operated by the georgian government how convenient
2748821 today in his first interview on international television since the conflict in south ossetia georgian president mikheil saakashvili told bloomberg what we have here is a full scale russian invasion of georgian territory
2748822 this morning georgian president mikheil saakashvili took to the media to make his case saakashvili appeared on cnn american morning just after 8 35amet and was interviewed by kiran chetry in his first u s interview he had previously been interviewed by bbc news and bloomberg in the u k

2748840 your government has been very attentive very sympathetic and i appreciate that a lot
2748841 we dont have a quarterback and we just need offense we dont have offense
2748842 the key thing about this year is pressure there is none and there is no reason why the bears shouldnt win 8 10 games

2748857 se d roulera du 13 au 17 novembre 2008 parisexpo porte de versailles
2748858 i am very happy with the team and their resilience i must say we battled very hard we had good chances to score the second goal many times unfortunately we conceded a bad goal ourselves overall i felt we dealt with set pieces and the main threat from blackburn was long balls we dealt well with it the players are of course frustrated because we should have come home with three points but lets just keep that attitude in the future
2748859 of course jens is really unhappy with it he is really down in the dressing room i dont need to tell him he made a mistake he is an intelligent boy and he knows that we do not want to blame him today we just want to take the positives from our behaviour
2748860 i was offered adriano on loan and i said no
2748861 we do not need him and it was an easy decision to make because were not out there to sign another striker
2748862 the agreement was for a loan adriano has qualities we dont need they wanted to give us a player but wanted one back in return
2748863 i wont say who it was i didnt want to lose the player they requested i didnt necessarily think adriano would upset the balance of the squad
2748864 i have bought eduardo da silva i already had emmanuel adebayor and robin van persie and i brought nicklas bendtner back
2748865 i still have theo walcott and abou diaby can play through the middle why should i bring more forwards in
2748866 i have big faith in my squad and theyve proved me right so far this season
2748867 yes i messed up but i will learn from my mistake and grow from here
2748868 if i struck someone else am i not only also striking myself and how would that benefit me
2748869 he caught the eye and gets you off your seat
2748870 he can be pleased with his input if youre asking me whether hes better off being in the seniors and coming off the bench for 15 minutes at wembley tonight or getting 90 minutes here id say its more useful for him to be getting a full game with u s
2748871 lassana is a multi functional player making him a great addition to our squad not only is he hard working he has a creative edge and is comfortable playing in the middle of the pitch or at right back
2748872 i have great respect for the manager arsene wenger and am attracted by the style of football that the team plays
2748873 of course i am excited by what the future holds and keen to play my part in helping arsenal fight for trophies

2748876 thierry henry was an outstanding player for them for many many years and you always feared an arsenal side with him in the line up
2748877 but they have got other young players that can come to the fore and start to flourish and be the main guys for arsenal for many years
2748878 if you look at the likes of van persie who has been a thorn in our side in recent years he is an outstanding talent and maybe its time for him to step up to the mark and be the main man

2748886 its a big gamble when clubs spend big money for each new season but we do not spend
2748887 arsene has his policy of signing players and he does what he believes is right for the club
2748888 my heart is tied to this football club so signing a new deal was always my intention arsenal is the club of my life
2748889 i am without a doubt mentally the strongest player at arsenal because i have more experience
2748890 there will always be a keeper who will play better for two or three matches but i have never seen anyone do this for ten games
2748891 i know that i have an advantage at arsenal and that i can keep it i dont see any young supermen keeping me out
2748892 i know i will be playing again at arsenal the coach will let me play
2748893 he knows it and i know it it doesnt matter if i have another week out
2748894 the president ramon calderon and sport director predrag mijatovic have spoken to me who gave him the ok for that but finally i decided to follow on with my commitment to arsenal it is not true that i have given them my word to join for next season the meeting was pleasant and i believe that they are good and very sincere people i am very happy at arsenal and i go 100 per cent with the decision i took although i praise the interest of real in me
2748895 they helped me mature because of the huge responsibility that i have
2748896 it also strengthened my belief in what is important in the game
2748897 i could check my beliefs because the club gave me that kind of freedom that is very important in the life of a manager
2748898 is it anger is it aggression or is it a desire to be successful would i compromise my principles on occasions yes as first and foremost i am a winner but long term thats not my attitude
2748899 you can sometimes be surprised by your bad side i have a dark side you want to win so much that sometimes you forget that it is as well that you respect the rules when you dont win you have to acknowledge the respect of your opponents as well sometimes i cant do that it is a dark side because the perfect side would be to say well done you played better you never know in 50 years i might achieve it
2748900 at the moment i have not really wondered who will start
2748901 i knew yesterday that jens could not play so we go for continuity at the moment
2748902 alumina will play on saturday lehmann is injured he had to pull out of the second match because of his shoulder he has bone bruising from that game at blackburn
2748903 well see what happens when he comes back but this is not the only difficult decision i have to make right now we have lassana diarra coming in mathieu flamini doing well at right back but we have sagna coming back also do i play gilberto who is only coming back on friday so it is all very open

2748910 i am very excited that allegiant air will provide central oregon nonstop service to phoenix from redmond airport
2748911 this is one of our most requested destinations and i expect it will do very well in our market allegiant air provides quality nonstop service at reasonable prices to las vegas now and phoenix will be a welcome addition to that service at a time when other airlines are pulling back service allegiant continues to expand into markets like redmond that is a positive sign for our future

2748931 non ha senso una pretesa riforma della grafia aggiunge b rberi squarotti e del resto i dizionari raccolgono tutte le lettere dellalfabeto per parole tecniche ad esempio che richiedono una grafia di uso esclusivamente specialistico
2748932 una lingua muore quando ne sparisce la tradizione risponde ancora b rberi squarotti e internet non una rottura con la tradizione ma una tecnica nuova usata da una minoranza di persone mentre la lingua duso non pu essere tecnica e astratta
2748933 le riforme ortografiche sono sempre un disastro come si dimostrato con quella proposta in francia tre anni fa respinta anche dai francesi del canada e della svizzera come presumo farebbero se passasse in italia i nostri connazionali allestero

2748962 before the election kevin rudd promised to lower petrol and grocery prices but now admits there is nothing he can do apart from the grocery watch and fuelwatch stunts
2748963 we now have wayne swan taking the reverse approach of first admitting he had no powers to force banks to lower interest rates and then threatening to use his powers against the banks
2748964 rather than continue to make empty promises to australians and hollow threats to business labor should admit it deliberately misled the public before the election by making promises to reduce financial pressures on working families promises that labor cannot fulfil
2748965 we dont have a formal mechanism to force the banks to do that
2748966 there are no other measures that were looking at this stage
2748967 other options open to me to enhance competition with the banks

2749026 for whatever reason even if the cessation is based on socially reprehensible considerations
2749027 however at the end of the day im no more determined than i am at any other race
2749028 i have to do the same job eleven times in a year and i am a great believer that you have to go to every race with the same attitude although it is nice to be at home and be in front of the british fans i have the same attitude as ever and that is to win the race i hope we can be there and be fast and put on a good show hopefully we can score as many points as possible
2749029 im not a natural sprinter so i find it really hard to go out at that pace but i just tried to get closer and closer
2749030 i was pretty nervous because it was my first swim and i didnt know what to expect so to do that time in my first olympics then im really happy
2749031 im just happy that ive made the final and i have a second chance ill eat lots and sleep lots and do a swim down ive got tonight to rest so ill be fine for the morning
2749032 a pb would great tomorrow obviously its a morning swim but im really looking forward to it
2749033 i was very nervous going into the race so anything was going to be good
2749034 i just wanted to make the semi final that was the best i could hope for going into the semi final i know theres a good chance of making the final because ive swum faster than i did today so if i can conquer the nerves then i can go faster
2749035 tonight i just raced because all i wanted to do was make it to tomorrow to conserve energy and make it to the final
2749036 i need to bank as much rest as possible and as much sleep as i can so as not to get run down this morning was pretty emotional
2749037 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2749038 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2749039 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2749040 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2749041 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2749042 we have spoken on the phone and i was in tears afterwards

2749047 acquire all the outstanding stock of a vision care company
2749048 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2749049 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2749050 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2749051 im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2749052 we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2749053 it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are very important to our capital markets

2749062 we want them to feel that theyre being judged on their smarts and their competitiveness and their compassion and not just you know looking cute
2749063 well she seems like a good person her family seems to love her everybody makes mistakes so i hope that people wont judge her for just this one picture
2749064 we want to make sure that theyre not landing on some site that would make us blanch
2749065 when i let her know that i understood and heard what she was saying i think that was important to her
2749066 as a consequence of my books doing well suddenly its easier to get takeout whenever we feel like it its easier to get a housekeeper to come in one or two days to help do the laundry or help clean up its easier to do a lot of things that frankly the vast majority of american women cant afford but were not that far removed from the situation where this work was falling on her in a very heavy way
2749067 but what i know is that shell be at the center of the democratic party for a very long time
2749068 i am willing to shell out any amount for kim ive been trying to get her to do it for years

2749072 and whoever the next candidate is whether its john mccain or barack obama the next president is i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury
2749073 but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2749074 im going to do everything i can to step up to any problems that are going to face the country but again i look forward to doing other things you know next year
2749075 i believe it is going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all of the housing problems
2749076 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2749077 i think it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are important to our capital markets broadly
2749078 my inference is that they concluded that this administration would not release hamdan at the end of his sentence but the next one might
2749079 i think hamdans continued detention past the end of his sentence although justifiable under the law of war would be a political train wreck and i think the panel made an effort to protect the u s from further international criticism
2749080 and whoever the next candidate is whether its john mccain or barack obama the next president is i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury
2749081 but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
2749082 im going to do everything i can to step up to any problems that are going to face the country but again i look forward to doing other things you know next year
2749083 i believe it is going to take us well beyond the end of the year to work through all of the housing problems
2749084 well we have no plans to insert money in either of those institutions
2749085 i think it was very important that we get these temporary backup facilities because fannie and freddie are important to our capital markets broadly
2749086 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
2749087 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got these cold chills
2749088 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2749089 i was very nervous today as its been very difficult for my people
2749090 it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace
2749091 sometimes i felt like i was drowning more or less coming down the climb the first time i was just freezing and i couldnt stop shaking
2749092 an explicitly enumerated union of explicitly enumerated sets is explicitly enumerated
2749093 kom maar terug lelijke sijkbak als je een goeie behahaha hebt aangetrokken
2749094 ja maar ik wil eigenlijk nu die nog eens passen
2749095 en dan kopen we die wel de volgende keer als de uitkering daar weer is en de giro wederom vol gelopen want voor niets gaat de zon op en treedt een bijstandsuitkering in werking
2749096 de pasvorm van de bustehouders is beter dan ooit in de historie van de mens heid de materialen zijn softer en geven veel meer steun dan de bustehouders uit de jaren vijftig die petat friet puntzakken van toen raak je vandaag de dag niet meer aan de straatstenen kwijt zelfs niet als kotszak dus daar ligt het niet aan
2749097 ieder man zou op zijn tijd een bustehouder moeten dragen
2749098 het komt de androgiene gelijkschakeling ten goede en werkt ook door op het emancipatories vlak
2749099 kom maar terug als je wel echt zin in een mooie buste houder hebt lelijke sijkbak je bent me een oud wijf met biertieten waar de honden geen brood van lusten en denk er om als je de volgende keer niet gelijk voor zeshonderd eurootjes lingerie aan schaft bel ik wel even naar je wijf om door te lullen waar jij mee bezig bent onder kantoortijd
2749100 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2749101 i think for full restoration of the constitution and for the survival of this nation and for democracy in this country it is very necessary that gen musharraf resigns himself otherwise the impeachment will start
2749102 the numbers are there that is written on the wall it is better that he should say goodbye and leave
2749103 i remember a friend that believed and cared for me and i couldnt let him down
2749104 neither judy nor i have any desire to run budget hotels or do this project halfway
2749105 the revenues that can be generated at these properties can only support so much investment
2749106 so really the state investment is bridging the gap between say the historic hotel niagara continuing to operate as a travelodge based on what revenues can support versus a four star property that we can really hold out as a beacon of revitalization
2749107 we have a situation now in downtown niagara falls where we have a shortage of hotel rooms
2749108 if you want to compete with canada if you want to be a truly renowned destination you have to start with some basic infrastructure
2749109 one thing that should be pretty obvious is that if somebody cant get a room to stay we lose all other money
2749110 the hotel niagara was such a deteriorated building that it was going to cost a lot of money to bring it to the standards that the new owners want and what the marketplace is demanding
2749111 every tourist destination needs a mix of rooms for every type of traveler but for a long long time we didnt have what i would consider first class hotel rooms and thats where the deficit is and was
2749112 the fact that it takes taxpayer subsidies to assist in their renovation is just mind boggling
2749113 it just further reinforces some of the horrible spending practices that we have i just dont think that the return on investment is going to be there all its going to do is line up the next hotel near the casino who wants to renovate on the taxpayers dime
2749114 there will be a point where the market will reach a critical mass
2749115 there is a greater risk at the beginning than in the middle or the end i dont think that the message were sending is that this is an open ended opportunity
2749116 even though occupancy levels have increased year over year were still talking about low occupancy figures a good shot view of hotel 101 is that you have to run at least 50 percent occupancy to be profitable
2749117 if all the niagara falls hotels are running 54 to 55 percent then youve got quite a few of them that probably arent doing well
2749118 as a female i personally thought investing was sole for men inside four short weeks of doing jamies program we bought the first investment for the discount of septet 5 under the valuation which meant the benefit of 19 000 in stock straight up with a confidence of that experience i personally listed a few of the add value cash flow strategies and negotiated the wage pack from a measly 28 000 by the year to 48 000 you can launder the sums around simply little joe weeks we literally manufactured 39 000 away from this stoked

2749149 he said hey this first match in the olympic games is what were gearing up for
2749150 obviously we wish he could be here even though we understand why hes not
2749151 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think we should be doing and having him say i dont think so rather than where i am right now

2749153 im just glad i could race the best medley racers in the world tonight i mean this morning
2749154 its just bizarre i think i might be older than her parents
2749155 i think there are a lot of middle aged women and men who i know and who have contacted me or e mailed me or stopped me in the street and told me i was an inspiration to them
2749156 as ive said from the beginning of this age is just a number
2749157 i knew i was in very good shape for this race
2749158 i know it looks bad but i dont think its that bad
2749159 i might be coughing later but right now im not
2749160 i had trouble breathing all the way up the climb
2749161 the fog you see is based on the basis of humidity and heat it does not mean to say that this fog is the same as pollution it can be pollution but the fog doesnt mean necessarily that it is pollution
2749162 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement

2749180 just like 30 years ago no one knew that mcdonalds would be so prevalent in china
2749181 when they start chasing the bus eight blocks that was crazy
2749182 ive never experienced anything like that i expect it now to be crazier this time around with this being the olympics and everything
2749183 during the cultural revolution they got rid of western classical music and anything else western was frowned upon with only a handful of exceptions one was basketball
2749184 before women in senegal could have children and keep playing in mali you stopped now women keep playing its changing a lot

2749211 apoi ca la comanda unele state s au situat pe pozitia de a critica rusia iar in prezent impiedica decizia legata de incetarea luptelor punand sub semnul intrebarii metodele obiectivele si ritmul acesteia ceea ce ridica semne de intrebare fata de cat de sincera si cat de corecta este atitudinea lor fata de rusia
2749212 in viitor cand va participa la discutiile privind structurile internationale moscova va tine cont de aceste aspecte
2749213 we are still putting all the pieces of this investigation together
2749214 it is too early for us to look at just one thing
2749215 it got pretty hectic with people wanting to know where their loved ones were
2749216 it was very poignant your heart goes out to people
2749217 their families have come up from other areas to identify their parents or loved ones it is heartbreaking
2749218 but were not about blaming people were about our faith
2749219 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
2749220 up to this hour i can tell you from our sources shes believing that eventually she and john edwards will be together and this will all work out
2749221 took place for a short period in 2006 and that
2749222 she was mad she was angry i think furious would be a good way to describe it
2749223 i in 2006 told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness
2749224 they lived in a single house most of the time and split to two houses recently
2749225 more thought revealed that i needed a poetic undertone something which better illustrated my own attitude to life i consulted the oracles

2749229 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2749230 i for the life of me cant imagine how that could be a proportional response to allegations that georgians had fired upon russian peacekeepers
2749231 the reason were going to the region in such a rush is that were trying to figure out whats going on down there
2749232 if you compare the russian side with the georgian side it appears right away that something is really very wrong with the information we are receiving
2749233 those who have been supplying arms to georgia i believe they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life of civilians including many russian citizens and peacekeepers
2749234 i think those who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis aggressive intentions and who helped create a feeling of impunity among the georgian leadership should think twice
2749235 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position
2749236 only china can decide what course it will follow but im optimistic about the prospects
2749237 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2749238 its not what someone knows that can be dangerous but its what they know for sure that just aint so
2749239 the american people have the constitutional right to be wrong
2749240 the fact that we are ready not to place a nato army outside of german territory gives the soviet union a firm security guarantee
2749241 in that context how america manages eurasia is critical a power that dominates eurasia would control two of the worlds three most advanced and economically productive regions a mere glance at the map also suggests that control over eurasia would almost automatically entail africas subordination rendering the western hemisphere and oceania geopolitically peripheral to the worlds central continent about 75 per cent of the worlds people live in eurasia and most of the worlds physical wealth is there as well both in its enterprises and underneath its soil eurasia accounts for about three fourths of the worlds known energy resources

2749243 when i read that i thought this boy has the dna to be president
2749244 that makes him much more acceptable to the rest of the world of any president weve had so far
2749245 i think what disturbs people is that he obama never was a black leader but i see that as a strength
2749246 im going to do everything i can to help him
2749247 just like john f kennedy had to distance himself from the catholic church obama has to be president of america and be a leader of the world
2749248 if that was the excitement in germany can you imagine what it would be in latin america africa and asia
2749249 the reaction to obama demonstrates the kind of hope the rest of the world has in america
2749250 in order to maintain our leadership in a global economy we have to work with the rest of the world with the transfer of technology we either lead the world or we get trampled by it

2749254 that has got to be the most absurd thing ive ever heard
2749255 and believe me ive heard some pretty absurd things before
2749256 we have neither tasted cake nor been attacked by the wraith in fifty generations
2749257 oh please theres some sort of ancient technology and youve just gotten some mumbo jumbo hand waving mixed in
2749258 and by that he means wed be honored to start off your sacrifice
2749259 i doctor rodney mckay would like you to know that i choose to eat my cake like a rational person
2749260 well maybe it is just a silly old belief after all cake for everyone then
2749261 im just saying youre not as young as you used to be sir
2749262 just because ronon and corporal venner can still play tarzan doesnt mean its a good idea for you do the same
2749263 you dont have a lot of room to talk you know
2749264 unlike you i can recognize my limitations which is why i gracefully declined
2749265 a co has to show hes willing to do anything hed ask his men to do
2749266 youre the last person who needs to do anything of the sort and i doubt dislocating your shoulder would have been a good demonstration
2749267 i know you spar a lot but you really should consider coming to doctor simpsons yoga classes it wouldnt be hard to fit them into your schedule
2749268 i havent heard you complaining about how flexible i am
2749269 what are you fuck ow ow ow oh hey thats better
2749270 one moment they were there i turned around for a minute and then
2749271 hey that means we do know where two thirds of them are
2749272 thats half the battle well figure out how to fix things in no time
2749273 no one blames you for what happened captain this sort of thing happens theres a reason teyla and i both warned you before letting you go off world with them
2749274 i can guarantee colonel sheppard wont hold this against you right sir
2749275 it has been trying but rewarding none the less i would not give it up
2749276 still it will be nice to have a day to regain my strength
2749277 i must admit that i have been looking forward to this day ever since you offered to watch him for me
2749278 the others have said they would take him as well but while i would trust them with his life
2749279 it would all end in tears before within a couple of hours
2749280 mckay would panic at the first cry and while john and ronon can face down wraith they wouldnt have the slightest idea what to do about a dirty diaper
2749281 precisely for grown men they have some very odd shortcomings regarding the basic necessities of life
2749282 dont take this the wrong way but im glad johns going to have to learn now instead of when we go through it ourselves
2749283 i should be going i am meeting doctor keller for lunch
2749284 because i can see that youre missing your dorsal heavy turret
2749285 oh that yeah had to jettison it after the magazine took a hit
2749286 and it looks like all six of the phased laser arrays on your starboard broadside are melted
2749287 what can i say apparently they dont like being pushed past two hundred percent rated output
2749288 i can see straight through to the other side of the ship you want any help
2749289 i suppose that a little assistance wouldnt hurt if you insist
2749290 my main fabber happened to be where that hole is so i guess that would make self repair a little tricky
2749291 i should have enough trinium and titanium to at least patch the breach and replace the main structural members enough to get you home and to a proper drydock
2749292 all right beginning approach maneuver ill dock on the port side it looks a little less broken
2749293 dock you know evan theres a time and a place for everything lorne but this isnt it
2749294 normally im not one to complain about a little post battle celebration
2749295 but we really should get repairs done before we try anything that creative
2749296 okay okay try not to panic were going to be fine
2749297 i mean the sensors say this part of the building is still stable so all we need to do is wait for the engineers to clear the corridor and well be fine
2749298 thats exactly what i told you a couple of minutes ago it was just that one lab theyll have us out in no time maybe an hour at worst
2749299 oh god i wonder if were still getting fresh air
2749300 theres a breeze from the vent mckay which you would notice if you would pay attention for a minute instead of imagining new ways to die
2749301 excuse me for having a bit of anxiety after a building exploded and trapped me in a small space
2749302 hey it is not my fault at all how was i supposed to know it that equipment would blow up
2749303 wait a second what if this is going to blow up too
2749304 it hasnt exploded yet so i bet its not going to anytime soon
2749305 okay youre right this one isnt going to blow up theres nothing in it to blow up but who knows what else around here could blow up
2749306 could you at least shut up so i could take a nap
2749307 what no lets see there has to be a power source somewhere and if its naquadah based we could all be vaporized in an instant if something went wrong so
2749308 ive been looking forward to this for a while ive heard a lot about you
2749309 most of it jack speaks highly of you as did dr weir
2749310 good good and before i forget my condolences on the death of your father
2749311 we met a few times during my primary campaign back in 04 he seemed like a good man
2749312 so im sure you must be wondering why i asked you here on such short notice
2749313 i want to assure you that at the moment your job is in no danger
2749314 quite frankly i wasnt pleased at all with colonel carters removal or the way it was handled but the ioa had concerns regarding a serving air force officer as head an international civilian expedition and it wasnt politically viable to force the issue on the other hand i did remind them that so long as the u s is providing four fifths of the forces stationed in the city not to mention the only means of getting there the choice in military commander will remain firmly with our hands
2749315 once they heard that they were quick to assure me that there were no plans to suggest you be reassigned at all between you and me i think that theyd rather have someone who doesnt always listen to them but whos loyal to the expedition than someone whos obedient only because his superiors in the pentagon tell him to play along
2749316 dont worry i mean it as a complement i spent enough time in the service to know sometimes the situation in the field calls for more flexibility than the people in washington recognize now thats not to say id have made all the same decisions you have or that some of them havent been bad calls but i do like the way youre willing to stick your neck out when the situation calls for something out of the ordinary
2749317 in fact thats one of the reasons why youre here tell me whats your opinion of the ioa
2749318 well sir im sure they mean well but sometimes their policies seem a bit disconnected from our goals in pegasus
2749319 nicely put colonel i think what you wanted to say is that they tend to be dysfunctional at best and now that theres no major threats to earths security in the milky way theyre becoming increasingly so and some of their decisions of late such as the replicators on the odyssey and their treatment of our off world allies have been nearly disastrous if it werent for the need to work together in controlling how disclosure eventually happens id seriously consider ditching them entirely ive even discussed matters with my counterparts in a few of our closer allies and with key members of congress
2749320 i do want to say that the international members of the expedition have been invaluable sir and i uh strongly urge that whatever happens that be taken into consideration
2749321 of course thats actually the furthest thing from what im thinking tell me colonel have you ever seen one our mark nines in action
2749322 not a mark nine no but i saw some of the smaller warheads in use when we deployed horizon at asuras
2749323 youd wipe half the eastern seaboard sir everything within a hundred miles would be vaporized outright the fireball would be about five six hundred miles wide and youd get blast effects a lot further luckily half the affected area would be out to sea and depending on detonation altitude the appalachians might keep it from spreading too far inland
2749324 of course the sad thing is that its not just the aliens we have to worry about
2749325 i doubt youve ever run across this is pegasus but theres been a number of times weve gone through the gate and found a society that had never met people from off world most of those times the societies in question have self destructed beyond that the asgard tollan and tokra might have been smug bastards at times but they had good reasons based on experience to think that handing out advanced technology was a good way to see less advanced civilizations blow themselves up
2749326 id like to think earth would do better and so far we have but i cant forget that we nearly had president
2749327 and that even america could find itself with some nut job whod end up killing us all to say nothing of other countries
2749328 sir thats all interesting in a frightening and morbid way but i cant help but wonder what it has to do with me
2749329 no matter what might happen be it external attack or internal fuckup we need to make sure our civilization survives somehow preferably in a way that will leave someone to come home and get us back on our feet the alpha site is a start especially if we can start to implement some of the colonization plans were working on but it would still be vulnerable to attack from inside the milky way atlantis on the other hand is much more secure has the ancient database and even has some infrastructure already in place yes theres the wraith but back here weve got the jaffa a few remaining goauld and who knows what else
2749330 that certainly seems reasonable sir are you talking about setting up atlantis as a colony as well
2749331 ideally we would be but i think were going to be lucky to keep the expedition running let alone expanding it on that scale in fact in many ways its even more vulnerable to politically caused disaster than things here at home we need to approach the situation from an oblique angle which is where you come in colonel
2749332 general oneill tells me that when it comes down choosing to do to whats right and necessary and whats legal youll come down on the side of whats right he also when pressed grudgingly admitted you might feel that atlantis is your real home now is that right
2749333 good now before we go on i should tell you that what im going ask you next could be interpreted as being highly illegal and possibly a violation of your oath as an officer should you act on what i say and get in trouble for doing so ill deny this conversation ever happened as such ill give you a chance to leave now no hard feelings
2749334 all right sir i cant guarantee ill do whatever it is but ill hear you out
2749335 excellent colonel in that case i have a job for you
2749336 so uh i know you probably all are wondering why i asked you guys here
2749337 ive been thinking about a few things lately what with carter being recalled and woolsey taking her place i dont know how much you all know about what happened to me a few weeks ago but the gate shot me into the future because actually i cant even remember why the important thing is what i got told there which was that in the not too distant future maybe a year maybe longer the ioa may be thinking about essentially abandoning atlantis
2749338 i hope so but now woolseys here just like in that timeline i could see the ioa deciding to pull most of us out and leave just a skeleton crew and the sgc wouldnt fight them you all remember how they treated us like crap last time
2749339 they said they sgc didnt have room for everyone coming back and that it would do us all good to spend some time away from each other to adjust they deliberately separated us from our friends our families and gave those they deigned to allow to remain in the program positions that were way below what they deserved
2749340 now i dont know about the rest of you but i for one dont feel like dealing with that again so um what im about to propose well its pretty damned illegal you can probably see where this is going and if it bothers you id ask you to leave no one will think any less of you
2749341 i believe i speak for all when i say i am greatly honored that you choose to include us in your confidence colonel sheppard even if we end up disagreeing i am sure none will betray your words
2749342 atlantis is our home pegasus is our home we must act to protect that home now and safeguard the other humans in pegasus from the wraith and whatever else is out there were the only ones with the technology to challenge them and prevent another ten thousand years of wraith domination and so its up us to make a stand against them we have a chance to make a difference here maybe turn atlantis into something more than just an outpost of earth id like to say that we could manage that without any trouble but i think we all know that sooner or later we may be in a situation where whats expedient for earth or the ioa and whats good for pegasus may conflict we need to be prepared for either outcome
2749343 it wont be easy most of you remember what the first year was like but were far better off now than we were then if we get caught before things are ready it wont go well for us but i think its worth the risk
2749344 well obviously theres going to be a lot of work and planning to do and ill try to speak with each sometime soon about what our goals should be
2749345 now id like to propose a toast to absent friends
2749346 more or less i had a lot of time in the infirmary to think then the ioa pulled this shit with carter then on earth
2749347 lets say that im not the only one unhappy and i got a few ideas to consider
2749348 you do realize you just took a pretty big risk there right what if someone had said no or worse said yes and then reported it
2749349 eh i knew i could trust you guys everyone but you and keller came with the first expedition and i knew you two wouldnt stab us in the back i figured that if this group wouldnt go for it no one would and id have to find some other way of doing things
2749350 listen uh if youre not comfortable with this just say something
2749351 no one will blame you hell it might even be a good idea for someone in command not to know
2749352 yeah that its not contingent on you helping out with this
2749353 unless it is for you i mean if you dont want me doing it that could be a problem im pretty much committed to this but i wouldnt want to lose us not after this long
2749354 john stop worrying im with you and i wouldnt try to come between you and atlantis any more than i would between you and your team
2749355 besides im already going to be violating air force instruction 36 2909 whats a little mutiny and treason
2749356 wait a second did you just suggest that its okay to break rules
2749357 you know just because i like having my life a bit more ordered than you doesnt mean i have a stick up my ass
2749358 no stop this is a serious conversation none of that right now
2749359 do you really think this will work theres a lot of things that could go wrong especially once we start involving more people
2749360 well i think we can rely on about half the population for sure
2749361 all the old timers came out here half expecting to found a colony most of the new ones have the same kind of frontier spirit and those who dont typically end up rotating home the first chance they get well need to screen people coming in a bit more carefully make sure they have the right attitude and well want to keep the actual um conspiracy sounds so evil rebel alliance
2749362 that works well keep our numbers down and recruit just the most trustworthy and essential personnel into the actual browncoats maybe have a few more people working for us who dont know it then when the time comes well be ready to secure the city i think most of the population will follow along but we can send everyone who doesnt want to stay back to earth or the milky way alpha site if we do it right no one even gets hurt
2749363 youre assuming its going to come to forced secession arent you
2749364 i wish it could happen some other way maybe by talking the ioa into giving us independence to maintain neutrality
2749365 elizabeth probably could have pulled that off but you and i both know its not going to happen anytime soon as things stand right now
2749366 honestly it was tempting to just tell the sgc that we werent letting them replace carter and be done with it
2749367 but even i know we cant go about this half assed we need time to get prepared especially if were going to do anything more than sit under the shield and think happy thoughts at the wraith
2749368 hmm well probably need to start thinking about who to bring in from the military youve known captain barnes for a while can he be trusted
2749369 alan yeah hed love this kind of thing im thinking miller too hes been with us from the start
2749370 jerry i want you to know that i still love you on day one when you and i talked
2749371 you can talk to me you can stay up here you can sleep in my bed until i go back down
2749372 us claims that the military surge is bringing stability to iraq
2749373 its done i screwed it up i cant go back

2749377 what learn to write complete sentences with punctuation and we might be able to answer you
2749378 today news reports indicate that russian military forces crossed an internationally recognized border into the sovereign territory of georgia russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory what is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
2749379 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
2749380 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected
2749381 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
2749382 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
2749383 mccain obviously took time to determine first that russia had indeed attacked georgia before demanding restraint from the victim its apparent that mccain has a better grasp of the situation and understood its ramifications as events unfolded obama issued a boilerplate statement that generically demanded that everyone start getting along and had to modify his stance as his 300 foreign policy advisers had a chance to tutor him on the conflict
2749384 id rather vote for the man who gets it right and has spent years studying foreign affairs warfare and american strategic needs than the man who makes it up as he goes along mccain is right this was a 3 am moment and obama proved himself unprepared and unsuited to answer the call
2749385 i like the way you touch me it makes me feel like i have no skeleton
2749386 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light

2749389 we have a track record of producing high performance juniors who then fail to make the transition into winners in the senior game
2749390 energise refocus and improve the junior and senior national club leagues and to
2749391 we want to modernise with a radical shift in the way we support our players parents and coaches
2749392 if you look at what young children have to contend with they are actually very busy these days
2749393 other countries like america and russia dont hinder their players because they dont leave room for error they pick kids as young as six and do not let them go school becomes a secondary thing and they dont look back
2749394 in late 1999 when i was 17 i wasnt doing all that well in the juniors and i was ready to go to college
2749395 my coach at the time tarik benhabiles said to me
2749396 in america you can get a college scholarship and play tennis to a pretty high standard james blake and john mcenroe both went through college at the same time and were able to play a high level of tennis while getting a decent education
2749397 in france they have something like 80 000 matches being played compared to around 9 000 in england for roughly the same number of kids playing
2749398 the clubs dont want them as it is the adults want to play on weekends
2749399 recently one of the girls i teach had her first tournament her mum drove her up there in all her new whites but nobody was there theyd cancelled through lack of juniors and nobody had bothered to phone her mother
2749400 he had five players playing in wimbledon that day i approached him and introduced myself and said i was a big fan of his coaching and he said come on buddy and we sat down for half an hour and chatted
2749401 that would never happen if he was english it would be more like oh go away you horrible little man its not the lta thats like that the whole of english tennis is a bit like that
2749402 when nadal was a young boy he used to play with carlos moya
2749403 that doesnt seem to happen here not that we have many professionals to play with that is part of the problem
2749404 you have to make it fun for the young ones
2749405 it is a difficult game and they try to do quite complicated skills compared to kicking a football which for a four year old is not particularly difficult
2749406 there are a lot more young kids competing now in mini tennis we have an aim of a minimum of 15 000 juniors competing by the end of september
2749407 you still have this problem of keeping kids into the game in their teens as most of them have tons of homework they find it really difficult to combine the hours of tennis and school time
2749408 if your kid comes up to you now and says
2749409 if it takes about 10 000 hours to produce a top class player which is about 10 hours a week from the age of about eight to 18 that is a heck of a lot of time needing to be invested particularly in this country where tennis and education cant be combined as well
2749410 there is this general property of religion its great at building community religion has been a good thing for many individuals it has brought them together and given them comfort but over all religion holds back humanity
2749411 that because for so many years people got smallpox smallpox is to be credited for all the virtue men have done
2749412 you have throughout your blog described catholics as stupid stupider scary dark age fanatics
2749413 you have insulted and hurt thousands of catholics what do you have to say for that
2749414 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it for what good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul
2749415 we told you so hiring tim brewster was a dumb idea he has never been a head coach he has never been a coordinator he is jim wacker without the drawl and the geezo beezo he said we were going to pasadena this year
2749416 were not 100 percent sure whether or not he has to have surgery
2749417 probably a pretty good chance well know in the morning if he has the surgery hes out for the rest of the year if he doesnt theres still a chance he could be out for the rest of the year

2749426 in 1886 in atlanta georgia dr john pemberton created a drink that was uniquely refreshing and uplifting he chose the best spices from around the world to create his secret formula the drink was called coca cola and to this day it contains no added preservatives or artificial flavours
2749427 to this day coca cola uses as an ingredient a coca leaf extract prepared by a stepan company plant in maywood new jersey using a process monitored by the drug enforcement administration because cocaine is naturally present in coca leaves todays coca cola uses spent or treated coca leaves those that have been through a cocaine extraction process to flavor the beverage some contend that this process cannot extract all of the cocaine alkaloids at a molecular level and so the drink still contains trace amounts of the stimulant the coca cola company currently refuses to comment on the continued presence of coca leaf in coca cola

2749454 congressional action would help us enormously to make sure it happens
2749455 by careful orchestration of these steps we can ultimately provide that these claimants would receive what are really unprecedented payouts

2749457 this will provide the best opportunity for american claimants to receive fair compensation in an expedited manner and help turn the page on the last vestige of our contentious past with libya so that we can focus on the future of our relationship

2749522 there will be trouble but the firestorm that followed surprised even me
2749523 has become more accepting of womens roles and parenting in the wider society but once again women felt they were being handed a script for their lives that they couldnt follow
2749524 gives a woman only one role the single woman exists in the proclamation only as daughter of heavenly parents waiting to fulfill her destiny being a mother is a good and a necessary role but a good mother must first be a good person with roles and needs outside that of mother
2749525 we are fed up with the myth that its the most honorable and important thing we do and if you dont love every second of it there is something wrong with you
2749526 motherhood is prescribed essentially as the only role for women eternally
2749527 in many ways the only voice within the patriarchal structure of the church the weight falls on her to illustrate our experience
2749528 gap between becks rhetoric and some lds womens experience particularly as womens influence expands in the secular world
2749529 patriarchal systems use women as the primary tool for keeping other women in line
2749530 reflects the idea that its more acceptable to question womens authority than mens in the church
2749531 those who know the truth about motherhood versus secular women who are ruining the family
2749532 most women want to be good mothers and care deeply about their families
2749533 the mormon map for women is limited and can sometimes leave you feeling lost
2749534 a lot of it came down to feeling that i didnt belong in a singles ward or a family ward and my mother is worried because i havent married and procreated like my sisters my success isnt a grandchild
2749535 i learned integrity after being away for a while i realized i missed the gospel
2749536 with a new perspective ultimately im at church to learn how to become a disciple of christ
2749537 motherhood really is meaningless unless there is a person being the mother in the first place
2749538 not my liberal friends who were most upset they just tend to disregard her
2749539 it was my deeply conservative friends who believe every word out of a churchs leaders mouth came from jesus christ they locked themselves in the bathroom and cried about it
2749540 free pass to pursue a tenure track job once people in the church found out why i didnt have kids they were very sympathetic and i was given a real place in every ward ive ever been in
2749541 i felt i was being incorporated into the structure with an identity apart from other women that was fine but i didnt realize that identity was contingent on my remaining childless
2749542 erasure of a significant portion of my identity when i became a mother
2749543 a skeleton architecture for building an identity for women in the church in part through its young women program which emphasizes values such as faith knowledge good works and integrity
2749544 i wish i were on this panel im the mother of five im not a ph d candidate and thats not in my future
2749545 always had a very confident sense of self and i attribute that to being raised in the church i feel powerful i dont need anything more than what i do but i want that mutual respect
2749546 i want to know that if i were in the toscano family there wouldnt be little remarks about me behind closed doors
2749547 to emulate me maybe without letters after their name its not something small im teaching i ask you to show the same respect for me

2749550 music is the arithmetic of sounds as optics is the geometry of light
2749551 after silence that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music
2749552 music is a hidden arithmetic exercise of the soul which does not know that it is dealing with numbers because it does many things by way of unnoticed conceptions which with clear conception it could not do
2749553 music is not deception but revelation its unique power is to reveal to us elements of beauty which are not accessible by other means the contemplation of which reconciles us to our lives not just for the moment but for ever

2749566 the bush administration did not see afghanistan as a long term commitment and its leaders deceived themselves into thinking they had won an irreversible victory they did not consider afghanistan important and always intended to focus on iraq
2749567 now the u s and international community have fallen way behind and the taliban are winning strategically even if we defeat them in every tactical engagement
2749568 weve grown in our commitment to afghanistan by putting another brigade of troops here and with that we know that were going to have an enduring presence
2749569 so this is going to become a long term base for us whether that means five years 10 years we dont know

2749572 asking this court to in essence amend the bill of rights by giving it an interpretation that would deprive it of any real meaning this court declines to do so
2749573 has upheld both the tradition of judicial independence and our nations most cherished principle of the right to be secure in ones own home
2749574 this is as clear a violation of the fourth amendment as youll ever find
2749575 it represents another judicial repudiation of this administrations terrorist surveillance policies
2749576 were going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good
2749577 its time for a new beginning for an end to government of the few by the few and for the few and to replace it with shared responsibility for shared prosperity
2749578 we cant just let business as usual go on and that means something has to be taken away from some people
2749579 we have to build a political consensus and that requires people to give up a little bit of their own in order to create this common ground
2749580 i think its time to send a clear message to what has become the most profitable sector in the entire economy that they are being watched
2749581 between 4pm and midnight we took about 800 calls in total probably 600 of those would be flooding calls
2749582 weve never had anything like that we wouldnt generally get that many calls on halloween
2749583 people would be ringing up saying their houses are flooded and there was water on the roads
2749584 there was a river flowing down collins avenue east clontarf
2749585 there was a girl in the car there who said the water was coming in it was up to her knees and she was floating down the road in a bmw it the car was being swept down the street
2749586 one fella rang up and said the water was coming in his house door
2749587 it wasnt an immediate threat but then he rang back an hour later and said it was up to the second step of the stairs and i have four kids here and its getting up to the electrics and he needed to be rescued
2749588 we had a really really busy night with crews working in extremely difficult conditions until after 1am in the morning and they were back on duty at 6am
2749589 people actually came back off holidays to work on those crews
2749590 very senior people in the council were all mobilised and came back to hq
2749591 its the worst rainfall and flooding arising from it in decades this wasnt tidal this arose directly from what fell from the sky
2749592 due to the unprecedented amount of rain that has fallen over the last 24 hours the current state of the showgrounds the health and safety of visitors and the welfare of show animals the executive committee are bitterly disappointed to announce that this years tullamore show and aib national livestock show has been cancelled

2749600 singh is kinng has had a phenomenal response the weekend is sold out
2749601 the occupancy is likely to be about 95 per cent over the weekend earning nearly rs 3 crore for us
2749602 the occupancy was slightly lower than expected due to the number of shows across multiplexes on friday however singh is kinng has opened to an extremely positive word of mouth and we expect occupancies of 70 75 per cent over the weekend it is a proper mass entertainer and is set for a long innings at the box office
2749603 singh is kinng is estimated to fetch over rs 40 crore in the first week
2749604 the film has had a strong opening in the north clearly because of the content the film has fared well at an all india level as well singh is kinng was the only big ticket movie that was released on friday and with the increase in the number of screens the movie is likely beat the record of other blockbusters
2749605 we need help to save our communities and businesses and above all else we want water to save our river and environment
2749606 all we want is our political leaders to have the fortitude the will to release some of it to save the lower lakes
2749607 all it will do is buy a little bit of time before the same problem recurs
2749608 the recent council of australian governments agreement did not aim to fix it quickly it simply put off the decisions until 2018
2749609 ultimately what has to be provided is an environmental flow an allocation of water that is available for the environment every year not just in dire straits
2749610 it could have a significant chilling effect on the reporting of the private lives of celebrities
2749611 the most significant changes to the privacy act in the 20 years of its existence
2749612 there is a strong expectation that special minister of state senator john faulkner will commit the government to act on the alrcs recommendations and that he will introduce relevant legislative amendments in the foreseeable future
2749613 protection of privacy needs to be balanced against the public interest in allowing the free flow of information and upholding freedom of speech
2749614 it has not been demonstrated that existing privacy protections fail to achieve this balance
2749615 the alrc has failed to demonstrate a breach of privacy by the media is not already dealt with by existing laws such as defamation and surveillance laws or self regulation by the media
2749616 the law would be irrelevant to ordinary citizens in whom the media has no interest it would be open to abuse by irresponsible claimants who would clog our already over burdened courts
2749617 such a law would simply allow rich people to employ lawyers in a bid to avoid scrutiny of their wrongdoing
2749618 it allows the rich powerful and celebrities to manipulate their images in the way they want them manipulated rather than having some transparency
2749619 they said privacy laws would be ok on the whole if anyone with a pr agent was exempt from taking an action
2749620 i think it may be a sensible development for the media as it would mean the defamation laws dont get stretched to be used as a substitute for proper protection against invasion of privacy
2749621 the snow settled this morning but its just wet now
2749622 there were a couple of cars that needed to be helped out of the snow but there was no real emergency
2749623 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds and authorising their emplacement across the province
2749624 we need to go to the facilities where these devices are constructed you could call them ied factories and we need to go after the people who are putting them together and thats precisely what weve been doing
2749625 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently under way what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province
2749626 yet another example of the good work theyre doing in oruzgan
2749627 i think in terms of the brand there is an impact
2749628 because of that movie 20 years ago everyone remembers that qantas was the safest airline every conversation you have about qantas safety that movie is mentioned so there is no doubt there has been damage to the brand
2749629 the brand is pure australian and so there is this incredible emotional feeling about this australian brand
2749630 travel is an emotional experience and the big emotional connection with qantas was safety
2749631 in the early qantas ads back in the 80s we always used to get the camera to linger on the uniformed pilots showing them as the man in charge and giving the perception that you were in safe hands
2749632 it has that sense of being put on a pedestal i think that qantas is held to a higher standard both in terms of engineering and from a staff perspective
2749633 they are expected to smile and to make it a nice experience
2749634 five years ago the only thing that would have been reported in the news would have been the explosion of the oxygen bottle
2749635 we have seen a lot of incidents that would not have been reported
2749636 qantas has still certainly got to be one of the safest airlines in the world
2749637 it will take a long time for it to be held so far above any other airline
2749638 they are still seen as one of the safest airlines in the world but may not be the benchmark any more there is no doubt no doubt
2749639 you have got to believe that qantas has safety at the very very top of its list of priorities
2749640 but airlines are like banks they run 80 per cent on confidence and it is very easy to knock that confidence
2749641 at ansett there were a couple of very serious issues but then that led to coverage of a lot more minor stuff
2749642 i think that when you have a brand or a reputation that is as highly regarded as qantas no matter what industry you are in you are always open for criticism
2749643 clearly while we are going through some turbulent times in the media the bottom line is our brand is still strong
2749644 qantas is safe was always safe and continues to be safe and we will not allow it to be otherwise
2749645 to me if you think you can address questions of safety issues with an advertising campaign it is trivialising it and you are not going to see us trivialising safety
2749646 i have been here 35 years and seen many things in qantas and safety has been etched in my mind from day one
2749647 i look out my window every day and see planes of all airlines aborting take offs and landings
2749648 but the brand is still pretty strong and australians love it
2749649 there has not been much comment coming from qantas to smooth things over
2749650 they are trying to continue to live on reputation and that is dangerous
2749651 you tell me who the worlds second safest airline is
2749652 this was the year the stroller became an extension of my body the year i became aware i didnt exist the year i made food and people ate it mopped the floors and people walked on them cleaned the toilets and well you get it its textbook but betty friedan was not required reading for my english degree i didnt know how awful it would feel
2749653 one work shift consists of 12 hours and even if they do two shifts theyre already done four extra hours
2749654 but the moment working hours start to come to the notice of the authorities it starts to become verydifficult for students because they are only allowed to work 20 hours a week
2749655 the working hours should be up to the students and the institutions
2749656 if the student can study full time and is performing well academically then yes they can work more than 20 hours if they cant perform well in their studies then they shouldnt work more than 20 hours
2749657 the new government should be reviewing this working policy but the aim should be to provide more flexibility and more rights in terms of how much students want to work and how much they want to study
2749658 taxi owners like all employers are responsible for ensuring that overseas workers including students abide by their visa conditions
2749659 the commander in chief and those under him authorized a systematic regime of torture the only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account
2749660 the ranking members of the senate and house intelligence committees were briefed dozens of times about the cias interrogation and detention program over the past seven years so any member who has held one of those posts including speaker pelosi would find it very hard at this point to point the finger at the white house without also implicating themselves

2749669 i can reassure you that the defense department is hard at work on this issue

2749679 suddenly there was a massive explosion which hit a house down the road from us
2749680 our windows shattered and i jumped for cover i grabbed my son and wife and ran down to the basement where i was joined by dozens of other civilians the bombing only got worse it was relentless and went on for hours i never thought it would come to this georgians bombing us not in my wildest imagination

2749684 grad missiles are falling they are taking the city we are running out of ammunition wheres our f ing help
2749685 it all happened so quickly suddenly we were in the middle of heavy fighting i saw our neighbours house get a direct hit i took cover with the kids in the basement it was terrifying
2749686 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
2749687 i was in the hospital on friday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet
2749688 russia will not close its eyes on the deaths of russian citizens in south ossetia

2749695 it is very disappointing here you have this designation as a monument and there has been less visible activity going on in the monument
2749696 it is wonderful that our nation has made a commitment and this administration deserves a lot of credit for designating the worlds largest marine reserve but there is a responsibility that goes along with that
2749697 unfortunately in recent years the u s has not made picking up trash in our most special places in the ocean a priority
2749698 decided to reduce its level of commitment to removing marine debris and only address new accumulations
2749699 the administration is not keeping pace and this is disappointing
2749700 additional cleanup and prevention resources are needed to protect this marine national monument

2749709 celebrated the funeral masses of deceased priests without fail unless i was out of the archdiocese or fulfilling an archdiocesan commitment that could not be changed
2749710 he was smart challenging gave great sermons but you didnt want to be on his bad side
2749711 intense relationships between faculty and students were permitted to exist both for priests and lay teachers
2749712 wally had to walk a fine line keeping people from leaving but not being critical of emmy moore
2749713 we all thought he was overdue to become a bishop
2749714 he always seemed to have the inside track but he kept just going around and around
2749715 he was always smooth but he could also be very candid
2749716 the other problem though he said was how too many innocent people innocent priests were getting swept up in these accusations
2749717 i am beyond words trying to describe how people feel about this
2749718 its always different when you know somebody but this just brings home for me what he was saying in his testimony how sometimes innocent people do get swept up

2749726 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2749727 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2749728 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2749729 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2749730 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2749744 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2749745 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2749746 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2749805 from the time that iran halted the suspension of its centrifuge manufacturing efforts and its adherence to the additional protocol the iaeas knowledge of irans centrifuge manufacturing complex has degraded dramatically u s and other intelligence agencies appear to have only partial information about irans centrifuge complex and its ability to reconstitute its program following an attack irans decision to disperse and keep secret several of its key sites further hinders the development of a full picture of its centrifuge complex considering the modular replicable nature of centrifuge plants we conclude that an attack on irans nuclear program is unlikely to significantly degrade irans ability to reconstitute its gas centrifuge program
2749806 given that harper collins sold a american gods was out there with sales of all my titles up 40 through independent bookshops i think i can safely say that well be doing it or rather something similar again
2749807 i understand that people want it to be true that giving away ebooks significantly boosts print sales im just not convinced that a case has been clearly made that it is in fact generally true and i wont be convinced until there are a lot more hard numbers

2749814 at the moment it seems to be a lot of posturing and the two sides showing each other how big their guns are
2749815 i hope the violence can end before any more people are killed
2749816 though there were areas of overlap we found that common motivations for self benefit included interaction with the birds a sense of achievement social interaction personal stimulation and enjoyment
2749817 past research shows that people take part in wildlife activities for many reasons and so require a sophisticated level of management our findings reinforce that
2749818 though self satisfaction motivations were mentioned most often people also had many unselfish reasons for taking part in conservation including helping this vulnerable species preserving nature for future generations and serving the community
2749819 with declining budgets most wildlife agencies are not well equipped to manage the growing number of species at risk so they are depending more on volunteers to help with wildlife management operations

2749828 we used to feel bad about the fact that although the biggest bollywood films have punjabi songs story and characters but when we look towards the punjabi films and cinema we had not achieved as much
2749829 my biggest motivation for doing this film was that for the first time a sensible director had started making good sensible punjabi films who besides having a vast experience in film making was in love with punjab and his mother tongue he was not making a film out of any motive like to make quick profit but was making a film with an aim to take punjabi films to a new height
2749830 weve been knocking on the door for the last couple of races today we put it all together an excellent car terrific driving perfect pit stops and strategy i want to thank all our sponsors and porsche motorsport for all their support congratulations to our crew and engineers and a special thanks to mike evans and mike spinti for providing us with superb strategy in their first race with us we feel now the team is poised for more success

2749832 but that was really an awesome race the key that put us in the position to win was the pit strategy we came from fifth to second on the last caution when everybody pitted then the car was really good nobody other than mika and i could go the pace in the end im really proud we managed to get our first win in our first alms season with farnbacher loles

2749855 children need to be able to hear not just in the classroom but also because hearing affects language competence cognitive development social and emotional well being and academic achievement
2749856 children who cannot hear well that is when their hearing loss is untreated or under treated could face a life of underperformance and broken dreams
2749857 based on our findings i am concerned that a sizeable population of young people in america is being left behind because they do not fit existing paradigms of hearing disability
2749858 we need a fundamental re examination of the current hearing health policies and protocols influencing americas children with hearing loss
2749859 the findings of this study come as a shrill reminder that parents healthcare providers and educators must thoroughly address a childs hearing loss if we are to allow that child a fair and equitable opportunity for success
2749860 moreover it provides an impetus for further dialogue among parents educators healthcare providers and policymakers on how we can better serve our children with hearing loss
2749861 are 1 million dependents in america with hearing loss being left behind
2749862 they saved thousands of dollars and they were just as happy
