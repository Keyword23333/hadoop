8030000 what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8030001 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8030002 to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8030003 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8030004 this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8030005 in the middle ages uninformed and inadequate theories about embryology led some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy
8030006 while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8030007 these mistaken biological theories became obsolete over 150 years ago when scientists discovered that a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8030008 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8030009 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion

8030120 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8030121 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8030122 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8030123 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start

8030219 s lamentablemente me da mucha pena saber que me saco el aire en este pa s y realmente no se puede a m me da mucho coraje saber que dejo a mi familia tanto tiempo para al final saber que se da una clasificaci n por equipo dios quiera que eso pueda cambiar porque me da mucho coraje de sacarme el aire y no poder clasificar
8030220 yo espero que en estos cuatro a os que vienen ecuador tiene que trabajar para tener un equipo porque ya son dos olimpiadas y que vuelva pasar lo mismo como que hay una sedelina que esta desmotivada
8030221 mal hacen fijando precios si no se controlan los alt simos costos de los insumos para producir
8030222 si las autoridades que tienen que ver con el control de la calidad y con el precio de los insumos no se hacen presente para controlarlo entonces mal hacen fijando precios m nimos de sustentaci n que finalmente saben que no cubren los costos reales de producci n
8030223 me parece que el precio el 28 d lares es un precio referencial y tiende a hacerle justicia al productor ya que en tiempos atr s los precios sub an y bajaban antes si no hab a cosecha los precios se deprim an tanto y no hab an ganancias por lo menos ahora hay un precio de referencia
8030224 yo como agricultor y productor veo que la capacidad de compra que tiene el pueblo no es la que le permite comprar arroz a 35 o 40 d lares los precios tienen que mantenerse en niveles alcanzables para la poblaci n

8030229 ik begrijp nog wel dat ik ondertekend heb het ging over vrijheid van meningsuiting en zo maar ik w t het niet meer
8030230 als het blijkt te kloppen ontstaat er een heel moeilijke situatie dan moet ze maar eens gaan nadenken over de toekomst
8030231 ik wil niet op de zaken vooruit lopen maar mocht het kloppen dan voorspel ik politiek zwaar weer
8030232 minister cramer distantieert zich nadrukkelijk van de advertentie en stelt zelfs nooit toestemming te hebben gegeven voor de ondertekening met haar naam daarmee is de zaak voor de pvda afgedaan
8030233 de kraakbeweging is de laatste jaren enorm verhard er is een enorme toestroom van mensen van buiten onze grenzen er is een sterke toename van criminaliteit intimidatie en geweld rondom kraakpanden
8030234 landelijk gezien is er geen sprake van woningnood en zelf in grootstedelijk gebied zijn woningen beschikbaar
8030235 wie dit beweert kletst echt uit zijn nek er is op tal van plaatsen sprake van een tekort aan woningen
8030236 in veel gemeenten wordt nauwelijks gekraakt in nijmegen slechts twee keer in vijf jaar dit voorstel cre ert alleen maar meer bureaucratie met de huidige wetten tegen kraken en leegstand kunnen gemeenten prima uit de voeten we moeten niet aanscherpen maar handhaven

8030244 wat we hebben gezien in kasjmir is het begin van niet gewelddadige massademonstraties
8030245 in arnhem is gebleken dat je de eerste goal moet scoren om kans te maken op de overwinning
8030246 vanavond gaan we voor die eerste treffer we starten weer op 0 0
8030247 ik denk dat we arsenal met name in de eerste helft verrast hebben en een hoog niveau hebben gespeeld na afloop realiseerden de spelers zich dat ze een kans hadden arsenal te verslaan al overheerste de teleurstelling uiteraard
8030248 het is voor jonge spelers een fantastische ervaring hier wordt iedere speler beter van we moeten er van genieten
8030249 we hebben goed werk verricht bij twente maar de klus is nog niet geklaard
8030250 we moeten respect hebben voor twente en de wedstrijd ingaan met de wil om te winnen
8030251 en ik geloof in de spelers die we al hebben e n speler maakt niet het verschil je moet als team karakter tonen
8030252 as se est n dando las cosas no se puede hacer nada m s que esperar porque la gente de afuera no puede venir antes

8030257 my understanding was this early practice wasnt going to happen
8030258 if something other than that occurred i would be surprised and disappointed
8030259 with the exception of when hes on a lot of drugs
8030260 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8030261 yeah my dad can be that guy but its not all of him
8030262 so this is more like a talking book a really thorough autobiography
8030263 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion
8030264 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that
8030265 for the most part generally hes more often than not not a complete idiot most of the time
8030266 i actually feel guilty that america has exported our fat hatred pretty quickly around the world i wanted to create a kind of peaceful event to counter it the crane was an obvious symbol to me because i understand the incredibly peaceful symbolism they convey and hey im sure there are cranes of all sizes out there
8030267 i did some research and found out how to fold a fat origami sparrow but no cranes

8030269 its taken some time for me to get ready for my appointment with the goddess who lives beneath the ocean ever since i was a little girl i have avoided all kinds of deep water fearing that i would be swept away into a sea of destructive emotion and then the goddess quan yin appeared it was she who invited me to open my heart and leave this troubled world for a more heavenly destination lemuria a continent destroyed by atlantis a long long time ago floating now in a dimension far beneath the pacific lemuria a civilization that has mystically reemerged and where even today peace prevails
8030270 i cashed in my iras sold my luxurious east fifties brownstone and the black saab convertible i was nervous about driving in new york city anyway i dumped my overstuffed chanel makeup bag and montblanc pens
8030271 now my body is composed of rivers of moving light i swim right alongside her majesty an island floats like a fetus in the distance protected from every angle by an aura of sacredness although it is far away it is massive as we approach i make out a pyramid positioned in the center surrounded by palm trees and white stone structures there are tender gardenia scented breezes and fields of golden wheat blowing in the warm wind we are moving closer a feeling comes over me something old and familiar i know i have been here before this is lemuria the ending and the beginning
8030272 when i finally began to open my eyes and hope for a bigger saner world an immortal tiger appeared

8030275 in het leger weet iedereen ongeveer wie de vijand is bij de politie niet als een politieman iemand aanhoudt en vraagt naar zijn rijbewijs dan kan hij in het ergste geval een pistool voor zijn kanis krijgen ik blijf dan naast mijn politieman staan ga achteraf een bak koffie drinken en vraag wat er aan de hand was en of hij de schrik een beetje te boven is gekomen hij is zich natuurlijk lam geschrokken

8030278 ik heb niets tegen russen als russen en polen elkaar in west europa tegenkomen dan blijkt altijd dat ze juist heel goed met elkaar overweg kunnen maar rusland als land is gevaarlijk
8030279 een gelaat dat wij al honderden jaren kennen dat land denkt dat de tijden van het ingestorte imperium terugkomen en dat het domineren van andere landen opnieuw kenmerkend zal zijn voor deze regio
8030280 we moeten ervoor zorgen dat landen als georgi oekra ne moldavi en de centraal aziatische republieken voor ons model kiezen voor democratie en vrije markt
8030281 europa doet echter niets met als gevolg dat rusland vrij spel heeft met zijn autoritaire model

8030296 in nederland wordt een veroordeelde nadat hij zijn straf heeft uitgezeten vroeg of laat gewoon weer een deelnemer van deze maatschappij onze rechtsorde is nooit bedoeld om die man tot aan zijn dood met in het verleden gepleegde daden hoe vreselijk ook te blijven volgen hij heeft immers zijn straf gehad
8030297 maar hij is berecht in arnhem en zat zijn straf in die regio uit daarna mag hij gaan en staan waar hij wil zolang daar door de rechter geen voorwaarden aan zijn gesteld zoals een proeftijd of gedwongen hulpverlening hij is niet verplicht om het openbaar ministerie of de rechtbank te melden dat hij verhuist het om krijgt geen verhuisberichten van ex delinquenten want in dit geval ging het nog om een ex delinquent nu blijkt met deze nieuwe arrestatie dat hij mogelijk heeft gerecidiveerd en zich opnieuw aan kinderen heeft vergrepen als hij wordt veroordeeld door de rechter kunnen deze keer mogelijk extra voorwaarden aan zijn straf en vrijlating worden gesteld een rechter kan bij een recidivist bijvoorbeeld kiezen voor een hogere voorwaardelijke straf met langere proeftijd en extra gedwongen hulp en reclassering waardoor hij langer in het vizier van justitie blijft als hij verhuist moet hij dat melden
8030298 sinds 1 juli van dit jaar kan de officier van justitie ook voorwaarden stellen bij de vrijlating van een veroordeelde die het grootste deel van zijn gevangenisstraf er op heeft zitten in het kader van de voorwaardelijke invrijheidstelling maar ook in dit geval geldt zodra zijn straf voorbij is met alle voorwaarden is hij volgens de wet gewoon weer een nederlandse burger als ieder ander
8030299 de officier van justitie heeft een formulier in de computer de zogenoemde executie indicator waarin de aanklager adviseert over wat er met de verdachte moet gebeuren tijdens en na de eventuele straf daarin kan het om ook aantekenen wie ge nformeerd moet worden bij een voorwaardelijke vrijlating maar nogmaals het gaat hier om een advies aan het ministerie van justitie niemand is verplicht zich daar aan te houden zoals een rechter zich ook niet per se hoeft te houden aan de strafeis van de aanklager het om doet een voorstel maar de rechter is in nederland onafhankelijk en kan die strafeis terzijde schuiven
8030300 tijdens het proces doen we dat in beginsel altijd erna gebeurt dat alleen als het slachtoffer dat wenst want niet iedereen wil na een zware emotionele rechtszaak telkens geconfronteerd worden met de dader die hem of haar zoveel leed heeft berokkend sommige mensen willen verder met hun leven en alles afsluiten anderen verwerken dat proces door juist op de hoogte te blijven
8030301 als iemand is veroordeeld en zich na een verhuizing inschrijft in een andere gemeente kan het zoals dat in nederland is geregeld nooit de bedoeling zijn dat er achter zijn naam in de gemeentelijke administratie staat dat hij een ex zedendelinquent is om vervolgens via een ambtenaar te horen dat hij niet in een bepaalde wijk mag komen wonen dat zou betekenen dat zijn verleden hem altijd zal blijven volgen ook al heeft hij na zijn veroordeling nooit meer iets misdaan
8030302 we kunnen niet in een glazen bol kijken of iemand gaat recidiveren kon dat maar dan konden we misdrijven beter voorkomen we maken wel een risicoprofiel van iemand ondersteund met alle informatie die het om tot zijn beschikking heeft zoals psychiatrische of psychologische rapporten aan de hand daarvan schetsen we een profiel waaruit blijkt of iemand een blijvend risico voor de samenleving is of dat iemand misschien wel helemaal geen verder gevaar oplevert maar ook dit komt naar voren tijdens de rechtsgang en ook hier weer geldt dat de rechter uiteindelijk bepaalt wat er met die informatie wordt gedaan
8030303 een werkgever kan dan met zon verklaring zelf bepalen of hij iemand wel of niet aanneemt zo krijgen ex delinquenten die voor kindermisbruik zijn veroordeeld vaak geen baan als het gaat om werken met kinderen maar deze verklaring gaat niet op voor huisvesting een woningcorporatie of gemeente mag zon verklaring niet aanvragen om te bepalen of iemand ergens mag wonen dat is alleen voor een werkgever die de antecedenten van sollicitanten wil checken
8030304 ook al gaan wij niet over de handhaving van de openbare orde want daar gaan politie en gemeente over we doen wel ons best om het gevoel van veiligheid in de wijk bij zon zaak te vergroten
8030305 daar hebben we uitgelegd wat de taken van het om zijn en wat de on mogelijkheden zodat de burger weet waar ze bij ons aan toe zijn justitie heeft echter geen offici le afspraak met de gemeente dat wij hen altijd of alleen bij zware ex zedendelinquenten moeten informeren
8030306 bij deze gesprekken blijven de principi le vragen overeind wie informeert wie wanneer hoe en waarom en niet te vergeten over wie want dat mensen geen ex zedendelinquenten in hun straat willen dat weten we maar geldt het ook voor een moordenaar die iemands hoofd insloeg of voor een inbreker die precies weet hoe hij in je huis kan komen zonder dat je het doorhebt als we zo door blijven redeneren kan straks iemand die ooit iets verkeerd heeft gedaan nooit meer ergens terecht daarover moeten we eerst eens goed met elkaar praten
8030307 vroeger gingen we uit van het idee dat de burgemeester geen informatie wil als hij of zij er niets mee kan nu na verschillende incidenten blijkt dat dit niet altijd opgaat

8030311 we bevelen aan om bij slecht weer een bijpassende regenhoes te gebruiken want het materiaal is wel waterdicht maar net als bij de meeste tassen de stiksels en ritsen niet

8030318 does mi5s behavioural science unit really believe that if the ideology of extreme islamism did not exist the people who blew themselves up on july 7 2005 would have found another justification for it and done it anyway
8030319 people in mi5 tell me that denying the connection between islamism and terrorism derives from the belief that if you accept it theres no hope for a multicultural society in britain we would just have to recognise that part of the population is permanently liable to become terrorists

8030344 i would suggest that shows another soft on drugs attitude of this government
8030345 i would not think a member of a former party involved with cannabis sends a very good message well see what he does as a magistrate but my view is we cannot take a soft on drugs attitude
8030346 this is about protecting our community and taking the issue of drugs seriously rather than treat it as a joke the way labor has since 2001
8030347 over the past seven years labor has had ample opportunity to fix drug and related law and order issues but it has instead turned a blind eye
8030348 it gave a sense that somehow drugs are acceptable i dont think they are acceptable

8030393 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s

8030395 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
8030396 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
8030397 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
8030398 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
8030399 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
8030400 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
8030401 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
8030402 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
8030403 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
8030404 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes

8030498 we also dont know the extent of the outbreak yet and its really too soon to know now that coupled with the long incubation period makes this outbreak very concerning
8030499 both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues

8030511 the 2007 elections in scotland brought the shortcomings of the current system into sharp focus
8030512 the recommendations in this report are based on the findings of the gould report and the lessons we have learned from the 2007 elections including the importance of ensuring that electoral law is finalised six months before an election
8030513 we are disappointed that the electoral commission does not support the view of the scottish parliament that the conduct of elections in scotland should be the responsibility of holyrood in order to ensure a much higher degree of accountability for their efficient organisation and conduct
8030514 we will of course consider all of the commissions proposals in detail

8030565 an orchestrated campaign against my private members bill c 484 the unborn victims of crime act has now been followed by the governments announcement that they will unveil new legislation that will include a victims pregnancy as an aggravating factor when judges consider sentencing offenders
8030566 in my view it is unfortunate that they have made this decision
8030567 abortion supporters welcomed the introduction in may of liberal mp brent st
8030568 the saddest thing of all is that the government bill likely adds nothing that doesnt already exist in law my own legal advisors and the justice department have assured me that pregnancy is already deemed an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes as part of our case law
8030569 by simply treating pregnancy as an aggravating factor without recognizing a second victim in the crime we reinforce the offensive notion that the unborn childs fate is irrelevant

8030572 i know the critics of c 484 will continue to spread misinformation but i continue to hope that thoughtful everyday canadians not influenced by political agendas or strident ideology will continue to support c 484 and about 70 of canadians do including the vast majority of women across the country i hope they will continue to contact their mps now more than ever and encourage them to continue to support a compassionate and just response to the horrible loss experienced by pregnant women who lose their not yet born babies in a violent attack and i hope as a result mps regardless of party affiliation will have the courage to vote in favour of bill c 484 at third reading

8030894 well if this party has a message it has done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
8030895 right now like i say we are playing hide the message pretty good
8030896 theres no message coming out of here there is no sense that the party has a sense of urgency and weve only got four nights this is 25 of the whole thing
8030897 yeah early in my career i was doing better than i thought i didnt think i was going to go up in the rankings that quickly but now theres definitely been parts to this year where i think
8030898 now im like 54 sic hes ranked 55 maybe earlier this summer i was ranked 37 so you want to be ranked up there in the 30s because it makes a difference for the end of the year you get into paris and madrid indoor events ons surfaces favorable to querreys big game the two masters series and it would be nice for me ideally id like to start 09 seeded for the australian open

8030900 i think im going to start doing that from now on i dont know i think sometimes its easier to kind of that first game can you kind of swing freely and if you lose it you lose it youre still on serve but its kind of strange to start off because i broke him the first game and the third game and then he broke me the fourth game i think so three out of four breaks those first four games is odd especially with us we both have pretty big serves but i dont know you just have to just stay with it that can happen

8030917 saben los representantes del r gimen que nosotros contamos con una tica distinta a la de ellos jam s hemos actuado sin que sea una justa respuesta por lo que m s adecuado ser a que no se siga actuando como lo est n haciendo en contra de los ciudadanos y sobre todo con los luchadores sociales
8030918 que el gobierno del ileg timo felipe calder n hinojosa los presente de inmediato e informe a los medios de comunicaci n a las organizaciones no gubernamentales de derechos humanos a las organizaciones sociales y pol ticas de oposici n y al pueblo en general el estado f sico y ps quico en que est n y el lugar en donde se encuentran detenidos nuestros militantes
8030919 jam s ha sido f cil enfrentar una detenci n de compa eros para la familia y amigos menos para la estructura a la que pertenec an los detenidos por lo que el comit del valle de m xico conciente de lo que esto significa se pone a la disposici n de la direcci n de nuestro partido para realizar las actividades que determinen
8030920 estos son los rostros de nuestros compa eros raymundo rivera bravo y edmundo reyes amaya detenidos desaparecidos por las fuerzas represivas del estado mexicano el 25 de mayo del a o en curso cuyo secuestro e ilegal detenci n sigue siendo negada por las distintas autoridades de los diferentes niveles el r gimen encabezado por el ileg timo felipe calder n est develando su verdadero rostro el rostro del fascismo
8030921 desde la frontera norte hasta la frontera sur de nuestra patria encontramos ejemplos lamentables como estos no s lo en las d cadas mencionadas sino en los m s recientes per odos de gobierno incluyendo el de fox y ahora el de felipe calder n sin que hasta ahora los pasados y actuales gobernantes primero del pri y ahora del pan se hayan preocupado por esclarecer presentar y liberar a los cientos de desaparecidos por razones pol ticas cu ntos delincuentes organizados son protegidos por los representantes del poder estatal o federal en turno es por esto que nuestro comit estatal se une a la demanda y exigencia de presentaci n con vida de nuestros compa eros y de todos los presos y desaparecidos pol ticos que se encuentran en alg n centro de reclusi n y de tortura clandestino de los que el estado niega tener y que todos los luchadores sociales sabemos existen en todo el territorio nacional igualmente exhortamos a todo el explotado y oprimido a continuar con la organizaci n difusi n y defensa de las demandas m s sentidas de nuestro pueblo
8030922 cu ntos a os han pasado y cu ntos pasar n esto ltimo no lo sabemos lo que s sabemos es que por muchos a os que pasen a nuestros seres queridos no los olvidaremos jam s nuestros desaparecidos asesinados y presos desde la ya para unos lejana d cada de los 70 para nosotros parece que fue ayer es por eso que ahora que dos m s de nuestros compa eros de lucha se encuentran desaparecidos sentimos c mo nuestros corazones se estremecen al recordar aquella d cada y su guerra sucia nuestro pueblo de guerrero se une a la condena de la desaparici n forzada de los luchadores sociales en el territorio nacional por lo que exigimos al gobierno de ulises ruiz gobernador repudiado por el pueblo de oaxaca y al usurpador de la presidencia de la rep blica mexicana felipe calder n hinojosa presenten de manera inmediata a todos los luchadores sociales que se encuentran en las c rceles clandestinas y cuarteles militares
8030923 ante la detenci n de nuestros militantes en oaxaca informamos al comit central que las estructuras del partido y ej rcito en nuestro estado nos encontramos agrupados como la circunstancia lo amerita y cada uno de los militantes y combatientes con la disposici n a recibir rdenes para actuar como se nos indique por lo que solicitamos a nuestras m ximas instancias de partido y ej rcito que determinen ya como proceder
8030924 informamos a nuestro pueblo al bur pol tico y al comit central que dadas las circunstancias se ha hecho el recuento de fuerzas y cada compa ero y estructura se encuentra ocupando su lugar correspondiente conscientes de que este momento demanda una estricta disciplina como producto de las convicciones revolucionarias nos reportamos en completa disposici n a las rdenes que dispongan la comandancia general y el comit central dispuestos a asumir los retos que demande la presente etapa de lucha a nuestro pueblo le preguntamos qu hacer ante la euforia de ultraderecha ante la ofensiva policiaco militar resistencia organizada combinando todas las formas de lucha o resignaci n poniendo la otra mejilla
8030925 el comit estatal del pdpr epr del estado de chiapas manifiesta que con el pretexto del combate a la delincuencia organizada y narcotr fico el gobierno de la ultraderecha representada por felipe calder n hinojosa intenta contener toda manifestaci n de oposici n a su r gimen mediante acciones fascistas asesoradas por las diferentes estructuras de inteligencia extranjeras representadas por los gobiernos m s sanguinarios de este siglo entre ellos el norteamericano el espa ol y el israel demandamos enf ticamente del comit central y bur pol tico que tome en sus manos directamente el caso de oaxaca y que determinen las decisiones correspondientes porque la militancia como dice la consigna estamos presentes y resueltos a vencer consideramos que el deber de todo militante de todo revolucionario es identificarnos en la acci n como producto de las convicciones ideol gicas son tiempo de unidad tanto en el terreno revolucionario como en la lucha popular
8030926 los compa eros aprehendidos que siguen siendo torturados fueron a causa de un se alamiento aclaramos la fuerza est en la prudencia todo lo hemos resuelto privilegiando soluciones pol ticas pero tambi n el pueblo nos ha dado el derecho de la autodefensa por lo tanto podr amos cambiar de t ctica y si en esta t ctica de autodefensa la hacemos como tales agotando la soluci n pol tica y dando otro paso
8030927 hemos recibido de todos nuestros comit s estatales y regionales la disposici n de recibir rdenes por lo que se ordena a todo militante y combatiente a concentrarse a sus unidades correspondientes y mantenerse en alerta general quien no lo haga ser tomado como un desertor
8030928 por el trato que la mayor a de los medios impresos y electr nicos est n dando a nuestros comunicados existe la seguridad de que nuevamente la censura y la autocensura se aplique por comisi n omisi n o convicci n sin embargo por tica profesional no deber an detenerse en cumplir su importante labor de difundir nuestra postura ante los acontecimientos del pa s y mucho menos cuando est en juego la vida de dos luchadores sociales sin importar la forma de lucha de la cual son part cipes pero tambi n se ha contado con la solidaridad de gente honesta y con un alto valor civil para quienes se gu an en los marcos del periodismo mercantil preguntamos qu necesitamos hacer para ser considerados noticia o ser necesario que aparezcan los cuerpos de nuestros compa eros para que esto sea primicia
8030929 la presencia de los operativos militares desplegados en gran parte de nuestra rep blica no han servido para nada en la lucha contra la delincuencia organizada por el contrario se ha agudizado m s la disputa interna de los grupos de poder en los lugares donde ellos operan vinculados con los grupos del crimen organizado agradecemos la solidaridad desinteresada de todas aquellas organizaciones y personas nacionales e internacionales quienes a pesar de los riesgos y consecuencias que traigan estos pronunciamientos a favor de nuestros compa eros desaparecidos se han manifestado si el actual estado de derecho el estado de derecho olig rquico en lugar de castigar a los responsables de la represi n de las masacres de los cr menes de lesa humanidad proporciona a estos chacales protecci n e impunidad tengan por seguro que sin fecha y hora fija nuestro pueblo ejercer su leg timo derecho de hacerse justicia
8030930 resulta insultante para la inteligencia del pueblo que las autoridades estatales de oaxaca y federales pretendan eludir su responsabilidad en la detenci n desaparici n de nuestros compa eros con el c nico tr mite de
8030931 ante la actitud hip crita y fascista de este gobierno ileg timo de profundizar la guerra sucia y el terrorismo de estado como su principal pol tica contra los luchadores sociales los ponentes pol ticos y los revolucionarios ante la creciente escalada de represi n contra nuestro pueblo los luchadores sociales y activistas defensores de los derechos humanos ante la existencia de presos pol ticos y de conciencia del pa s condenados a penas y tratos inhumanos en c rceles de exterminio ante la pr ctica fascista de la desaparici n forzada de luchadores sociales ante la pretensi n del gobierno calderonista de mantener en calidad de detenidos desaparecidos a nuestros camaradas edmundo reyes amaya y gabriel alberto cruz s nchez

8030942 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8030943 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8030944 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8030945 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8030946 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8030947 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8030948 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8030949 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8030950 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8030951 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time

8030965 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8030966 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8030967 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8030968 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8030969 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8030970 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8030971 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8030972 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8030973 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8030974 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life

8030984 i denounce the laughable communications operation surrounding carla bruni sarkozy the staging of this meeting marks a serious slide into the hollywood ization of political life and an unfortunate mixing together of private and public spheres mme carla bruni sarkozy certainly has a beautiful voice but it isnt the voice of france above all it is intolerable to see ministers of state relegated to the background like bit players bernard kouchner and rama yade are not appearing in the dignity of their functions
8030985 french diplomacy emerges weakened from the deplorable way in which the chinese issue was managed by the government
8030986 several photos in our papers are showing for example rama yade carla bruni or bernard kouchner with their hands in prayer position like the dalai lama on the occasion of the inauguration of the largest buddhist temple in europe what would be the reaction of our papers if our ministers of state were to attend the inauguration of a cathedral make the sign of the cross and kneel during the consecration a simple question

8031000 incidents like this really reinforce the long held belief by non leftist that leftist have long since stopped caring about racism and instead just reflexively use it as a thoughtless bludgeon to attack anyone who disagree with them watching the clintons and their supporters being savaged as racist was darkly amusing as schadenfreude but given their track record as solid leftist it really just shows that few on the left actually care about real victims of racism if they did they wouldnt trivialize the accusation of racism in this manner years ago i use to stammer and make denials when someone called me a racist now i dont even blink ive come to accept the accusation as merely part of conversation with leftist

8031019 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have some more opportunities to win races and things like that
8031020 it seems like this year it has been the worst year out of the three so i guess you could say that probably factored in on things like that
8031021 i felt like ive done everything i can with the situation im in now
8031022 like i said it just seems like this last year it got a little bit worse as far as not being able to find some speed at some of these places
8031023 it seems like they are definitely on an uphill climb towards the top
8031024 they have definitely made progress its a team that i think will be here for a long time and seems to be heading in the right direction to win races

8031028 you know any type of breakup like that is not the easiest thing in the world to do for either side
8031029 but i feel like it went fairly well im not too sure how good those types of things can go but i think its ok
8031030 i think everybody kind of tried to pull together and tried to make sure that nobody was pointing fingers or anything like that
8031031 its obviously not a fun process to go through thats for sure having the extra pressure on you
8031032 but at the same time long term wise i feel like this is where i want to be

8031107 the big concern is that overexploitation is causing the fish to evolve the finding that humans can actually cause evolution of fish populations which in turn can drive their degradation is relatively new and is drawing a lot of attention
8031108 some fisheries including that for cod are now known to cause juvenescence or the evolution of younger smaller adult fish the ecological and economic consequences both appear to be negative
8031109 with cod populations at historic lows and challenges to rebuild them mounting it is important to explore the past for clues about characteristics such as stock sizes exploitation rates age and size structure etc and what ecological roles cod would have played when their populations were larger
8031110 over the past 10 years theres been a revolution of sorts in studying protein function in living systems using microscopy to follow dynamic movements and localizations of particular protein molecules
8031111 they give off multiple colors and whats particularly useful technologically is that it takes a longer time between when theyre excited with a light pulse and the time they fluoresce
8031112 one purpose of our studies is to demonstrate that we can detect lanthanide reporter tagged proteins at the single molecule limit in living cells
8031113 you add them to cell cultures and they go into cells find the protein you want to study and bind with high affinity its a straightforward way to selectively label a protein and makes it detectable

8031120 cant figure out what it all means and how it will shake out
8031121 can amazon own 100 of librarythings main competitor and manage its 40 stake in librarything without implicating itself in fiduciary responsibility conflict issues
8031122 can librarything continue to compete vigorously against shelfari when shelfari is owned by one of our investors
8031123 what can librarything do to protect itself against the possibility that amazon uses its enormous financial and technical resources to fund and promote shelfari
8031124 were excited to acquire shelfari and also pleased that when the abebooks deal closes well be a shareholder in librarything we think both companies are innovating in ways that are great for book lovers and were excited to have relationships with both
8031125 the acquisition of shelfari is completely separate from amazons acquisition of abebooks and abebooks stake in librarything
8031126 more importantly perhaps where amazon shelfari cant follow is in the values that make librarything different openness dynamism and independence

8031132 el esfuerzo de quienes a lo largo de los a os hicieron construir miles de kil metros de v as f rreas levantando centenares de estaciones ferroviarias a cuyo alrededor se formaron pueblos que hoy son ciudades los ferrocarriles luego de las privatizaciones fueron saqueados se hicieron desastres con la entrega de los ramales a la actividad privada y el peor de ellos fue suprimir el paso del tren por centenares de pueblos el mayor golpe que se les pudo dar a las econom as regionales por eso la reconstrucci n de los ferrocarriles no es un deseo hoy el barril de petr leo est entre 130 y 140 d lares y es casi seguro que el a o que viene llegar a los 200 como est n las cosas y ante la posibilidad de esos aumentos el transporte por rutas no se sabe si redituara o si dejar de ser negocio

8031136 this book is a must have for any woman who intends to pursue motherhood and academics
8031137 the writing in this book is alive often very humorous often fraught the quality of these narratives is uniformly excellent it s creative nonfiction at its best true stories that often read like fiction with compelling narratives and characters for whom much is at stake
8031138 this book gave me a great deal of encouragement because so many other women have decided to forgo teaching full time like i have and there was a continuing theme that it s okay if motherhood takes over the academic side of your life or if you decide to pursue your career but at the same time it s sad it s sad for our students and for our schools that so many women feel forced to choose between having a family and being an educator mama phd is a great read for anyone in academia considering motherhood any moms in academia looking for a better way and for all administration in schools everywhere actually maybe it should be required reading for administrators

8031206 im very excited to be the next democratic representative from the 4th congressional district markey told members of the national womens political caucus who met at baurs restaurant downtown
8031207 i am tired of the politics of the small of the petty of the insignificant and of the five second sound bite
8031208 sometimes youre going to have to defy the wishes of your party
8031209 they were just trying to score political points instead of trying to get the job done

8031213 maricor i just cant vote for a candidate who isnt pro life
8031214 the first thing i really noticed was at civic center park when i was in the food not bombs area
8031215 i was planning to march with the group that night
8031216 the group first gathered outside the city county building getting ready to march but the police blockaded us
8031217 we moved to the sidewalk a few people stayed in the street because we didnt want a confrontation but it didnt matter
8031218 people started pleading let me go i want to go home
8031219 we asked why we were being detained but they wouldnt talk to us they told us to sit down and we sat down
8031220 then they said that anyone with a photo i d could show it and be let out of the circle and anyone without i d would be arrested i saw a handful of people hold up their i d and police walked up to them grabbed them and took them out i dont know if they were arrested
8031221 they set up an arrest squad two police per protester and talked about who to pick get this one with the bandana or get that one in the black they were targeting individuals
8031222 the arrest process was the two officers picked you up searched you took your bag and everything except your money
8031223 then i was taken to another area loaded onto a bus that took us to a warehouse in a denver industrial park
8031224 they pumped in cold air in these big white tubes all night and all day the next day it was freezing in there i was lucky i had a jacket but other people were in shorts and t shirts we asked them to turn off the cold air but they didnt
8031225 eventually they put all of us in metal leg shackles and re handcuffed us in pairs with our right hands together right hand to right hand so it was difficult to move
8031226 they gave us sandwiches baloney or peanut butter and jelly and there was water in a big jug in each cage
8031227 we were utterly confused we did not understand why we were being detained we hadnt been read our miranda rights we didnt know what wed done to merit such a violent response or why the special operations police were needed
8031228 after they shackled us they put us in a van with no windows and took us to the courthouse where we were supposed to speak with a judge to hear the charges against us
8031229 the attorney explained we had three choices plead guilty and post a 300 bond 500 if you were from out of state or accept a plea bargain that dropped all the charges but one that you had to pay 141 for or plead not guilty and either post your own bail or wait in jail til your court date
8031230 then they walked us out of the courthouse and we saw another group from the protest walking in we were the first group to meet with a judge and a lawyer

8031260 biologists of all stripes acknowledge an amazing ability of various plants and animals to adapt to specialized niches for example scientists have recently discovered a new species wholly unrelated to any previously known species which survives on the lips of one particular type of lobster morris 1995 although this form of evolution is remarkable it also leaves the creatures vulnerable to even a slight change in the environment the same specialization that made these creatures so dependent on the success of a relatively small group of lobsters makes them less adaptable to relatively small changes in the global environment for example this particular group of lobsters may decline or migrate to a less desirable location threatening the existence of their tiny lip dwellers
8031261 the price of sawdust has soared since 2006 up from about 25 a ton to more than 100 in some markets blame the housing slump fewer new homes mean fewer trees cut for use in construction which leads to less sawdust and other wood waste driving up the price

8031290 wir hatten anweisung dass alles was mit sponsoring und beistellungen produktionskostenzusch sse von unternehmen d red zu tun hatte ber emigs tisch zu gehen hatte
8031291 ich musste mal ein interview mit ex radstar rudi altig im nordwestzentrum machen und fragte mich wieso da auch der regisseur beschwerte sich dass emig ihm schwenks auf sponsoren logos vorschrieb
8031292 wir waren trotzdem noch erfolgreich auch ohne smp und j rgen emig
8031293 du stellst das so dar als h tte ich dich nie unterst tzt
8031294 du hast ja auch verhindert dass ich zu olympia 92 konnte du hast die leute und auch mich schlicht und einfach benutzt
8031295 leider konnte ich beim 0 1 im finale gegen argentinien nicht spielen ich hatte hart daf r gearbeitet mich f rs spiel warm gemacht aber es ging nicht
8031296 vor allem beim 4 1 im halbfinale gegen belgien als ich zwei tore machte ein wichtiges spiel f r meine karriere ich hoffe dass ich im september auch zu den wm quali spielen geladen werde
8031297 zu hause ich will sie meinen eltern nach nigeria mitnehmen
8031298 eine tolle erfahrung ich traf ronaldinho messi diego und brasiliens trainer dunga die entscheidung zu fahren war richtig eine medaille kann man ja nicht einfach im gesch ft kaufen in nigeria sind die leute stolz auf uns
8031299 ich wei nicht wie der pr sident entscheidet f r gold h tte es ein haus in der hauptstadt und den titel member of nigeria gegeben was eine gro e ehre ist leider kann ich nicht beim empfang des pr sidenten sein weil ich direkt nach hoffenheim kam
8031300 klar ich habe fter mit spielleiter dirk rittm ller telefoniert und t glich auf die homepage geschaut toll die zwei siege die top ten sind diese saison drin
8031301 vedad ist ein guter junge ich freue mich f r ihn das w re umgekehrt genauso ich wei dass ich meinen platz zur ckerk mpfen muss und es keine privilegien gibt und ich werde k mpfen sobald das m glich ist ich hoffe bald
8031302 ich war perplex habe aber ganz schnell nein gesagt ich habe einen freund
8031303 ich hab ihm erst gesagt geh du pfeifen aber da der junge mann sehr freundlich war fragte ich ihn ob ich noch zu ende rauchen darf das war okay f r ihn und die sache damit erledigt normalerweise rauche ich ja eh nicht auf der bank
8031304 besonders in sozial schwachen bezirken gibt es eine regionale unterversorgung mit fach rzten ich mache mir gro e sorgen wie es in zukunft weitergehen soll
8031305 das sind die dummen sie haben kein geld und wohnen im falschen bezirk
8031306 nat rlich wollen auch rzte lieber in einem guten umfeld ihre praxis aufmachen au erdem gibt es in den reichen gegenden mehr privat versicherte patienten das ist wirtschaftlich nachvollziehbar
8031307 dass praxis rzte aus rein konomischen gr nden von sozial schwachen quartieren weg in finanziell betuchte viertel umziehen darf nicht so weitergehen
8031308 der sicherung der ambulanten versorgung der stadt nicht mehr nachzukommen
8031309 wir sehen seit jahren das problem dass es in bestimmten gegenden zu versorgungs engp ssen kommt doch die krankenkassen stellen leider zu wenig geld f r die ambulante versorgung ihrer versicherten zur verf gung da ist berlin bundesweit schlusslicht
8031310 wir erwarten dass die verlagerung von praxen in andere stadtbezirke mit der reform der rztlichen verg tung die im jahr 2009 wirksam wird gestoppt werden kann
8031311 den ball zu halten das ist nicht seine st rke
8031312 die nr 1 in der nationalmannschaft war immer mein ziel und bleibt es auch so lange ich die m glichkeit habe und mir die t r nicht zugemacht wird glaube ich daran
8031313 was sind das f r kriterien da d rfte die h lfte der leichtathleten nicht hin
8031314 wir m ssen erst einmal genau schauen was los war das machen wir wenn wir aus peking zur ck sind
8031315 oh ich hab solche sehnsucht ich will wieder an den strand ich will wieder an die nordsee ich will zur ck nach westerland
8031316 absolut es ist sch n die atmosph re im klub und bei den fans zu sp ren die spiele gegen bielefeld und schalke habe ich im internet verfolgt leider hat es nicht f r einen sieg gereicht
8031317 nein weil alles klar abgesprochen war es ist dabei vieles aufgebauscht worden aber ich bin werder sehr dankbar dass sie mir meinen traum olympia erm glicht haben
8031318 auch ohne gold ist mein fazit positiv die niederlage im halbfinale gegen argentinien tat weh doch wir wollten unbedingt eine medaille jetzt bin stolz dass wir es geschafft haben es war wunderbar den olympischen geist gesp rt zu haben diese ganz besondere atmosph re
8031319 ich bin k rperlich in einem sehr guten zustand 8 spiele in 26 tagen sind eine gute vorbereitung die erste nacht in bremen habe ich gut geschlafen dann gut trainiert ich bin bereit
8031320 mein klares ziel ist es deutscher meister zu werden ein anderes gibt es nicht bleiben wir von verletzungen verschont haben wir gute chancen es zu schaffen
8031321 jeder gute spieler ist bei werder willkommen claudio ist ein sehr guter st rmer einer der besten in deutschland er wird uns weiterhelfen
8031322 nein f r brasilien zu spielen ist eine gro e ehre sicher sind die reisen strapazi s ich h tte auch gerne einen anderen terminplan aufgestellt aber ich bin daf r nicht verantwortlich
8031323 unsere r ume sehen aus wie normale fitness studios sind aber speziell abgedichtet wir simulieren die h henluft durch eine zufuhr an stickstoff und weniger sauerstoff
8031324 echt anstrengend ich g hne die ganze zeit aber der gro e vorteil wenn ich ins echte h hentraining nach s lden gehe bin ich schon akklimatisiert und kann im schluss spurt vor dem kampf vollgas geben
8031325 ich stand sieben stunden im stau hierher jetzt bin ich fertig
8031326 ich habe sehr intensiven kontakt zu herrn lauder wir f hren gespr che ber eine leihgabe
8031327 in deutschland gibt es zwar kein gesetz das generell alkohol am arbeitsplatz verbietet allerdings muss man ein betriebliches alkoholverbot genauso beachten wie gesetzliche alkoholverbote f r bestimmte berufen wie busfahrer piloten etc auf jeden fall darf man aber auch ohne alkoholverbot nicht so viel trinken dass man seine arbeit nicht mehr ordnungsgem erledigen kann oder sogar andere gef hrdet
8031328 wenn die einnahme von alkohol im betrieb strikt verboten ist und ein alkoholkonsum nachgewiesen werden kann kann das eine k ndigung nach vorheriger abmahnung nach sich ziehen eine fristlose k ndigung allenfalls in wiederholungsf llen wenn die flasche dort als geschenkvorrat f r berraschende geburtstage von kollegen liegt und alkoholkonsum nicht nachweisbar ist kommt eine k ndigung aber nicht in betracht
8031329 ich fahre nur zu ausw rtsspielen wo ich sicher sein kann dass ich nicht gef hrdet bin
8031330 unsere fans sagen auch dass tradition auf jeden fall vorgeht wenn so eine zusammengekaufte truppe kommt dann hat das nat rlich einen faden beigeschmack die fanges nge geh ren einfach dazu
8031331 wir sollen nur ein auto f r das gesamte team bekommen sollen wir alle 20 tage den wagen weiterreichen
8031332 unser ersatztorwart christian schulte er stand nie auf dem spielbericht geh rt aber zu uns
8031333 der klub wollte einen mehr als gro z gigen preis nicht akzeptieren
8031334 ich bin nicht bereit die rechte f r eine deutschlandweite ausstrahlung f r 80 000 euro zu verkaufen
8031335 wir werden in jeder transfer periode um ihn k mpfen
8031336 bis auf gro e ank ndigungen war da bis jetzt nichts es gab keine taten des 1 fc k ln
8031337 in dem moment wo rummenigge so angreift zeigt er doch dass er in einer unsicheren position ist das hat er bei christoph daum schon mal versucht das ist d nnh utig
8031338 solange von den bayern kein signal kommt kann es doch keine taten von uns geben lukas hat einen vertrag und wir werden den jungen mit sicherheit nicht verr ckt machen
8031339 keiner will lukas jetzt aus m nchen wegholen und wir f hlen uns von den bayern auch nicht angegriffen
8031340 so wie ich es getan habe muss man ber einen spieler einfach reden d rfen
8031341 und deshalb glaube ich einfach daran dass wir ihn irgendwann hier wiedersehen
8031342 mit aguero und unseren fans im r cken werden wir keine probleme haben in die champions league einzuziehen
8031343 letzte saison waren wir im viertelfinale aguero w re nicht der erste super star den wir ausschalten
8031344 sie haben schon im hinspiel mit allen schmutzigen tricks gearbeitet nun wird es noch h rter doch wenn wir ein tor machen sind wir fast durch
8031345 es wird ein hei er abend aber wir haben auch in bremen bewiesen dass wir nur schwer zu schlagen sind
8031346 vorsichtig k nnen wir sagen dass junge frauen die in ihrem leben mehr als ein traumatisches erlebnis verarbeiten mussten automatisch zur risikogruppe f r brustkrebs gez hlt werden sollten und das m sste auch in den vorsorgeuntersuchungen ber cksichtigt werden
8031347 zuerst ignorieren sie dich dann lachen sie ber dich dann bek mpfen sie dich und dann gewinnst du
8031348 wir waren etwas zu sp t kamen erst um 21 20 uhr an da waren aber die anderen olympiasieger schon auf der b hne gewesen frodo hatte dann um 22 uhr noch einmal einen soloauftritt

8031351 sie verliebten sich er zog bei ihr ein die ehe lief gut dann kam ihre tochter zur welt ein absolutes wunschkind er war sehr ordentlich ging jeden tag zehn stunden arbeiten
8031352 nach dem spiel bei energie haben wir zwei wochen pause die wollen wir roman vorsichtshalber noch g nnen denn solch eine wunde platzt doch manchmal wieder auf
8031353 das staatsziel verpflichtet die politik besondere verantwortung f r das kulturelle leben in deutschland zu bernehmen kultur darf nicht einfach hintangestellt werden weil andere ausgaben stets wichtiger erscheinen
8031354 kultur als staatsziel ist eher ein kompass f r eine demokratische gemeinschaft der anzeigt welche ziele man f r vorrangig h lt das l sst sich aber nicht in geld ausdr cken das hat keine unmittelbaren auswirkungen auf den haushalt
8031355 die initiative ist reiner unsinn so berfl ssig wie ein kropf dadurch wird kein theater erhalten keine oper finanziert keine ausbildung im musischen bereich gef rdert so wird nur ein schlechtes gewissen beruhigt das wowereit gar nicht haben muss weil er schon eine menge f r die kultur tut
8031356 dann wird herr wowereit eventuell unterst tzer aus anderen bundesl ndern pr sentieren es soll einfach nicht zuungunsten der kultur gespart werden darum gehts
8031357 f r jeden automatisch sind n mlich weder der ehepartner noch die kinder zum kontozugriff berechtigt

8031362 alle sieger sind problemfilme schade dass diesmal keine wirklich guten kom dien eingereicht wurden
8031363 ich habe schon fter mit ihm zusammen im theater gearbeitet er ist sehr kritisch und das ist gut
8031364 fakharany wird das spiel nicht packen jaszka hat jetlag wir werden sehen ob er spielen kann
8031365 baba muss auf jeden fall in die halle kommen sich den fans zeigen da bleibe ich hart
8031366 ich habe von allen m glichen positionen auf die eisfl che geschaut und muss sagen man sieht von berall fantastisch so muss es ja auch sein
8031367 das eis ist noch ein wenig weich und die bande doch sehr hart aber wenn wir hier dann zwei drei mal trainiert haben gew hnen wir uns daran
8031368 das ist die beste halle die ich je gesehen habe
8031369 ich und der rest des teams sind verwundert dass simunic nicht gespielt hat
8031370 der trainer hat eine klare ansage gemacht dass es so nicht geht kritik muss intern besprochen werden das hat patrick auch eingesehen das war eine kurzschlussreaktion von ihm so etwas darf nicht mehr passieren
8031371 wahrscheinlich versteht nicht mal albert einstein warum ich nicht gespielt habe
8031372 ich verstehe dass es f r joe als 65 maligen nationalspieler nicht einfach ist auf der bank zu sitzen aber das kann und wird hier jedem passieren alle haben zu respektieren was der trainer sagt und entscheidet
8031373 no just tell him that you have a boyfriend and that you just dont see a friendship in your future
8031374 ich h rte einen lauten knall dann schlugen auch schon flammen aus dem motor
8031375 der ausbau stellt einen nicht akzeptablen eingriff in die einzigartige kulturlandschaft dar

8031385 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade

8031387 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8031388 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8031389 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8031390 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8031391 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8031392 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8031393 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8031394 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8031395 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8031396 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8031397 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8031398 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8031399 it should be fine now well just put some packing in and some stitches and youll be good to go

8031410 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8031411 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8031412 now i missed a few years of the cold war as a guest of one of our adversaries but as i recall the world was deeply divided during the cold war between the side of freedom and the side of tyranny
8031413 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8031414 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8031415 if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright

8031430 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as one of the most important text messages ever sent and one of the most successful brand engagements using mobile media

8031436 thinks that just because a guys an electrician or works for the gas company he will be a traditional democrat who will ignore culture issues but thats not true any longer
8031437 have a serious lifelong obligation to form their conscience in accord with human reason and the teaching of the church by studying sacred scripture and the teaching of the church as contained in the catechism of the catholic church
8031438 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8031439 as catholics we are not single issue voters yet a candidates position on a single issue that involves an intrinsic evil such as support for legal abortion or the promotion of racism may legitimately lead a voter to disqualify a candidate for receiving support
8031440 secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square frederick douglass abraham lincoln william jennings bryan dorothy day martin luther king indeed the majority of great reformers in american history were not only motivated by faith but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause to say that men and women should not inject their personal morality into public policy debates is a practical absurdity our law is by definition a codification of morality much of it grounded in the judeo christian tradition
8031441 fannie lou do you know did pap tell you what i said
8031442 if you dont go down and withdraw your registration you will have to leave
8031443 you still might have to go because we are not ready for that in mississippi
8031444 i didnt try to register for you i tried to register for myself
8031445 we are going to make you wish you was dead
8031446 its going to be in the same vein of mtvs the hills but ours is going to be more realistic
8031447 this club is an easy to swing distance machine and is a slam dunk to appeal to every player whos ever swung hard at a golf ball
8031448 there are no passengers on spaceship earth we are all crew
8031449 rossa core classics deliver an extremely soft pleasing feel especially with todays two piece balls
8031450 combine that with the proven effectiveness of agsi technology which negates backspin and promotes forwardspin for a smoother roll off the putterface and the pleasing head shapes and youve got four exceptional putters
8031451 imagine that a group of fans hops on the internet and starts emulating the characters in the show
8031452 through market research weve identified four types of players those who prefer classic blades classic mallets midsize mallets or oversize mallets
8031453 monza spider appeals to players who prefer oversize mallets the itsy bitsy monza spiders putterhead is 20 smaller which puts it in the midsize mallet category however we expect some crossover from classic mallet players and even classic blade players
8031454 a new letter has been sent to tom cruise business partner paula wagner and united artists
8031455 in which we set out the facts of the case again and put a figure on the legal demands of our clients of 11 million
8031456 since beginning the leave we have had no communication with sheriff dorion whatsoever
8031457 it has been 25 days since the leave expired and to the best of our knowledge sheriff dorion has not been in the county not been in the office not doing the duties for which he is required
8031458 since the creation of mankind until the advent of doomsday no fitnah damage will be greater than that of the dajjals anti christ
8031459 and yes i do feel the weight of the great masters on my shoulders
8031460 painters like giotto and michelangelo have painted the history of italy the story of the renaissance i am small by comparison
8031461 but i hope i can paint for pisa something they will cherish and remember and who knows in the future they might even be talking about my work
8031462 as the plaster dries the colours take on different shades the painting must begin immediately after the plaster is applied the painting must be exact and i must work fast
8031463 i have told some people to go away three or four times said the artist
8031464 ive tried various ways to tell them why they have not been chosen
8031465 i am looking for certain types of character in the casting sessions every face is studied carefully before the final selection is made
8031466 its a medieval nose perhaps it was also my stature
8031467 i will be painted in as part of the crowd that looks on as st ranierus performs one of his miracles
8031468 to be honest i dont really care where i am in the painting the fresco will be there for centuries to come and my face will be on that wall long after i have gone
8031469 with fresco painting like this there can be no mistakes
8031470 you put on your square of plaster you take a deep breath and you do it
8031471 and it doesnt matter if you are michelangelo or the badly paid assistant you just do it and you do it as quickly as you can
8031472 if you make a mistake the only way to change it is to take an axe and pull it off the wall this sort of painting sorts the men from the boys
8031473 but i take my hat off to him its wonderful that a young painter has the drive to do it and is prepared to take the risk
8031474 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
8031475 some publishers say a drop in spending on homes doesnt necessarily reflect declining interest in home improvement even if it has had a negative impact on advertising in some magazines there are many ways you can improve a house whether its 15 for a can of paint or 15 000 for a new bathtub said stephen drucker editor in chief of hearst corp s house beautiful which had a 19 increase in ad pages in its second quarter
8031476 to everyone who hesitates that decorating is a luxury at this unsettled moment id like to say that i think home is more important than ever not a last priority in your budget but a first now is the time to set a beautiful table and invite friends for dinner rather than go to a restaurant
8031477 the first thing you notice about the tour preferred iron when you position it behind the ball is the classically thin topline and that its shorter from heel to toe than the average iron you see today
8031478 what you dont see at address are the sole design and features in the cavity that help drive the performance of this club
8031479 our new tour preferred irons were developed for a wide range of players from middle handicappers to tour pros
8031480 thats how well they perform and thats how easy they are to hit weve worked hard the past few years to prove to golfers that were more than a metalwood company and these tour preferred irons are guaranteed to turn more players into believers
8031481 antes de los 16 a os era aficionado al deporte me gustaba mucho correr pero a os m s tarde mi sobrepeso me impidi seguir y entr en una intensa depresi n despu s me oper y ahora mi desaf o es lograr una buena marca en la 10k del domingo 31 de agosto
8031482 our new burner plus irons possess one of the highest moi measurements of any taylormade iron making them super forgiving and easy to hit
8031483 these are so easy to launch that its a blast to make a big swing and let them fly we had a lot of fun designing them and are looking forward to the reception they receive among golfers who like to go long
8031484 we took special care to address a common problem thats plagued many of our competitors combo sets and thats the distance gap formed between the lowest iron and the highest hybrid
8031485 for example if you average 170 yards with your 5 iron and 190 yards with your 4 hybrid youve got a 20 yard gap between those clubs and thats a problem we avoided that issue by carefully configuring the two rescues in the burner plus combo set to deliver a distance increase thats consistent with the distance increase delivered from iron to iron from the lob wedge all the way up to the 5 iron thus if a players distance difference between each iron is 10 yards he can be confident that his rescue 4 will be 10 yards longer than his 5 iron and that his rescue 3 will be 10 yards longer than his rescue 4
8031486 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
8031487 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
8031488 we are eons from trust me in terms of msnbc ever mirroring or adopting the fox news blueprint for news and blueprint for propaganda frankly
8031489 una persona mi ha detto che non mi aveva mai visto piangere
8031490 spot us is using its website to solicit ideas for investigative articles and the money to pay for the reporting but the experiment has also raised concerns of journalism being bought by the highest bidder
8031491 spot us wont be ready until the fall but weve received lots of interest so weve launched a wiki to capture ideas and test the concept of community funded reporting in northern californias bay area
8031492 thats why the obama biden ticket to me is the real future for america
8031493 lo que podemos decir es que estamos absolutamente confiados en que no existe ninguna amenaza cre ble contra la vida del candidato la convenci n dem crata o los habitantes de colorado
8031494 iban a matar a obama desde un punto elevado utilizando un rifle
8031495 the housing market has dried up and thats trickled down and affected nearly every business sector the restaurants dont have customers and the retailers dont have business
8031496 they are in such bad straights they are coming to us to keep them from filing for bankruptcy they are on the verge of going out of business
8031497 when youre an entrepreneur sometimes you take chances i took a chance it didnt work out now i need to refocus and start the next chapter of my life
8031498 for a long time there was an artificial inflation of real estate consumers were able to instead of filing for bankruptcy get a second mortgage and use that cash to pay off credit cards
8031499 now that artificial inflation is gone and the value in homes is not there

8031517 tengo una cifra mas o menos de 208 que se desmovilizaron siendo mayores de edad pero llegaron siendo menores de edad
8031518 para m ha sido muy importante e impactante la verdad es que no hab a tenido ocasi n de ver una fosa en la que se est descubriendo cad veres y ver los cuerpos y sus restos cr neos dentaduras miembros del cuerpo humano es muy impactante
8031519 este tipo de acciones que est n desarrollando los fiscales demuestra que la aplicaci n de la ley de justicia y paz es fundamental para que los familiares de las v ctimas tengan un punto de referencia y sepan d nde est el ser querido
8031520 un antes y un despu s de que se han encontrado los restos
8031521 la desaparici n forzada de personas es el peor crimen que puede existir porque conlleva no s lo la tortura f sica en su momento sino tambi n la tortura sicol gica durante los a os que perdura esa desaparici n por lo tanto me voy muy impresionado y firmemente convencido de que es necesario apoyar todo el proceso
8031522 it is time for our students to start moving from excellence and competence to competitiveness weve got to start getting students ready for the 21st century
8031523 if we can get 9th graders in class i can assure they will have engaging classes
8031524 we need to put our strongest teachers with our strongest needs
8031525 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point ceasefire agreement
8031526 in accordance with united nations security council resolutions that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognised borders of georgia and they must remain so
8031527 and therefore in accordance with other security council resolutions that are still in force abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognised borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8031528 todays announcement by president medvedev that russia will recognise south ossetia and abkhazia is unjustifiable and unacceptable
8031529 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine tomorrow to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8031530 this contradicts principles of territorial integrity as a fundamental right
8031531 it calls for a political solution to the conflicts in georgia it will examine the consequences of russias decision from this point of view
8031532 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8031533 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8031534 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8031535 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8031536 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8031537 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8031538 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8031539 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8031540 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8031541 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8031542 ive got a great home at fox now and i think its where i belong i wish i couldve had different news for giants fans but ive known for a while im done
8031543 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8031544 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8031545 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8031546 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8031547 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8031548 the board believes the formation of this committee is an important first step in keeping judicial elections fair and nonpartisan
8031549 we do not foresee anything happening with the candidates and hope the committee has very little work to do this fall
8031550 we believe endwar will revolutionize the strategy genre on consoles and are thrilled gamers will be able to get a little taste of why we are so excited about endwars release this holiday season
8031551 with its innovative voice command and intuitive game design fans will be able to learn first hand how a console game was able to win the judges over and win best strategy game of e3 for the first time in a category previously dominated by pc titles
8031552 he brings experience theres about 30 years of generally being wrong on foreign policy issues and i dont think thats going to help the obama ticket
8031553 the nation is thirsting for someone who puts country above party thats another reason why i know mr obama is not ready to lead
8031554 is a charming fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8031555 his experience does not provide for him the gravitas necessary to face the challenges of the world
8031556 the clips they have of biden were clips that said obama was not ready to be president those are different than our clips
8031557 you are not going to find anyone on our stage that said mccain was not ready to be president
8031558 i said time and time again that i respected mccain as a candidate and that there was no question in my mind he would make a good president
8031559 im still absolutely adamant this is a problem system administrators should have handled a long time ago
8031560 its a really big issue if they havent figured it out someone will do it for them

8031567 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8031568 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8031569 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8031570 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8031571 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8031572 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8031573 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8031574 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8031575 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8031576 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8031577 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8031578 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8031579 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8031580 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8031581 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8031582 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8031583 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8031584 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8031585 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8031586 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8031587 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8031588 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8031589 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8031590 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8031591 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8031592 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8031593 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8031594 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8031595 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8031596 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8031597 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8031598 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8031599 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8031600 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8031601 historians are just salivating to get their hands on this stuff
8031602 this will complete the historical record about the espionage activities of the rosenberg spy ring
8031603 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8031604 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8031605 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8031606 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8031607 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8031608 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8031609 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8031610 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8031611 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8031612 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8031613 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8031614 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8031615 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8031616 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8031617 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8031618 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8031619 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8031620 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8031621 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8031622 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8031623 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8031624 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8031625 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
8031626 moscows action deserves condemnation from the entire international community and russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8031627 todays decision the culmination of a long effort aimed at splitting these two regions away from georgia represents a major step forward in that process
8031628 the u s should lead within the u n and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions
8031629 if russias government continues to violate the norms and practices of the international community the united states and our allies must review all aspects of relations with russia
8031630 let me be clear weve conducted an intensive investigation chased down numerous leads and carefully reviewed the evidence to date
8031631 it is a very serious federal crime to threaten a presidential candidate in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama
8031632 reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time and they cannot independently corroborated
8031633 the evidence involving alleged threats does not warrant federal charges but the investigation is ongoing and we are keeping an open mind
8031634 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8031635 the sergeant discovered inside his truck a bullet proof vest two rifles ammunition walkie talkies and drugs
8031636 additional information was then developed which led to the arrest of others
8031637 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8031638 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8031639 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8031640 this is a fabrication by the sudanese government and some criminals
8031641 we denounce and condemn this act we want the protection of civilians wherever they are this is a dirty conspiracy to defame
8031642 while we are extremely pleased with the results obtained from the work undertaken to date on our three marketed and seven pipeline drugs four of which are moving towards commercial release we feel this success is not yet represented in shareholder value
8031643 we have invested heavily in the respective successful development of our products now we need assistance in developing our companys share valuation
8031644 collectively these developments have substantially increased the value of sinobiomed which has seen a dramatic corresponding increase in market capitalization of nearly 200
8031645 we have therefore retained cb capital partners as our financial advisor to assist in reviewing our strategic alternatives with the objective of maximizing shareholder value and we look forward to working with them to ensure that all alternatives available to the company are considered and evaluated to achieve that objective
8031646 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8031647 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8031648 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8031649 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8031650 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8031651 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8031652 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8031653 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8031654 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8031655 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8031656 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8031657 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8031658 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8031659 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8031660 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8031661 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8031662 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was

8031664 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8031665 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8031666 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8031667 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle we have an obligation to our employees and to our shareholders to defend ourselves against competitors who engage in unfair business practices against us
8031668 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8031669 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8031670 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8031671 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8031672 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8031673 i wore pajamas the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8031674 what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
8031675 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
8031676 if you look at the numbers theres bad news in the story
8031677 and even into poverty where they are caught by the public healthcare program safety net
8031678 it doesnt capture what it costs to meet some of a familys basic necessities
8031679 even using those low standards more families especially with children are sliding into poverty and becoming eligible for public programs
8031680 it still assumes that american families spend about one third of their budget on food but whats really punishing american families are housing and energy costs
8031681 by every measure 2008 is going to be worse clearly there are going to be increasing problems growth in poverty and higher unemployment especially among unskilled workers
8031682 want to hear what their political leaders are going to do to reduce it
8031683 as more americans struggle to make ends meet we have seen a growing willingness among political leaders from both parties to talk about how to come up with concrete and workable solutions
8031684 is a glowing tribute to all of the parties involved including the regulatory bodies as well as the faculty and new leadership team
8031685 we are grateful for the hard work and cooperation of all of the important myers university stakeholders including the dedicated faculty administrators and overseers for an institution of higher learning in a mere 90 days to progress from nearly closing to a complete change of ownership is i believe unprecedented it would not have happened without truly dedicated and talented people
8031686 since may 20 2008 when the investor group first became involved with the university the existing myers university has been reorganized to enhance productivity with the implementation of efficient and effective processes
8031687 we are very pleased that myers faculty and staff have welcomed us with open arms and have taken an active role in moving the university forward
8031688 without the support of the faculty and staff we would not have gotten this far in this short amount of time myers has some truly awesome employees who are dedicated to the students
8031689 my colleagues and i are confident that under the guidance of dr scott as provost myers will reclaim its rightful place as a pioneer in the post secondary education arena in northeastern ohio and beyond
8031690 now myers can continue to provide students with superior degrees that will make them highly sought after for meaningful job placement in cleveland
8031691 we are thankful for the confidence current and returning students have with the new leadership we have seen many students who have been away from myers return when they heard about and met the new leadership meeting with students addressing their concerns and assisting them with their issues has been my priority
8031692 we are seeking partnerships in cleveland with groups like the cleveland clinic the fbi rock and roll hall of fame high school districts and others to help offer custom degrees for the career placement
8031693 we are eager to help students realize their dreams by obtaining a quality education we are willing to explore every option to provide needed assistance to students and to the companies that reimburse tuition
8031694 within a very short period of time significant initiatives have been taken to ensure not only that current students will be able to finish their programs but also to establish a long term strategic plan to secure the stability and effectiveness of myers university with the highest moral academic and business integrity
8031695 starting today youll be able to totally modify your css and use custom cnames
8031696 now your reddit can be restyled to look however you want like any wordpress blog
8031697 since i was about 18 or 19 theyve been my favorite band

8031699 weve been friends and ive jammed with them plenty those guys were inspiring to me
8031700 will the vote be cut short so as not to prolong the image of a party divided between obama and clinton
8031701 r as the denver post reported is there a chance it will take place outside public view at a hotel breakfast meeting on wednesday which wont exactly sit well with clinton backers
8031702 be sure and register repuglican michelle pumas who vote for mccain arent democrats
8031703 the children were not at risk they were on the second floor of the home and asleep at the time of incident
8031704 survivors prepare themselves both mentally and emotionally to do what it takes it might involve life threatening risk you may do something you never thought you were capable of doing
8031705 there are two extremes on the one hand is paranoia and on the other is oblivion
8031706 were just trying to get people to keep this on their radar
8031707 but we cant say its never going to happen again its when is it going to happen and we have to be prepared to survive that
8031708 you more or less are giving them a blueprint for how to avoid law enforcement
8031709 i do think its important that we talk to our folks and give them some guidance on how to protect themselves and others
8031710 its not something that 10 years ago we thought wed be talking about but unfortunately its something we need to do now
8031711 theyre simply inputting flight plans manually which takes more time than an electronic transfer
8031712 the epicentre of the whole listeriosis thing is in ontario the most cases the most deaths the plant is here
8031713 part of the job of leadership too is to reassure people who are worried theyre confused and mr mcguintys been nowhere to be seen nor have his ministers because theyve all just decided theyre going to duck and stay on holidays rather than face up to their responsibilities
8031714 i think its really unfortunate that mr tory would want to engage in this kind of political gamesmanship
8031715 the fact of the matter is that ive been in constant contact with the chief medical officer and officials to make sure that we are monitoring and that we are importantly engaging with our federal partners who have a responsibility because this is a cross canada issue
8031716 put in place the supports the protocols and the practices that protect ontarians
8031717 no one can ever guarantee that an outbreak would never take place
8031718 but i can tell you that ontarians are protected by a network of dedicated public health officials and they did their jobs
8031719 there has been enough hardship upon enough ontario families as it is
8031720 its part of their belief system that this is not the right thing to do
8031721 this outbreak at least got going because it took hold in an unimmunized community so they are the ones who are really sitting ducks for infection
8031722 weve tried to do advertising to the general public about the importance of not sharing spit because thats how this thing has spread
8031723 they put me in padded undergarments so i might be warm in winter and then they slipped my limbs into the silk gowns and satin tunics that had been made for my dowry for my outer layer i wore a padded silk jacket with sleeves embroidered in an elaborate and very colourful kingfisher pattern mama placed a sliver of jade in my mouth to safeguard my body second aunt tucked coins and rice in my pockets so i might sooth the rabid dogs id meet on the way to the after world third aunt covered my face with a thin piece of white silk fourth aunt tied coloured string around my waist to prevent me from carrying away any of our familys children and around my feet to restrain my body from leaping about should i be tormented by evil spirits on my journey
8031724 our society is run by insane people for insane objectives i think were being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and i think im liable to be put away as insane for expressing that thats whats insane about it
8031725 those 80 85 who did not fire did not run or hide in many cases they were willing to risk great danger to rescue comrades get ammunition or run messages but they simply would not fire their weapons at the enemy even when faced with repeated waves of banzai charges
8031726 if the people knew what we had done they would chase us down the street and lynch us
8031727 were real comfortable that its not going to come down and threaten homes again
8031728 i come in and think like a criminal what looks attractive to me
8031729 youre leaving your purse or your laptop or your i pod or whatever it is they are going to want that and they are going to be in your car and gone in a matter of minutes
8031730 i have access to personal information right here i mean im a good guy but if im a bad guy ive got access to motor vehicle information
8031731 you could have your registration in there one thing is you could have your garage door opener in there it wouldnt be hard to find your house i got your address and your remote
8031732 i wouldnt be surprised if later today we got a call on this vehicle that says it was either stolen or ransacked or damaged in some way
8031733 we take a proactive approach we spend a lot of time a lot of manpower combating this issue but we cant do it alone its going to take everybodys part that includes the riding public
8031734 at this point we can say it was not an arson fire we do not believe the person started it on purpose
8031735 this will become a criminal matter so law enforcement keeps it pretty close to the vest
8031736 i just saw big old smoke and stood on the porch here and watched it burst into flames the wind was blowing so hard they couldnt keep track of it white said
8031737 i have no clue i dont know people go and run up there and stuff but i didnt see anybody up there
8031738 we look for anything from sparks from machinery over head power lines abandoned campfires shooting
8031739 but once the investigation is finished then we will we will make it public
8031740 sometimes when people see smoke they will get their cameras out and maybe take photos of it
8031741 that would be very helpful if we could get copies of those photos
8031742 not been read enough age appropriate stories but that would lay the blame at my feet
8031743 four us helicopter engines worth 13 million 7 million went missing on the way from kabul to pakistan in april
8031744 moscow has reminded nato of the importance of russian goodwill to secure the supply lines of the us nato operation in afghanistan through central asia alternatively nato can become wholly dependent on routes through pakistan from where i am sitting that does not look like a very good move and where i am sitting at this moment is a hotel room in peshawar pakistan by siding fully with iran russia has the capability to wreck any possibility of compromise between tehran and the west and to push the us towards an attack that would be disastrous for western interests and enormously helpful to russias

8031764 we specialize in getting the abuser away from the dog we truly work with the abuser we go to a house if its really cold out we see two dogs in the back we build them a doghouse
8031765 its a big extreme between homicide and a stolen dog

8031775 sales improved significantly in july 2008 and remained above the 400 000 level for the third consecutive month
8031776 deeply discounted distressed sales continue to drive volume in many regions of the state july also was the first full month during which the effects of higher 729 000 conforming loan limits likely had an impact on closed sales
8031777 year to year increases in the number of transactions ranged from a 6 7 percent increase in the san francisco bay area to a 176 5 percent increase in the riverside san bernardino region
8031778 in general greater percentage gains occurred in lower priced areas that had been most adversely affected by the market downturn since late 2005 and that are concurrently experiencing the biggest declines in prices
8031779 once again the 40 3 percent year to year decrease in the median price of a home was an all time record surpassing the previous record set in june with a 37 9 percent decrease
8031780 since the statewide median remained in the 585 000 595 000 range through august of last year the market will continue to experience significant year to year adjustments through august even if the median price holds steady over the next few months
8031781 the statewide median was last in the 350 000 range in early 2003
8031782 more banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen

8031786 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death
8031787 your enemy is not surrounding your country your enemy is ruling your country
8031788 mossad provoked americas air strike on libya in 1986 by making it appear that terrorist orders were being transmitted from the libyan government to its embassies
8031789 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8031790 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8031791 you see they say that people shrivel up because they have an imagination so dont imagine anything youll become brave as hell
8031792 well we need this and we need that and this is the way it should be and shame on mccain for what ever the hell he did

8031804 good job microsoft for trying to protect 75 of the worlds internet users
8031805 it has the potential to undermine the economies of the internet said mike zaneis vice president of the interactive advertising bureau
8031806 google looks as if its on top of the world right now holding an ever increasing lions share of the search market the way it treats its employees writes preston gralla another example google employees such as sergey solyanik have started deserting the company and its share price is down double that of the dow or nasdaq since november 2007 even if google has lost its mojo why should you care it wont make your searches any less effective will it nope but google has its eyes on bigger things than search notably your it department its looking to displace microsoft with hosted services like google apps gmail and google docs solyanik warns that googles engineers care more about the coolness of a service than about the services effectiveness
8031807 no sympathy for the parents and that he was tired of googlers who felt entitled to perks like bottled water and m amp ms then it sounds like something is indeed turning sour at google it seems like every hot company that skyrockets eventually has to come back to earth
8031808 but just think by working here you get to change the world

8031814 just because im hurting that dont mean that youve done something wrong
8031815 we fixed it we thought just by leaving but the heart is too wise for deceiving its calling for you
8031816 ive got no time to look back ive got no time to see the pieces of my heart that have been ripped away from me and if the feeling starts to coming ive learned to stop it fast theres bills to pay and songs to play and a house to make a home i guess im older now and ive got no time to cry
8031817 im sleeping later and waking later im eating less and thinking more and how am i without you am i more myself or less myself i feel younger louder like i dont always connect

8031826 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
8031827 moscows action deserves condemnation from the entire international community and russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8031828 todays decision the culmination of a long effort aimed at splitting these two regions away from georgia represents a major step forward in that process
8031829 the u s should lead within the u n and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions
8031830 if russias government continues to violate the norms and practices of the international community the united states and our allies must review all aspects of relations with russia
8031831 we repeatedly called for returning to the negotiating table and did not deviate from this position of ours even after the unilateral proclamation of kosovos independence
8031832 however our persistent proposals to the georgian side to conclude agreements with abkhazia and south ossetia on the non use of force remained unanswered regrettably they were ignored also by nato and even at the united nations
8031833 its time for individuals to begin to demand that we make a change he said but what those changes were he didnt say
8031834 im here to make it fun he told us before the event started
8031835 i hope funding for schools is a big priority for obama she then told us alan cumming spoke to us about the importance of sex ed while posing for the cameras and smiling as the photographers cooed sugary compliments at him
8031836 the only form of sex ed that the government funds is abstinence he said
8031837 its a really scary time when young people are becoming sexually active and dont have the education to look after themselves
8031838 celebration of african american leaders reception we turned to one of the camera women who had originally been scowling at us
8031839 we get locked into always thinking its liberal versus conservative thats not true
8031840 in fact most americans are centrist and an increasing number are independent and theres no question those are the swing votes
8031841 as the democrats try to realign this map and put states like colorado into play its independent voters theyre reaching out to
8031842 colorado is one of six states across the country where independent voters actually outnumber democrats or republicans
8031843 this post partisan message has been the key to his rise and hes got to rediscover that going into the fall thats how you win elections
8031844 in many cases delinquent oil bills dont get posted to the large credit reporting agencies
8031845 given the current situation of the industry where bills are large and consumers are getting shut off they tend to jump from one company to another
8031846 were not a credit reporting agency we dont tell you to take them on or not to take them on its up to you to assess the risk
8031847 it looks like were slowly starting to dig out of this
8031848 sabi niya kunin ko yung sasakyan sa batangas city wala pang fifteen minutes itinawag sa kin napatay na raw siya

8031853 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
8031854 these suicides are linked to the isolation and the difficult working conditions these workers face in lebanon
8031855 many domestic workers are literally being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement
8031856 suggest that forced confinement excessive work demands employer abuse and financial pressures are key factors pushing these women to kill themselves or risk their lives
8031857 the right to move freely to work in decent conditions to communicate with their friends and families and to earn a living wage
8031858 the high death toll of migrant domestic workers in lebanon from unnatural causes shows the urgent need to improve their working conditions
8031859 police have surrounded government house and have taken up their positions they are not going to disperse the crowd we are trying to negotiate
8031860 police needed to reshuffle so that the officers who were on duty since yesterday tuesday can take a rest i still insist that as of now police will not use force to disperse protesters
8031861 this is the time that the authorities will storm into the government house
8031862 they know they cannot let protesters stay because we will make trouble for the government there are a lot of people who want to join us but have been blocked by the police
8031863 they the pad want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again

8031868 republicans have accused democrats of inventing the temper line of attack to knock the arizona senator
8031869 i do get good and angry really angry by god im not going to let them beat me again i dont like to lose
8031870 hatch who serves with mccain in the senate said his colleague is a passionate person and he does have a temper and sometimes its awful to be on the wrong side of it
8031871 i decided i didnt want this guy anywhere near a trigger
8031872 ire is all too real this has prompted questions about whether his temperament is suited to the office of commander in chief i decided i didnt want this guy anywhere near a trigger domenici told newsweek in 2000
8031873 only an a would put together a budget like this
8031874 anybody who knows john mccain knows that he gets angry
8031875 william bennett the former education secretary the prominent conservative who came very close to endorsing you a few days ago called some of your comments irresponsible and intemperate
8031876 you portray those with whom you disagree as not just wrong but wicked
8031877 family founder james dobson talk to tens of millions of people each day mccains tone was certainly on dobsons mind when he issued a stinging anti endorsement on super tuesday he mentioned various issues but dobson also said the senator
8031878 it was election night 1986 and john mccain had just been elected to the u s senate for the first time even so he was not in a good mood mccain was yelling at the top of his lungs and poking the chest of a young republican volunteer who had set up a lectern that was too tall for the 5 foot 9 politician to be seen to advantage according to a witness to the outburst
8031879 youd have to stick cotton in your ears not to hear it he mccain was screaming at him and he was red in the face it wasnt right and i was very upset at him
8031880 if i heard that word gigahertz one more time i was going to scream says king 48 who left force computers in 2003
8031881 how can i bring my love of music and my skills and love of electronics and bring those two things together a light bulb went off
8031882 apple computer has been successfully convincing the youth of the world that their little things are high
8031883 jagged alliance provides an exciting blend of rpg and turn based action which has already won fans and accolades worldwide
8031884 its the right time to bring the frenetic battles to nintendo ds and offer a new generation of players an exhilarating game play experience
8031885 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8031886 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8031887 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8031888 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8031889 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8031890 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8031891 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8031892 a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization
8031893 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8031894 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8031895 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8031896 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
8031897 i was listening to michelle obamas speech and she commented that senator biden hasnt forgotten where he came from maybe he and all those who support abortion have forgotten where we came from the womb
8031898 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the
8031899 what the speaker had to say was utterly incredible in this day and age
8031900 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8031901 like many other citizens of this nation i was shocked to learn that the speaker of the house of representatives of the united states of america would make the kind of statements that were made to mr tom brokaw of nbc tv on sunday august 24 2008
8031902 what the speaker had to say about theologians and their positions regarding abortion was not only misinformed it was also and especially utterly incredible in this day and age
8031903 marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8031904 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons they are not parts of their mothers and what they are depends not at all upon the opinions of theologians of any faith
8031905 anyone who dares to defend that they may be legitimately killed because another human being chooses to do so or for any other equally ridiculous reason should not be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
8031906 nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8031907 the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8031908 the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8031909 given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8031910 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8031911 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8031912 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8031913 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8031914 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8031915 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
8031916 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do
8031917 that is why i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
8031918 i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
8031919 will your speech address the life issue which is what many in the party identify you with
8031920 does your inclusion on tonights speakers lineup send a message that the democratic party has changed on abortion the fact that im speaking is really a testament to senator obamas willingness to reach out to people who disagree with him even on important issues its emblematic of his ability to put coalitions together on an issue and to bring all sides together hes not just talking about that but acting will your speech address the life issue which is what many in the party identify you with yes it will but its mostly a night and an opportunity when weve been invited to focus on the economy and frankly what a lot of folks are struggling with in pennsylvania but certainly not only that theres been a lot of discussion about 92 but there is an obvious disagreement i have with senator obama and we want to make sure that people understand that difference of opinion one of the things thats missing in this important debate in american politics is candid and honest talk about disagreements and an honest effort to try to find common ground its much easier to say you dont agree with someone and to continue fighting and discontinue the dialogue its much harder but its important to be honest and show respect for others that we disagree but to actually work to bring the sides together one way to do that and neither party has done enough on this is to be very supportive of pregnant women and the pregnant women support act is the only vehicle and the best vehicle to do that its a challenge to the left and a challenge to the right and helps not only bring the sides together but provides affirmative options for women when a woman becomes pregnant for most women thats a time of happiness and joy and they look forward to bearing a child but to some its a crisis because they dont have the economic wherewithal and the support they need and a lot of women feel all alone and we dont do enough to show solidarity with them as pope john paul ii said we should show radically solidarity with the woman facing these challenges this piece of legislation is the one vehicle in american government for bringing the sides together and for providing women with options but is senator obama supporting it hes spoken about it i have gotten to know him on the campaign trail and he spoke about the concept when he was at rick warrens church so i believe he will be supportive we have not talked directly about the bill but its something i will be discussing with people in both parties its going to take a lot of work
8031921 we want to make sure that people understand that difference of opinion
8031922 i find the traditional design studio approach where you only discuss a project in house with whoever happens to work there and then claim to have come up with the best possible solution somewhat arrogant
8031923 big gnarly issues of our day like global warming and poverty
8031924 we want to take these young enthusiastic designers and seasoned advisors and mash them together to come up with solutions that no one single entity would have been able to do
8031925 la la la la lala la la la la lalala la la la
8031926 the htc s740 combines a powerful premium phone with a full slide out keypad in a compact and sleek form factor
8031927 proponents say the lease approach could provide financial relief to state governments struggling with foreclosures ballooning pension obligations and reduced tax bases thats not to mention crumbling roads and lately a drop in tax revenue to pay for repairs owing to high gasoline prices that have reduced driving the u s needs about 1 6 trillion in investment over the next several years to bring infrastructure conditions to acceptable levels according to the american society of civil engineers
8031928 detractors from the turnpike commission itself to labor unions question whether the state is selling too cheaply they also worry that jobs will be lost under the proposal union contracts are guaranteed only until 2011 and that tolls will rise the new operators can raise tolls 25 in 2009 then keep them in line with inflation every year
8031929 more broadly in a country that has often mythologized the car and the open road the deal is sparking debate about whether americas highways are too much a part of the national fabric to be controlled by anyone but the public adding to the backlash many of these private funds come from outside the u s where investors have reaped huge profits from rising oil and commodities prices and are looking for new places to put their money the consortium vying to lease the pennsylvania turnpike includes citigroup inc and abertis a spanish toll road operator
8031930 its still summer children would be much better off spending the last week of august either on vacation or with their families at home
8031931 its way too early for kids to be going back to school it makes no sense to hold classes for a few days this week only to send everyone back home for the three day labor day weekend
8031932 as senate chairman of the education committee for the past 12 years ive looked at this issue long enough to know its the right thing to do
8031933 state guidelines regarding the length of the school year have been blurred over time to allow for the mandatory 180 school days interrupted by everything from professional development days to the threat of snow
8031934 now is the time for connecticut to step up and address this issue

8031938 there is insufficient evidence that there was any kind of a plot or a threat but well keep an open mind as we look
8031939 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8031940 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8031941 are pretty convincing that were going to see increases in poverty as a result of food and fuel prices
8031942 so from going to dallas to san antonio staying one hour and turning right around and going to dc then some other items in his baggage that we cant go into all of those red flags is why law enforcement wanted to have a long conversation with him
8031943 if the bell curve is a fact then so is the reality that most doctors are going to be average there is no shame in being one of them right

8031962 the other night at the media party the mayor and the governor both talked about how wonderful the ute dancers were
8031963 and then they immediately started making a speech about how the west was won i think i was one of the only people there to write about how ironic that was
8031964 the liberation of iraq and several other recent american military actions in a speech to veterans here tuesday in which he accused senator barack obama of being confused about americas global role as a
8031965 just days after the russian invasion of georgia senator obama had this to say about the crisis mr
8031966 quote weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point end of quote
8031967 i guess we are left to figure out the rest for ourselves mr
8031968 its unlikely he was alluding to afghanistan the nation we liberated after 9 11 and continue to help despite russian complaints about our related deployments in central asia
8031969 if i catch senator obamas drift then our failure to lead by example was the liberation of iraq mr
8031970 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8031971 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression mr
8031972 to promote stability and peace america must stand firmly on the side of freedom and justice the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8031973 my opponent had the chance to express such confidence in america when he delivered a much anticipated address in berlin he said
8031974 he was the picture of confidence but in some ways confidence in self and confidence in ones country are not the same
8031975 the confusion here is between john mccain rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on senator obama said hari sevugan an obama campaign spokesman
8031976 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world in contrast barack obama has called for strong american leadership and renewing strong alliances to finish the fight against al qaeda and press russia to live up to its obligations
8031977 and in that speech senator obama left an important point unclear he said
8031978 he suggested that the end of the cold war proved that there was quote no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
8031979 invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8031980 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome john mccain
8031981 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8031982 you want to talk about mistakes lying to the american people is a mistake misleading our allies and the un is a mistake covering up incompetence is a mistake not admitting when youre wrong is a mistake and voting for four more years of the same is a mistake
8031983 i dont know whether his suruma personal assistant took minutes i have to check with her
8031984 if the minister had any objection he would have called for clarification
8031985 confirm that the minister approved the funds plans involving billions of money basing on a two page document
8031986 we had a budget for land investment but not a budget for the land in question
8031987 your submission is as if suruma is incapable how can you say the minister operates in such a manner you are an independent institution and should take responsibility
8031988 the boards advice to arma to transfer their land into amos nzeeyis name to avoid conflict of interest
8031989 we advised the transfer because mbabazi works for government and the fund is under government supervision
8031990 the potential conflict of interest was for a government minister to deal negotiate directly with the nssf which is a government controlled entity in respect of a transaction in which that government minister had a personal interest
8031991 the board has not yet considered this investment although the management is investigating the viability of doing so

8032088 should i laugh or not is this a funny hindi movie dialogue or is this a reference to some cricket players anatomy he is sure about the fact that the game can be played with ones legs apart from that he is pretty much the girl who heard about world cup and came on to support brazil incarnation then everyday at 11 45 football lovers make sure they switch off the tv they do not change channels and wait for the match to start duniya goal hai with a pun that ranks right up there with are yu relax singh and is this ranchi has two hosts named ranvir and ajay they can talk so that accounts for one of their senses the rest i am not sure of the lean guy sometimes understands that in silence lies their honour but the fat guy has a whole new concept of humour hope the producers didnt have laurel and hardy in mind when they chose these two to think on those lines i doubt if they had something called the mind at all they also have this rat race where they let a rat in a box the rat through its athletic prowess predicts the winner of the match i could compare this with the tarot reader of set max which complete my description about the rat race i hope this is an improptu act if not i hope not to see the day when they do one indianizing involves making it another unbearable bollywood masala flick the hosts knowledge about the game is smaller than the smallest of mouth organ yeah the one which makes sound it is like wrapping a chocolate up with tissues used in our bathroom we all like the chocolate what else can we do wash it in the sink and have it now i am having the chocolate i tastes well somewhat bitter so how does the god fearing indian go about now

8032090 i dont know of nor do i want to know any man or boy that
8032091 syncope may be benign and it may be the warning sign of something more serious
8032092 the fainting phenomenon understanding why people faint and what to do about it
8032093 one of the difficulties is that there are many things that can cause it
8032094 if you faint it could be due to a serious problem whenever theres a question its best to go ask your doctor
8032095 some people would do it as a put on it became the social norm
8032096 about 10 percent of the population has poor autonomic tone
8032097 if given the right set of stresses and strains theyll pass out
8032098 people will pass out laughing coughing sneezing and having orgasms
8032099 if you have an enlarged prostate and you have to strain to urinate you can pass out from that if youre really constipated and you strain really hard you can faint on the toilet thats called defecation syncope
8032100 theyll wake up on the floor in a pool of blood with a broken jaw their lives are ruined by this
8032101 some people will pass out when getting their hair done
8032102 its called hair grooming syncope if you yank on the hair of people who are predisposed to this they can pass out
8032103 nesting birds or small mammals carry their own set of parasites and although those parasites dont normally feed or interfere with humans if something happens to the mice or the birds that are nesting in your house the parasites will look for an alternative food source
8032104 upwards of 90 percent of all people have these mites living on their body on a permanent basis
8032105 as far as we know they dont cause any problems theres even speculation that theyre a beneficial parasite
8032106 there might be bugs on some of you mugs but there aint no bugs on me
8032107 these are people who will not have this reaction unless they exercise right after eating this food
8032108 eating shellfish and sitting there nothing but eating shellfish and exercising for these people its bad news
8032109 i dont think youre going to get it when youre bowling but if youre doing cardio or a hip hop class then yes
8032110 if they come to me im not going to tell them not to exercise
8032111 the invisible bugs crawling on their skin and in their bones
8032112 how will you make sure that you will fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8032113 tribesmen climb up homemade towers its sort of like the original bungee jumping
8032114 at the stroke of midnight they light them all on fire in a huge loud pyromania sic display
8032115 the books title meant you should live every day like it would be your last and theres not that many people who do
8032116 its a credit to dave he didnt have enough days but he lived them like he should have
8032117 were going to the future do you want to come along
8032118 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8032119 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
8032120 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8032121 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8032122 many monasteries in italy are dying because of a lack of religious vocations
8032123 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
8032124 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8032125 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
8032126 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8032127 we dont count by days we count by hours we think by tomorrow it will be finished
8032128 i wont yield my cabinet wont yield the military and the police wont yield
8032129 i wont leave until there is a political change if you want me to leave you will have to kill me and take my body out of here
8032130 we dont have numbers but we know it is happening people are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops
8032131 because of the slow growth rate of agave it is especially sensitive to the boom and bust agricultural cycle only played out in a slightly longer cycle
8032132 you tend an agave for six years and then the price drops on you or you get hit with a freeze or something its a lot of investment to lose
8032133 this would principally affect low quality tequila which will be altered so that it contains a lower percentage of agave
8032134 if people get more money for other crops they will stop growing agave and the price will rise its basic economics
8032135 the worst thing that could happen like an axe blow to the plane
8032136 youd have one motor pushing ahead and the other dragging in the opposite direction
8032137 as the md 82 plane has both engines on the tail close to the spine of the aircraft
8032138 i noticed the plane perhaps lacked speed then a wing dipped i clung to my seat and dont remember any more
8032139 yes i will put all my energy at the service of my beliefs
8032140 we have to propose an alternative path to the french to balance our public finances and increase investment
8032141 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was
8032142 the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
8032143 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft
8032144 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
8032145 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
8032146 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8032147 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8032148 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
8032149 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety
8032150 the crew cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8032151 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off
8032152 i am so lucky to be married to the woman who delivered that speech last night
8032153 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8032154 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
8032155 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
8032156 a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
8032157 military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table
8032158 i could have voted from my home she is our captain and we dont want to see her disrespected
8032159 we hope and expect bill clinton will give a stirring and perfectly acceptable speech
8032160 however if we see his face turning red and his forehead starting to throb well be there to pull the plug
8032161 the opening of the chicago office is a key milestone in our north american growth strategy giving us a central hub from which to effectively serve our new u s customers while also providing the base from which our sales efforts in the country will be driven
8032162 rick is an excellent addition to the sword ciboodle team and is the ideal person to spearhead the our growth in the region while howard brings the leadership and vision that will help us to capitalize on sword groups overarching north american strategy
8032163 with an incredible track record in delivering outstanding software solutions across the globe sword ciboodle is a company that is ready to crack the u s market
8032164 i am very excited to be part of the team that is responsible for achieving this and look forward to our success in doing so
8032165 if you see the words rider and addendum be very afraid
8032166 they dont work there just isnt any evidence they work the idea that we are making americans financially literate to handle their own credit and investment needs it is a fallacy
8032167 its an unthinking and simple solution to very complex problems
8032168 we cannot get away from empowering people because they have to make so many decisions
8032169 finding that the current programs dont work does not mean we shouldnt do it
8032170 i dont know of an example in which weve been able to do that
8032171 we point out all the scams and all the tricks the class lets them know you can fix a credit score how deeply that sinks in i dont know
8032172 in four weeks they really cant give you all the information you need but youre better off with the class than without it
8032173 im looking for a small place something to call our own
8032174 the addition of point2 agent to our realtors repertoire of services will allow for greater proficiencies leads and sales
8032175 todays home buyers and sellers in turn have access to the greatest web of prospects possible a win win for all
8032176 distribution trumps destination forward thinking mlss such as realcomp understand this simple fact
8032177 providing a single automatic solution for listing distribution to internet destinations of the brokers choice is a value added service provided by progressive mlss
8032178 once an agent takes this course they will never fear a down market again their career will be recession proof
8032179 most agents are successful in a good market but if they learn how to make sales in this kind of market they will always be successful
8032180 the course is excellent it provides you with everything you need right down to the language of the letters to send i am now doing several bpos and working for a few reo asset management companies
8032181 its the most exciting work to help your fellow man its a great reward if i can save just one person from foreclosure thats something to celebrate
8032182 if you were a buyer would you buy that house with more features and updates at a lower price or yours
8032183 mr and mrs seller i appreciate that you have given me the opportunity to market your home but no matter what great programs i offer im not good enough to overcome the market i still need to price it right so at least i can attract buyers to come through the home and then offer them these programs ninety percent of marketing especially in the early weeks is about pricing it in the right range now clearly i know i can negotiate the best deal for you and get you the highest net but not if the price is scaring the buyers away from even viewing your house
8032184 the key to selling more houses in todays tough real estate market is a sound system for compelling sellers to lower their price when appropriate there are three ways to expect consistent results and sell more listings one is to add an exhibit to your listing agreement that requires an upfront agreed upon pricing schedule another would be weekly updates to your seller outlining activity and explaining to them the reasons why they are not getting offers for example if you are getting lots of showings but no offers you are mostly likely 2 3 off on the target price if you have no showings and only drive bys the price is most likely 6 or more off a third system for securing price reductions is a 30 day review your job as an effective agent is to positively change the outcome for your clients every 30 days you should update the cma track which homes the buyers that previewed your listing bought and also track all recent sales and new competition you have an obligation to share this valuable information with the seller so they can make a good decision on selling
8032185 one of the biggest success roadblocks agents face is self imposed fear that fear can be as simple as being rejected by prospects who might not agree with what we have to say which clearly could affect whether or not we obtain new listings and whether we have the courage price them right you have to remember and believe that you are the expert in all aspects of residential real estate sales especially pricing homes forget all the sales gurus who tell you that you have to manipulate people or even hypnotize them how about giving them what they really want and need which is the truth people want to know that you are genuine and honest so you can bridge the gap of trust this gives them the comfort level to take a chance on you so tell them the truth even when its ugly and they will appreciate you much more than you think in order to obtain the correct price on a listing or secure a necessary price reduction you must develop this mindset and avoid creating the reputation of being a mediocre agent because you thought you were just being nice and doing the right thing for the client when in reality you were lying to yourself and your prospect because you know better as an expert
8032186 the real estate business model has evolved significantly in the past few years said gibson
8032187 much more is being done with technology from listings on the internet and customer relationship management to online financing and transactional data we are building a model from the ground up that takes advantage of available technologies and puts them to work for our agents and their clientele while ensuring a personal service based experience
8032188 this entrepreneurial structure positions our firm for growth and the way business is moving in addition our progressive internet presence our elite brokerage community network and our global reach will provide clients with unsurpassed marketing strength
8032189 for a dedicated agent work and life begin to integrate as work becomes more personal the people that you deal with on a daily basis become a part of your extended family and it is vital that the experience is pleasurable
8032190 at gibson international we know the value of a good support system and we want to be effective for our agents we understand what it takes for them to provide exceptional service while creating a work life balance
8032191 many real estate agencies say they are different from the others and this business model is just one of the proof points that we truly are
8032192 we are a company that knows change is constant and we want to ensure our agents are equipped to keep up with that change
8032193 people at our company will not only be recognized for their sales achievements but for what they add to the overall culture of the company a culture of success help professionalism pride of ownership community involvement and fun
8032194 video zac efron y vanessa hudgens jugando con mu ecos
8032195 que pena que uribe se defienda con su rabia y no con su inteligencia
8032196 we simply cannot allow this sort of brazen and inconsiderate defiance of state code
8032197 but nobody in the office was willing to deliver the notice while the mountain was still erupting
8032198 a a d q will we see uno ocho doce after all
8032199 how can someone with an annual income in the top 0 1 percent possibly be in touch with the average american
8032200 if youre like me and youve got an income no higher than the top 0 3 or 0 2 percent you might have a different perspective than john mccain
8032201 four million dollars i dont remember how much i made last year but im pretty sure it wasnt four million dollars i think
8032202 its just so hard to choose between the guy with a single two million dollar mansion and the guy with six or seven half million dollar houses
8032203 mccain owns six or seven houses right so that means hes losing even more money than most people with this housing bust
8032204 so in a way i think john mccain actually can relate to me better
8032205 with the south lake union line already running at nearly eight percent capacity we cannot afford to waste time on this new line
8032206 i have already purchased the property at 1165 harrison and will begin demolition of the existing structure as soon as we acquire permits from the city
8032207 its a real shame that we have to displace local businesses like this
8032208 but you cant create a new and vibrant neighborhood here without bulldozing at least a few of these eyesores
8032209 i had no idea that building this new streetcar would mean eliminating those people
8032210 if allen strikes us down we shall become more powerful than he could possibly imagine
8032211 also we plan to relocate to the giant pauls big toe once the statue is completed anyway so leaving this location is really no big deal
8032212 i got all kids down to the cellar right quick but then i realized that i didnt have my twine ball with me
8032213 it was like there was a supernatural force was carrying him ive never seen a man with such a purpose in all my life
8032214 i would say he was possessed by something stronger than the tornado
8032215 i saw my twine ball start to scoot across the floor and toward the black funnel i knew then what i had to do
8032216 its not just that mccain has changed a lot of his positions its the fact that hes so plainly changed them purely for the sake of political expediency
8032217 all you are thinking is that you have to survive
8032218 its a lot steeper than everest basically its a giant pyramid
8032219 there are no easy routes theyre all hard it also has its own weather system the good weather rarely lasts long enough to complete an ascent
8032220 i had been walking for four or five hours and it was starting to get light
8032221 you choose between life or the mountain at the time you are asking yourself is this the right decision but afterwards you realise its the right decision
8032222 rolf was on the wrong place at the wrong time but since k2 was one of rolfs dreams we have also said that he was at the right place at the wrong time
8032223 i would love it if everyone could contemplate this ocean of mountains and glaciers they put me through the wringer but its so beautiful the night will be long but beautiful
8032224 we were very tired we said then that we would bivouac camp for the night
8032225 just turning over in your sleeping bag can leave you fighting for breath
8032226 i had not drunk for 16 hours it was 8 000m and it was freezing cold
8032227 all of a sudden i saw an avalanche coming down it was only 20 metres to my right i saw the body of gerard sweep past me
8032228 following so closely on their righteous pride and that of the country it is truly heartbreaking that they must now contemplate the loss of a beloved son and brother
8032229 i was able to help marco i found him at 8 000m he was sitting in the snow unconscious he was completely flat lying down i had taken one small bottle of oxygen for emergencies and i was able to use that after about 10 or 15 minutes he started to move and became conscious
8032230 tonight will surely be yet another test of their courage as their limbs are thawed and the extent of their injuries is revealed
8032231 they were thinking of my gas my rope or whatever everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody was leaving each other
8032232 its hard to believe but our passion is in the mountains
8032233 if you die in the mountains it happens at the highlight of your life you are living for your passion if you die when you are 90 then that is great but for mountaineers its acceptable to die where your heart is
8032234 whose idea was it that the best way to transport a 6 foot 160 pound human was to put him into a 2 500 pound steel cage thats ridiculously inefficient and wasteful
8032235 but dont you think its silly to carry around that much empty space and emit all that exhaust just to sit motionless in traffic half the time anyway
8032236 dont i think what did i just say about thinking just do whats fun and easy convenience is king baby
8032237 but right now to get to work we sit around in our car for over an hour a day just to drive 40 miles round trip at a cost of over 150 per month and anyway arent you tired of being a slave to traffic

8032243 this j p patches statue doesnt seem controversial at all
8032244 if it doesnt offend people with outdated traditional moral values then whats the point
8032245 i just cant believe we are honoring a character that stands for such blatantly anti fremont values like washing your hands face neck and ears or sharing your toys
8032246 were very pleased to have a sales executive with such a stellar reputation as john
8032247 were experiencing tremendous growth and are confident hell drive our business to exceptional levels of achievement
8032248 dow jones has always been the dominant player for those needing timely news and competitive information
8032249 as we build on our capacities at dow jones im looking forward to leading an exceptional team that will establish dow jones business relationship intelligence as an industry leader around the globe
8032250 when mayor nickels announced car free days we knew we had to do something
8032251 weather is what we know so naturally it was our preferred weapon
8032252 if the city wants to close a mile and a half stretch of road to cars its only fair that we close it to pedestrians and bicycles too
8032253 have fun and see what the city could be like if we drive less
8032254 people drive their cars through here as if the roads were built for them or something
8032255 im all in favor of driving less but i dont understand why the city broke into my garage and towed my prius
8032256 nobody took advantage of the empty streets to do any of the sixteen entertaining and creative activities we listed on the car free day activities webpage
8032257 banks ignore these people because among other things theres no opportunity to cross sell products like home loans car loans and credit cards
8032258 but they still need the financial security of bank like services thats what we provide along with truly great service
8032259 our product just happens to be financial services solutions we want to raise the bar so high with our customer service that even if our customers went somewhere else theyd jump back to us due to that service differentiator
8032260 when our agent answers the call the customers account details immediately appear on screen armed with customer account information pulled from previous calls emails chat sessions and faxes our agents are more familiar with each customer and in turn more friendly
8032261 echopass provides a 30 percent increase in efficiency for our agents
8032262 that means fewer agents can answer more calls without sacrificing the quality of our service if anything our service is more focused and getting better which is contributing to our rapid growth
8032263 we were looking for a highly reliable system that was flexible and scalable
8032264 in selecting echopass we were impressed by its customer base in financial services as well as its technology platform and the redundancy and stability of the service
8032265 a passion for customer service today and tomorrow is a key focus of our business many of our customers tell us about the terrible treatment they had received from banks and other financial organizations
8032266 weve taken the exact opposite approach treating the customer as our sole reason for being our customer service and our agents have become the voice of accountnow and our partnership with echopass and their call center service which enables that voice is critical to guiding our ongoing success
8032267 organizations often lack the traceability and efficiency benefits of an integrated solution
8032268 while most companies use a source code management application few integrate it with their issue management tool to create a complete change management solution

8032272 weve always run great city programs but since the park redevelopment weve seen a boost in community turnout with this new facility we were able to add a master swim program more aquatic exercise classes and even host birthday parties
8032273 right now we are in the middle of an entire modernization program and gap really sets the tone for this movement the strength of the aquatics park is that it gives everyone from one year old to 90 years old the opportunity to use this facility
8032274 this facility brings a huge draw to the area weve had people come from as far as chico bringing in all these visitors provides us an opportunity to support our economic development which is so important right now
8032275 we worked collaboratively and imaginatively to create a sustainable well designed user friendly aquatic center and park space for this community

8032278 there was some other things inside his luggage they dont want me to list
8032279 it was a very strange itinerary in the sense he was going from dallas to san antonio he was only going to be in san antonio for an hour and then to washington d c
8032280 when you put together the electronic devices and the other items in his bag and the very bizarre travel intermarry thats why he was being held
8032281 why is there so many suspicious red flags surrounding one passenger
8032282 every conceivable type of construction project is contained in those volumes
8032283 some things can sit languishing in an office when other people would love to have that
8032284 we have a lot of people doing environmental impact studies wondering what materials a building was built with
8032285 last time there was disagreement and confusion over what was being proposed on ranch road 12 and it was in may so it was a low turnout election
8032286 when i think of the county as a whole and its debt structure and where we are headed id like us to be a little more restrained
8032287 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8032288 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation
8032289 research shows that there are not enough young ladies that are going into math and science
8032290 if that trend is going to continue or increase we have to pay attention to that
8032291 its more focused on the why rather than bombs exploding or bullets hitting walls in this country we typically teach physics for boys and then we wonder why girls dont sign up for physics
8032292 even in the past couple of years when you look at women who are graduating from college only one out of every 10 students is a woman who graduates in engineering and architecture
8032293 i need a new shirt something cool and sleek and airy something girls will love it needs to be like a designer label
8032294 i always say 35 years ago when i was a kid thats where i spent all my saturdays playing in the toy department
8032295 it was the heart and soul of summerside right from the beginning really
8032296 the overall focus was that it was probably the greatest asset that we had in the downtown core that could contribute to some revitalization
8032297 there were some people that were of the mind that it should be torn down and build a new building and there were others and i think others were the majority who wanted it retained and it brought back to life
8032298 we looked at the reports and felt that the building didnt have any huge surprises
8032299 in that respect it was almost like working with a new building
8032300 weve just tried to retain as much of the heritage characteristics of this building as we possibly could
8032301 aesthetically its quite appealing for people they like the warehouse environment
8032302 but also helping the city to do what they need to do to grow the downtown
8032303 we look forward to having it as a beehive of activity as it was 100 years ago

8032328 we have an additional 20 million in state borrowing guarantees we went from 50 million to 70 million
8032329 were already using 5 million of that for the tax exempt borrowing that leaves 15 million available
8032330 if we took 1 million out of the revolving credit line the amount eligible for state guarantee would be 14 million
8032331 if we paid back the 1 million and then borrowed another 2 million we would have only 12 million left in the state guarantee

8032334 the educational side of the new park will give people ways to take care of their waterways into the future
8032335 people dont realise that things like washing cars with detergents and using fertilisers near drains can contribute to degrading our waterways because the chemicals can end up in the water system
8032336 the phosphate they produce in their waste is a contributor to the algal blooms that degrade the lakes
8032337 we are trying to educate the public into not feeding them bread which is actually bad for the birds and for the lakes and to feed them away from the water

8032346 ive reported the cgc to police hundreds of times in the past few years
8032347 they always refused to follow up on my reports saying that mysterious late night deliveries and strange sounds that seem to emanate from underground were not enough evidence to open an investigation
8032348 the worst part was how it never made a sound
8032349 a time comes in your life when you finally get it

8032351 the business climate in washington is pretty challenging right now thanks to the seemingly endless amount of red tape the state forces you to go through to perform even the simplest of tasks

8032358 this is a preemptive strike against all the hateful bigots out there that simply do not understand the normal and natural flow of politics
8032359 it is utterly preposterous to suggest that the governor would somehow be influenced by these gifts
8032360 it really is amazing the crazy accusations that people will throw around in an election year
8032361 are quite clearly jealous of the tribes and of women
8032362 i rejected the gambling compact because i realized that realistically what would the state do with 140 million a year
8032363 i mean really washington states economy is literally the envy of the entire planet we dont need the tribes money

8032378 we should not be expecting or even demanding that skilled tradespeople go to university and complete an irrelevant three year degree so they can be on the same pay scale as uni trained teachers
8032379 the profession is haemorraging technical teachers due to poor remuneration why stay in teaching when you can get paid twice or three times the amount in industry
8032380 some schools cannot run their workshops correctly or are cancelling their engineering classes
8032381 it is a very viable occupation that can pay well the students who choose to do an apprenticeship or gain a qualification in the area will be able to work anywhere around the world
8032382 although schools can already give someone without a teaching qualification a limited authority to teach which allows them to take classes on a temporary basis

8032389 they were a little rough with me especially because i did not represent any danger to them
8032390 i dont think anybody would say i look dangerous or scary

8032409 we wrote the white paper to offer additional guidance for understanding the aberdeen report on event driven manufacturing intelligence as we parsed the data ourselves we found some interesting insights that didn at us on the first read specifically we found that ready access to actionable real time data is a key driver of best in class business performance

8032417 those folks who are giving money for campaigns and you know who im talking about
8032418 it is a battle for the heart of the democratic party
8032419 the democratic party is supposed to look out for poor and minority kids
8032420 for many years now the central debate in american education has been over just how much schools can do to improve the low rate of achievement among poor children while it is true that for decades the children of new orleans toiled in a substandard school system they have also continually faced countless other obstacles to success inadequate health care poorly educated parents exposure to high rates of violent crime and a popular culture that often denigrates mainstream achievement and though the hurricane washed away the school system it didnt wash away their other problems in fact for most children it compounded them with a whole new set of troubles wrecked homes frequent relocations divided families post traumatic stress were public schools really the right vehicle to attack all of those problems were a blazer and a necktie and a lot of hard work enough to get tony petite to college for hardrick and sanders and the dozens of other education reformers i spoke to in new orleans since my first trip there in march the answer was a firm yes they didnt deny the daunting spectrum of problems facing the children they were trying to educate but they said they believed they could overcome them in the classroom and that the new educational terrain in new orleans had significantly increased their chances of success

8032429 faculty have always assessed students in their classes to make sure they know how to do a particular skill but this is the first time were assessing particular outcomes targeted to each program every year college wide
8032430 well test two of the outcomes a year so we can assess all of them over the three years of the college plan
8032431 if the outcomes are negative we can recognize this year that we need to change something next year if we have good results well continue as is and assess two more outcomes
8032432 when you take the whole program youll have been exposed to all of these
8032433 if someone is just dropping in for a personal growth class in trigonometry they wont get data analysis but theyll get all the other four it is accountability over a whole program
8032434 if everyone in a program knows exactly what the students are supposed to learn everything can flow from that to meet your objectives
8032435 the goal is to be able to verify students are learning what we want them to learn regardless of the campus and to make changes if that isnt happening

8032543 however our study showed there is actually an increase in fat with age and it is more likely that the fat increase causes the baggy eyelids rather than a weakened ligament
8032544 there have been no studies to show that the orbital septum weakens
8032545 our findings may change the way some plastic surgeons treat baggy eyes
8032546 i have found it suitable to play my role writing books or in newspapers to shed light on what i believe to be the threat by iranian influence to global security the middle east and persian gulf regions
8032547 according to the suspects statements so far there is a strong suspicion that roni and marie are involved in violent abuse and the murder of rose
8032548 he confessed to investigators and reconstructed the events of that tragic night when he gave the child a blow a blow he did not expect to have such a result
8032549 he was under pressure panicked was very worried about his partners likely reaction and as a result took action to conceal the body
8032550 what weve found so far is merely the tip of the iceberg

8032553 certainly cases involving soldiers in the midst of a violent war are ones that belong within the military system
8032554 this court finds that defendants discharge was reasonably related to the governments interest in ensuring that its soldiers are fit to serve
8032555 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8032556 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8032557 i would watch a tv phenomenon with a mixture of amusement and disdain

8032559 in figuring the toughest cities in which to be sports fans over the past year we compared the latest median household income figures from the census bureau to the fan cost index for each team compiled by team marketing those metros with the lowest ratios of income to ticket cost were deemed most expensive for fans those ratios were then compared to team performance with regular season won lost records and playoff outcomes combined for all teams in a given city
8032560 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8032561 we have our engineers looking at it and were doing a complete investigation

8032577 are ones in which he questioned obamas readiness to be president
8032578 i didnt say that he was not qualified to become president
8032579 republicans in our debates pointed out differences on issues and relative capacity thats very different from saying that he is not qualified to be president
8032580 mccain has gotten a good look at mitt romney as a competitor and as someone who is running in support of his candidacy and frankly he cant tell the difference its been a very educational process lets just leave it at that
8032581 mitt romney suggested tuesday that criticisms he leveled at john mccain during the gop primaries would not block him from becoming the republican nominee for vice president
8032582 mitt romney suggested tuesday that criticisms he leveled at john mccain during the gop primaries would not block him from becoming the republican nominee for vice president arguing that he never questioned his one time rivals readiness to be president the way the democratic nominee for vice president questioned barack obama
8032583 this is americas convention and were using new technology this time like text messaging and google and youtube to really break down these walls to make this convention more open and interactive
8032584 we are going to be sending letters to the pastors in churches in our county introducing the movie and asking them to commit to see the movie with their spouse and one other couple in leadership from their church
8032585 we will also be taking out an ad in our local paper advertising the movie and asking them to come in and register for free tickets we will give away that week of the movie we are also involved or aware of several marriage enrichment small groups and will be offering free tickets to them
8032586 we are so excited about the movie and continue to pray daily for marriages to be changed because of this tool we will also continue to seek god for further direction

8032612 i saw the islands had heavy vegetation and i said lets give it a shot
8032613 this shows that you cant separate the marine and terrestrial environments you have to consider them working together
8032614 i would really like to see if this is happening in other fish
8032615 its really easy to speculate that without the leaves clownfish might not be able to find their homes

8032617 the rising severity of residential mortgage losses are driving credit costs higher and fannie maes operating earnings lower

8032620 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8032621 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem
8032622 the patterns broadly resemble what we saw at the smaller craters opportunity explored earlier
8032623 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time

8032644 ask not what you can do for the country ask whats for lunch
8032645 as there was a large number of talks not only had they to be parallelized but they also had to be scheduled from 8 30 in the morning to 10 oclock at night
8032646 how in such a short span of time these nitc folks have managed to make foss nitc a nationwide community event
8032647 there was a great number of creative contribution from the delegates which made the one and a half hour to be the
8032648 the organizers students belonging to various branches in nitc did a very nice job this is their 3rd year of conducting the foss meet and they did show signs of maturity

8032668 according to available information the bishkek inter district court of the kyrgyz republic today dismissed a lawsuit filed by a vice speaker of the parliament
8032669 the company therefore cautions that the courts ruling today does not resolve the principal matters at issue between the company and the kyrgyz republic
8032670 todays court ruling also has no effect on the previously reported june 17 2008 decision of the inter district court to invalidate the southwest and sarytor mining licenses and the kumtor exploration license that decision while under appeal remains in effect
8032671 in fact its almost 100 percent more this year than it was the previous two years
8032672 nothings 100 per cent sure and you never know whats going to happen in that world but everything that we have done has led towards that
8032673 a couple of months ago they rio tinto alcan released the preliminary funds to prepare the site and get started under the terms of the agreement that we had not yet signed off on
8032674 so thats a pretty clear indication that things are rolling
8032675 daytawion said he is not going to nebraska with david oku
8032676 i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it ill get some practice today and tomorrow well be ok i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
8032677 i cannot confirm at this time that an agreement has been reached although we are very close and i feel an announcement of an agreement is imminent
8032678 the result is that it is very strong and as a result of it being strong it is very safe
8032679 it is impossible for this maple bat to shatter in the way the maple bats shatter in the major leagues today you will never have a barrel separating from the handle the worst thing that can happen is a crack there is a never a catastrophic break
8032680 i was wonderin if your blush in smooth harmony is a limited edition color i cant find it on macs site thanks
8032681 have you picked out your dress yet for the pow wow
8032682 as i told our coaches if theyre cleared and able to perform even if its 15 20 plays i want them to play
8032683 the next week id like them to play 30 or 40 plays its hard to jump to 30 to 40 plays if you play zero in the first week i expect them to play
8032684 defensive coordinator joe tresey wants to see him today in our 2 mintue drill and see how he moves laterally
8032685 if he moves laterally well he can probably start him if hes still a little uncertain well get him in the flow of the game but we probably wont start him
8032686 you know the next man in is just as reliable as those two well rely on them to play the position it tells us that the next man in that comes to replace byrd and hoppel theyre going to have to play as fast as byrd and hoppel do
8032687 thats something thats going to go right up to gametime we feel optimistic hell play
8032688 im excited to see dustin grutza start and give him an opportunity to lead our football team
8032689 last year ben mauk had that opportunity and he made the best of it dustin didnt get that opportunity he has that opportunity this year and i think everybody is excited about him getting that opportunity and running with it with similar success
8032690 its not an issue for me heres what i know if you play winning football in cincinnati theyll come out and support you all my focus is putting an exciting football team on the field and winning i really dont care what the numbers are
8032691 our efforts are dedicated to the small family farmers ranchers artisan cheese makers laborers and cooks of the world whose endless work wisdom and passion make it possible to bring this food to the table

8032693 we randomly purchased 193 traditional indian ayurvedic medicine products from the internet about 60 percent were from u s companies and 40 percent from indian companies twenty one percent had significant levels of lead mercury and arsenic
8032694 many traditional indian practitioners believe quite strongly that if rasa shastra is done correctly it is safe
8032695 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8032696 its not an accident that ahpa members performed better weve called our members attention to the presence of heavy metals in plant materials lead is ubiquitous its in the soil and in the plants i dont think you can get these levels to zero but it is the manufacturers responsibility to know the amount and to limit it

8032698 its icky to go on and on about how much you love shelfari without mentioning youre paid by them
8032699 when you look at a book on amazon yes you see a lot of people who have commented on that book but you dont really have a relationship with those people
8032700 they might be thorough opinions or reviews but a review by someone you know or associate with would carry a lot more weight with consumers thats what we are building on
8032701 is a models individual weather correlated to the weather in the real world given the assumptions of the model and no input of actual weather data
8032702 is it not possible that a large portion of the current warming trend is a product of internal climate variability
8032703 how it is you decide that ghgs are responsible for a deterministic forced trend
8032704 why is the itcz at other latitudes generally displaced northward
8032705 with the greatest warming in the tropics generally being in the mid to upper troposphere does that mean the level of non divergence in the hadley cell will rise
8032706 in summary our results imply that the first step in a time series long correlation study should be the separation of the deterministic components from the stochastic ones otherwise wrong conclusions concerning possible memory effects may be drawn
8032707 rescaled range analysis is one of the classical methods used for detecting and quantifying long term dependence in time series
8032708 the ipcc report for instance is very clear in stating that the detection and attribution of climate changes is only clearly possible at continental scales and above
8032709 by correlating at the annual and other short term periods they are effectively comparing the weather in the real world with that in a model
8032710 furthermore by using only one to four grid boxes for their comparisons even the longer term 30 year forced trends are not going to come out of the noise
8032711 seasonal cycle shifts in hydroclimatology over the western united states
8032712 a fundamental and societally relevant conclusion from these studies is that the use of the ipcc model predictions as a basis for policy making is
8032713 the patagonian region neuqu n r o negro la pampa chubut santa cruz and tierra del fuego provinces temperature increase more frequent intense precipitations fluvial valley floods glacier diminution floods wood biomass fires desertification coastal erosion
8032714 for preparing climate change scenarios for argentina the global model hadcm3 uk on ipcc scenarios has been utilized a remarkable trend to decrease of precipitation is also observed for the central region of chile and the argentinean region of cuyo province of neuqu n and the western part of r o negro and chubut these scenarios indicate a continuity of the climatic trends observed during the last decades
8032715 in this study we investigate the weekly to monthly predictability of clouds and precipitation over the lsa east defined roughly by 33 430n latitude and 78 890w longitude
8032716 those irregularities affect weather which over the 30 years of the test becomes climate
8032717 although if i took the time i might be able to justify that view based on some physical arguments maybe
8032718 but dont you think there are some underlying patterns in the global climate that can be understood even with greatly simplified models the hadley cells for example
8032719 lsa east defined roughly by 33 43 degrees n latitude and 78 89 degrees w longitude
8032720 the issue is not developing an understanding it is testing a model the greatly simplified or somewhat simplified models cannot be tested because they do not faithfully simulate particular locations that can be compared to the same real world locations
8032721 42 kevinm im not sure thats a good analogy of what is being compared
8032722 however the earth is not a kettle and albany is not an indistinguishable location it has specific climate characteristics and weather patterns which can be simulated in climate models also the albany discrepancies are repeated for 7 more locations worldwide but is that enough locations to say the model is poor i dont know
8032723 so no number of locations would be enough because ks et al s research question is inapplicable in the first place
8032724 proving a negative is one of the top and common logic fallacies the default is that the cause does not exist until it is proven otherwise
8032725 so no number of locations would be enough because ks et al s research question is inapplicable in the first place
8032726 the number of heads coming up in a run of a particular length
8032727 in a climate model there is a lot of sensitivity to initial conditions and which particular small fluctuations occur in any particular run
8032728 lynn 77 i respect your zeal but asserting things that are prima facie contraindicated in support of your cause is not a good way to build your credibility viz a viz people you may be trying to convince at least in a logical and scientific environment
8032729 if every point in a model is inaccurate how would any aggregate statistic from the model have any validity
8032730 actually you are more interested in the behavior that persists across various initial conditions and in spite of fluctuations you are also interested in the range of behaviors the results of any single run are not that interesting thats why the paper is so baffling
8032731 a total of 1144 data records exist from the three data sources for the region west of the continental divide and south of 54 n of these 824 snow records have 1 april records spanning the time period 1950 97 and are used in most of the analysis for the temporal analysis a larger subset of the 1144 snow courses was used
8032732 data from the nearest five stations are combined into reference time series there is a total of 394 stations with good precipitation data and 443 with good temperature data
8032733 the credibility of the geographically distributed representation of climate by gcms
8032734 with 50 of the electricity coming from coal and with climate change legislation being enacted calling for targets and timetables and so on how do we continue to use our coal resource
8032735 their approach makes no sense unless you want to use gcms for long term weather prediction
8032736 contrariwise if it was so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isnt it aint thats logic
8032737 take enough runs and you will elucidate the physics of the system
8032738 if you shut your yap and thought maybe youd learn something
8032739 sweep this issue of weather vs climate under the rug
8032740 it is helpful to distinguish forcings that are important in the global mean from those which might be important locally but not have much impact for global warming
8032741 estimating the hurst parameter from observed data is very tricky business
8032742 climate the average of weather over at least a 30 year period note that the climate taken over different periods of time 30 years 1000 years may be different the old saying is climate is what we expect and weather is what we get
8032743 climate change a non random change in climate that is measured over several decades or longer the change may be due to natural or human induced causes
8032744 because global warming isnt just hidden in shorter term weather noise it may have an effect on that weather noise
8032745 its the average of the shape of the distribution of the variations of the shape of the distribution of every variable
8032746 one could comb the universe for similar planets to get more data like an ensemble of model runs
8032747 weve said over and again that short term weather events are difficult to impossible to attribute to climate change
8032748 here was katrina this is what may happen more as the climate warms
8032749 short term weather events are difficult to impossible to attribute to climate change
8032750 social facts not psychological or individual level facts cause social facts
8032751 my plants came up early my pond froze a month late cherry blossoms bloomed a few weeks early
8032752 why doesnt it just keep getting hotter and hotter yadda yadda year s were actually cooler than yadda yadda
8032753 this is real climate and that realisation is not an earthly climate
8032754 was the particular realisation that is the history of the earths climate likely
8032755 how well do the gcms perform at generating suitably high hurst coefficients
8032756 if adding a small lake completely throws off the global average
8032757 failing to help others often leads to shame which is a powerful negative emotion that is experienced when there is an inconsistency between a persons actual and desired self
8032758 paradoxically it is by helping others that we derive self benefits in the form of enhanced self esteem and social approval serving others connotes valued human traits including compassion cooperativeness and kindness
8032759 a slowing economy definitely affects donations to non profit organizations
8032760 we are doing our best to join the international community
8032761 it may have been a church full of pedophiles and criminals covering up other criminals sins it may have been a church riddled with hypocrisy deceit and corruption but our megachurch experience taught us that we were captive catholics
8032762 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
8032763 governments across the region have begun to tighten their laws on camcording
8032764 to enhance opportunities for latinos in front of and behind the camera
8032765 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life

8033142 once upon a time about a month ago senator john mccain was mocking the celebrity of his rival senator barack obama comparing him in a television commercial to paris hilton and britney spears
8033143 but on monday mr mccain showed that he was not against bold faced types per se hobnobbing in company that is decidedly more us weekly and billboard than congressional quarterly or council on foreign relations in its nature
8033144 i was a little disappointed in not being able to introduce cindy as was originally planned as she is a beer heiress and im irish catholic she said according to a pool report drawing laughs from the crowd

8033165 we have had the privilege of meeting some outstanding men and women recruiting them to taylor watching them flourish and seeing them make an impact in the world
8033166 taylors tradition of global engagement is not a recent phenomenon
8033167 from taylors earliest days our students faculty staff and alumni have served and studied in many different overseas settings
8033168 taylor university is recognized as being a highly selective academic institution where students with vibrant spiritual lives live primarily on campus or in university approved housing
8033169 it is who we are we are pleased given current economic realities that our enrollment continues to be high evidencing a demand for a taylor educational experience
8033170 we are excited to welcome an extraordinary freshman class along with new and distinguished faculty members as we begin this our 163rd year we are all rededicating ourselves to the purposes of god for his kingdom and the work he is doing at taylor university

8033197 we were simply blessed by god that no complication happened if there had been a complication ghazala would have died
8033198 you cannot take this risk because of the complications to the mother and the babies
8033199 even if she had a period of infertility thats an indication that you should be careful when you stimulate
8033200 the important question to ask is why did she want to become pregnant after already having three children
8033201 its because she had three daughters and didnt have a boy in many parts of egypt if she doesnt have a boy its as if she didnt have children at all
8033202 its just so rare that all the eggs would get fertilized with regular intercourse
8033203 i have performed several reductions and have never had a case where i lost all the fetuses she needed to know that
8033204 there are just no rules or protocols for doctors to follow in this country
8033205 laws will be passed and they are not followed or implemented no one had any idea what to do when it came to ghazalas births it sort of all just happened
8033206 women can actually get pregnant with seven eight or nine babies
8033207 we need to tell people that it is safe and that it is ok religiously
8033208 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8033209 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8033210 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8033211 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8033212 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8033213 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8033214 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8033215 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8033216 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8033217 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8033218 the only place these people want to be is home and they cant go home because of what has happened to them and because of the situation that the russians have caused
8033219 there is a lot to do here and my job in all of this is to make sure that the international community does not forget what is going on here
8033220 and more importantly that we make sure to continue to bring light to the difficulties and the future difficulties that may occur particularly with a hard winter coming
8033221 were sitting here every day waiting to see what our government will do
8033222 what you just heard was the birth of a conspiracy between two different men with a single desire to win
8033223 we only represent terry christensen we have our problems with mr pellicano
8033224 if she were to testify she could have refuted the facts
8033225 ive lost money on this case theres nothing left of the mission
8033226 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8033227 we sent out a press release one day saying we were on the verge of closing it down and the next day we had us 500 000
8033228 they shine the light on the real emergencies and step up where we really need help
8033229 its all going to depend on where is the overall market and then specifically where is the c compact car segment of the market
8033230 in east liberty ohio honda is able to build the civic the cr v and the element

8033233 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench
8033234 this work must continue and government must find new ways to empower and strengthen these armies of compassion
8033235 as president john mccain will nominate judges who understand that their role is to faithfully apply the law as written not impose their opinions through judicial fiat
8033236 john mccain believes that the right of law abiding citizens to keep and bear arms is a fundamental individual constitutional right that we have a sacred duty to protect
8033237 in 1993 john mccain and his wife cindy adopted a little girl from mother teresas orphanage in bangladesh
8033238 the family represents the foundation of western civilization and civil society and john mccain believes the institution of marriage is a union between one man and one woman it is only this definition that sufficiently recognizes the vital and unique role played by mothers and fathers in the raising of children and the role of the family in shaping stabilizing and strengthening communities and our nation

8033265 die avond was er niets ergs gebeurd ja hij heeft me wel betast enzo maar verder niets toen zijn de jongens naar hem beginnen zoeken enzo en de dag erna ben ik hem terug tegengekomen en toen we zijn gaan winkelen heb ik hem ook gezien hij volgt me overal volgens mij weet hij zelfs op welke kamer ik slaap hij stuurt de hele tijd briefjes naar me dat hij me wil en dat we samen gelukkig kunnen worden en dan heeft hij me een keer bedrijgt hij wil het beste voor me en hij vond het niet eerlijk dat ik met tom de hele tijd bezig ben en dat ik hun op hem afstuur als dat nog een keer ging gebeuren ging hij bill afmaken en niemand zou het merken want hij lijkt er perfect op en de jonges zijn blijven zoeken ik kon toch moeilijk zeggen dat het niet meer nodig was ik wist echt niet meer wat te doen
8033266 het is niet jullie schuld maar ik ben zo bang dat er jullie iets zal overkomen door mij

8033281 but they always had holes or were damaged never had we found a whole tomb like this one intact
8033282 de vrouw kon nog wel de locaties waar ze heen werd gebracht beschrijven aan de hand daarvan hebben we reconstructies gemaakt van bijvoorbeeld huizen straten en kanalen die we in opsporing verzocht hebben laten zien we hopen dat kijkers deze locaties herkennen en ons daarover kunnen informeren dan weten we tenminste waar we het onderzoek eventueel moeten starten dat kan in drenthe zijn maar ook elders in nederland of zelfs in het buitenland
8033283 is dat het hier in elk geval gaat om een goed georganiseerde bende mensenhandelaren uit waarschijnlijk het voormalige oostblok en dit gebeurt meer bij de politie in groningen zijn onlangs twee soortgelijke aangiftes van vrouwen binnengekomen we weten echter nog niet of die zaken te linken zijn aan de zaak van de armeense vrouw ook daar hopen we binnenkort duidelijkheid over te hebben
8033284 i have risen in the rankings without competing for tournaments i want to do well and there is no better place to do it than in belfast
8033285 now i am in the top 16 i need to be competing for tournaments regularly
8033286 this is a big season for me and that will make me concentrate even more i want to do well for myself but also for the supporters that come to watch me
8033287 anyone who saw me in interviews after that match could see i was very very disappointed
8033288 not because i lost but because of the way i lost i felt i had played the better snooker over the whole match and deserved to win
8033289 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8033290 mattel has pursued this case first and foremost as a matter of principle
8033291 we have an obligation to defend ourselves against competitors who choose to engage in fraudulent activities against us
8033292 jail staff should be aware of the possibility that he would use anything he has in his possession as a weapon against himself
8033293 when i went out there for people not even to say were sorry for your loss and they just look at you and basically throw stuff in your arms and push you out the door they dont care they dont care about anyone in there
8033294 and i know that people think people in jail are bad but people make mistakes and they are human
8033295 we just want to find out what happened because we think thats what my brother deserves
8033296 while we had turned up a lot of the information i think the ksp investigation has really now solidified what occurred at the jail with regards to daniels death
8033297 if he took his medicine he wouldnt have done the things he done
8033298 i just want them to know that my brother was not a bad person
8033299 he made mistakes and yes he was in jail but everyone is human and everybody makes mistakes who is to say that he wasnt going to change his life
8033300 well never know because hes not here with us they took that from us
8033301 if somebody wants to let somebody park on their yard so be it and if some neighbor doesnt like it they can do whatever they want in their yard
8033302 its only five or six days a year youd think people would want to help celebrate it
8033303 well cooperate of course but they will find no problem
8033304 obviously i am disappointed that this error occurred when i formed my campaign committee i sought the aid of experienced attorneys cpas and former elected officials in the end however i take full responsibility and im willing to take the steps necessary to make things right

8033328 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
8033329 zal has been a voice of strong criticism that goes way beyond u s policy of the government of karzai and that opinion reflects his personal view
8033330 this has been a problem going back two years on the pakistan account
8033331 the pakistan political situation is highly unstable right now and the last thing the u s needs is for it to become the central focus of that instability through accusations that it is propping up or scheming behind the scenes with one of the major political players
8033332 pakistani leaders are also guilty of putting too much attention on currying favor with u s leaders rather than focusing on governing their own country and dealing with the myriad of challenges there
8033333 he is the former ambassador to iraq and afghanistan his close relationship to the president has been acknowledged
8033334 you are a player and if another leader is looking to you for help and advice they have to assume it is coming from the upper echelons of the government
8033335 it is irresponsible to engage in that dialogue while you are a sitting official and taking an oath to be a representative of the u s government
8033336 i cant just give you the rights you seek i wish i could i agree with everything youve said to me now go out and make me do it
8033337 the iraq war has made the u s less safe from terrorism
8033338 the u s should not attack another country unless it has been attacked first
8033339 the government is spending too much for national defense and military purposes
8033340 the state of moral values in the country as a whole is getting worse
8033341 we found that government spending in aggregate has tracked upwards slightly over the past two years
8033342 traditionally the culture sector has been recognized for its multi faceted role in contributing to individual and community development social cohesion and quality of life
8033343 however in recent decades there has been growing understanding and examination of the substantial economic contribution of arts and cultural industries and of their central role in the creative economy
8033344 countries around the world as well as many cities and regions recognize that a dynamic culture sector plays a key role as a magnet for talent enhances economic output and acts as a catalyst for prosperity
8033345 shoutfest is more than another christian event or rock concert we consider it to be a real ministry opportunity for the local church
8033346 our overall goal is to lose the title tour and transform this into a tool that local churches and youth leaders can use to raise awareness and impact lives for christ ultimately leaving each market with a lot of young lives closer to gods kingdom and in a relationship with local ministries who will be there in the days and weeks following when those kids start to encounter real issues this puts the focus where it should be on the local church
8033347 our deep relationship with book of hope usa and others continues to build on the concept of making this thing a tool of the local church how many young people are literally dying inside all the while thinking that no one in their day to day lives could ever truly understand what they are going through this is why i do what i do we are here to equip the local church with relevant information and resources as well as providing a killer rock show

8033370 i think some people take it too much like cold hard fact and base their information on that
8033371 were moving into an opinionated way of receiving news and youre going to have to look through those opinions to be able to form your own
8033372 with limited visibility the russians were forced to rely on technology to identify friend from foe in the fog of war a process that is never easy

8033410 we view allegations of any sexual misconduct towards children with grave concern we are concerned for the wellbeing of any child whether they now be adult or not who may have been subject to abuse
8033411 we strongly support the process of thoroughly investigating allegations of sexual misconduct towards children
8033412 i understand the reason for that was that the vincentians could have fought the matter in civil court and it would have been very costly with regard to legal costs to them even if they had won unless costs were awarded against the alleged victim
8033413 they got a group between eight and 12 of us together and theyd just start chanting and i would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on

8033416 this will be a propitious year to go on pilgrimage as a diocese to rome to greet the holy father and to visit the basilica where the remains of our martyred patron rest
8033417 huesca is adorned in its best regalia during these celebrations of lawrence fruit of the ingenuity and dedication of institutions that fill the city with magic

8033433 the intense atmosphere of sad loneliness caused by his schuberts delicate state of health and his sentimental and professional disappointments
8033434 it is an interior journey that the celebrated austrian composer wrote in 1827 just one year before his premature death at the age of 31
8033435 when schubert brings a poetic text into his universe of sound he performs it through a melodic link that penetrates the soul with sweetness bringing the listener to feel his same nostalgic consummation the same call of that truth of the heart that goes beyond all rationality in this way a picture is born that speaks of genuine everyday life of nostalgia of introspection and of the future
8033436 the spontaneous and exuberant young schubert was successful in communicating to us here tonight as well what he lived and experienced he is worthy therefore of the universal acclaim that is given to this illustrious genius of music who honors european civilization and the great culture and spirituality of christian and catholic austria
8033437 comforted interiorly by the splendid musical experience of tonight we renew our gratitude to those who have promoted this concert and those who have magnificently performed it
8033438 shift from full time cfia meat inspection presence to an oversight role allowing industry to implement food safety control programs and to manage key risks
8033439 the perception in how its being presented at this time is that we are walking away we will not have presence or we wont be carrying out inspections and that in fact is not the case
8033440 what we talking about is recognizing there is a very clear responsibility on the part of industry government can never regulate or inspect its way to total food safety
8033441 the gang of 10 has six new members and im proud to be a part of this bipartisan team we need a comprehensive approach to reduce energy prices that examines short and long term options there is no silver bullet as ive criss crossed south dakota this summer ive heard from countless south dakotans feeling the pain of high fuel prices this group is putting politics aside to form a plan that takes our nation forward
8033442 the government introduced child trust funds as a way of helping parents plan for their childrens futures however our research has shown that parents are not making the most of this opportunity parents dont have to pay tax on the interest earned on a ctf account and by not using their full funding allowance each year they may potentially be gifting the taxman more money than necessary

8033457 were a pair who can bring great joy to juve the gaffer can count on us
8033458 juve showed that were in good shape both physically and psychologically we have a winning mentality now well concentrate on serie a
8033459 we didnt want to lose so we achieved the result we wanted

8033462 los choques que antes protagonizaban remiseros ahora en un 80 son de motociclistas
8033463 para nosotros los accidentes de tr nsito son una epidemia
8033464 estos datos fueron presentados en el congreso argentino de trauma
8033465 hoy tener una moto es como tener un arma porque comprar una moto es m s f cil que comprar un refrigerador
8033466 los menores las pueden comprar f cilmente sin tener carnet de conductor y sin saber manejarlas
8033467 lo que hace falta agreg es que las familias tomen conciencia sobre los riesgos que significa conducir una moto
8033468 this is a wake up call for us and were still grateful for our donors and supporters our committee needs to look at what our plans are for next year
8033469 a los ejecutivos de esta gran empresa quiero agradecerles la confianza que depositaron en la rep blica argentina que vale m s que la inversi n sobre todo cuando viene de una empresa internacional
8033470 sobre todo cuando escuchamos a un connacional que no tiene tanta confianza en el pa s
8033471 para el desarrollo de cualquier modelo es muy importante que los hombres que deciden las inversiones tengan confianza y amor por lo que hacen
8033472 vamos a profundizar este modelo que tantas satisfacciones le ha dado no a un sector sino fundamentalmente a todos los argentinos que han logrado recuperar calidad de vida a trav s del trabajo y del salario
8033473 est acreditado que lo que le ocurri al ex legislador no fue un hecho aislado fue consecuencia de un plan tenebrosamente planificado un plan que quer a instaurar una tiran a y una dictadura por todos los tiempos
8033474 a malicious attempt to link senator obama to domestic terrorist activities
8033475 it was important to me that these new racks be the same thickness and material as the existing racks to help identify them as practical bike racks and not just modern art
8033476 the locations are about as perfect as one could imagine wall street for the dollar sign and bergdorfs for the giant high heel
8033477 wallace isnt exactly known for his up to the minute fashion sense but i know hes feeling pleased with himself

8033479 i guess it took a while for it to finally register the hardest time was after i told the children and my sister and dealing with their emotions
8033480 the midwest has a rich history of being pioneers in agricultural production and research and now throughout the heartland there are many pioneers in agriculture and biorenewables that are changing the world for the better
8033481 the american ag amp energy council was formed to ensure the american public understands and takes pride in the resources and technological advancements the ag industry has made to benefit america and the world
8033482 the american ag amp energy council is made up of concerned educators entrepreneurs and leaders in the agriculture industry who believe in promoting all the good the industry does through education and sound research based public policy
8033483 the agricultural industry has evolved over the past 25 years and there is a stronger demand on the american farmer to provide food fiber and fuel for the world
8033484 in order to promote the industry and ensure continued rural development the american ag amp energy council will fulfill an absolutely necessary purpose
8033485 this coalition will bridge the sectors of the modern ag and renewable industries and help provide positive leadership and solutions for all of america
8033486 there is such a wonderful story to be told about the strength of what is happening in the heartland of america that not only helps feed the world but is vital to our nation achieving energy independence
8033487 and in addition modern agriculture is providing an enormous stimulus to the rural american economy unlike anything ever in the history of our country
8033488 that is a story that must clearly be told and policies to continue these great achievements must be embraced moving forward
8033489 it was exactly double of what it had been before we havent receive any previous notices of that
8033490 weve been very conscientious about how often we run our dryer leaving lights on that kind of thing so no weve been making efforts to save energy and for it to still be double is very questionable
8033491 its frustrating it really is were actually going today to pay our bills so they dont shut it off tomorrow
8033492 one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in miniskirts and high heels twenty four seven and go to the gym in heels
8033493 shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role
8033494 i do still have that side of me that soft sensitive side and i think that carmen is the more aggressive part of me there are moments when i am so that little girl from cincinnati ohio where she grew up and i cry and im just like everybody else you know i have all the same feelings that everyone else has
8033495 all contestants must be dressed up in funky fun german attire
8033496 the money was supposed to go towards our vacation but we probably lost that much in the casinos
8033497 whether were together or not in 10 years 20 years 40 years well have the magazine layout to look at and remember some incredible sex filled times
8033498 ill meet a guy and start dating and well have sex and then in a few months hell try to get me to lose weight and do this or that
8033499 i was always a popular girl with more boyfriends than i could date in a week
8033500 i was always a popular girl with more boyfriends than i could date in a week
8033501 i made my boyfriend really beg and grovel before i said that id pose for nn

8033508 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8033509 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8033510 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8033511 i just dont think he gets it he is out of touch i dont think he realizes what ordinary american families are going through
8033512 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8033513 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8033514 placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8033515 this is our time to revive the spirit of kennedy
8033516 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8033517 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8033518 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8033519 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8033520 all you need is 200 people in the crowd to boo and stuff like that and it will be replayed 900 times and thats not what you want out of this
8033521 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
8033522 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
8033523 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
8033524 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
8033525 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8033526 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8033527 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8033528 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8033529 a lot of people inside and outside of the clinton campaign expected her to be a very formidable and eventually a successful candidate
8033530 so she had both the benefit of and the burden of lots of expectations
8033531 have you dealt with the chance that you wont be the nominee
8033532 the idea that if you look and act like a presidential nominee then people are gonna come to think of you that way
8033533 the problem with that strategy is that its easily shattered
8033534 you know this is very personal for me its not just political its not just public i see whats happening and we have to reverse it
8033535 clinton was at her absolute best at that point clinton basically tossed her advisors overboard
8033536 the reason shes a u s senator the reason shes a candidate for president the reason she might be a front runner is her husband messed around
8033537 and from that moment forward clinton really didnt have the resources to compete in the feb 5th states the way obama did
8033538 i mean you can point to that period in february as basically having been the deciding time in the race
8033539 her message didnt match the moment the change message that barack obama had from day one was that message for this moment
8033540 for the next woman who runs for president they dont have to wonder what the model looks like
8033541 there are many good things that are going to come out of hillary clintons campaign and addressing that is one of them
8033542 although we werent able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you its got about 18 million cracks in it
8033543 historically weve had more collisions and have more fatalities on long weekends and pay attention at all intersections weve had 11 fatalitiesthis year so far in traffic accidents and almost half of those have been pedestrians
8033544 you know there has to be some converstations undertaken with translink and the minister of transportation
8033545 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8033546 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8033547 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8033548 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8033549 were still receiving tips that some of the other fugitives at least one or two of the other fugitives could be in
8033550 working that angle very hard and thats going to be a very high priority focus
8033551 its a great way to get to the destinations while its still pristine the birds nest is still in good condition and the water cube aquatic centre you want to go there while the energy is high
8033552 were very fortunate here on the west coast because we do have great flights and packages over to beijing now the number of callers are inquiring about the trip and the great packages that are available right now
8033553 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8033554 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8033555 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8033556 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8033557 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8033558 a person came up behind him asked him for money he said i dont have any money and then this man just stabbed him in the stomach without any provocation
8033559 we spent an enormous amount of money and time and a full time unit of people looking under every stone it wasnt like we did not know anything about her
8033560 and we thought her position on this was pretty reasonable
8033561 ive tried not to have long discussions about short lists long lists but ive said publicly before and i will repeat again that you know senator clinton would have been on anybodys shortlist and so i took her very seriously
8033562 no meetings no conversations no requests for information no real consideration whatsoever
8033563 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8033564 both because she wants a democrat in the white house and because she does not want to be blamed if we dont have one
8033565 she wants to go above and beyond to ensure that if it doesnt happen nobody points the finger at her
8033566 shes emerged from this campaign as an even more powerful force and shes going to map out a strategy where she can make a difference in peoples lives

8033575 shows 46 of national registered voters backing john mccain and 44 supporting obama
8033576 the one thing i learned while running in japan was how to persevere even in the most difficult conditions i think i was perfect in persevering today
8033577 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
8033578 clearly the message is the parties need to compete in the marketplace rather than the courtroom
8033579 we think the jurys finding is a significant rebuke to mattels aggressive and overreaching tactics
8033580 she indicated that her husband an attorney has told her clients who are iranian are stubborn rude stingy are thieves and have stolen other persons ideas
8033581 remarks would have no affect on any deliberations or decision
8033582 that the other jurors gave no weight to her the suspect jurors statements and beginning with the foreperson strongly rebuked
8033583 reacted to extraneous potentially prejudicial information exactly as society would have them react
8033584 this is a great opportunity i hope virginians regardless of partisan affiliation wish me luck tonight because you know weve got a great story to tell in virginia we didnt get it all right but we sure as heck made some progress and the same kind of focus on independence and results that we brought in virginia that could go a long long way in washington
8033585 after investigating the building we went through the entire school and found two interior windows also busted out
8033586 not something that i wanted to spend the day dealing with we were able to get everything taken care of prior to students coming into the building and had a normal day here
8033587 its very unfortunate but hopefully theyll find out what exactly took place who the individual or the individuals are involved and well get it solved
8033588 succeeded she did exactly what she was going for because today were talking about the message more than just the overall bling
8033589 and you know shes going to wear something she looks great in that she feels confident in and thats what we saw and she pulled it off very very well
8033590 she didnt want to look too blinged up she didnt want to be too bright i thought she was very simple very understated which might be a good idea because in this era of attack ads the mccain people are saying hey the obamas are elitist theyre caught up in celebrity if she came out in a real fancy dress that would just be more fodder for them
8033591 it was inspired its a neat look women all across the country can do it its a simple v neck three quarter length sleeve woll dress it can be a jersey knit add a pendant youve got something different
8033592 south africa wanted to impress the world by staging a world cup we did not need we needed jobs houses first class health facilities good education non cut throat food and petrol prices and not a world cup we could hardly afford
8033593 i think thats great news for all virginians whether you support obama or mccain it means both presidential candidates actually have to come to va and make their case for too long because we werent competitive both parties ignored virginia during presidential years and i dont think virginians had their voices heard
8033594 he will be supporting the democratic party he will be supporting barack obama and joe biden and he will be validating a lot of his own work
8033595 he certainly did very well when he ran in republican areas of the state and barack obama wants to use him to show that the democratic party is not just concentrated on its liberal base
8033596 it was actually an easy transition because we had two historic candidates here and in my opinion are not too far apart in terms of their core values and what i believe in
8033597 we know beyond the shadow of a doubt that if you are attacked in an ad you must attack back
8033598 research shows people are persuaded for attack ads one of the reasons is there is a fair number of folks who believe that everything said in an ad is truth
8033599 i hold certain values in life and i dont let any negative media comments sway that
8033600 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience he will bring to the white house
8033601 studies show that people remember an attack ad more often than they remember any other kind of ad
8033602 the kids are enjoying it they dont care get a little early fall i guess
8033603 yeah i mean its going to take a lot more work to really alleviate the drought considering weve only had 10 to 15 of normal rain
8033604 when the ground is very dry and the rain comes down very hard its kind of like the desert it doesnt absorb the moisture or the rain as quickly
8033605 the colors arent as vibrant as they typically are during a good wet year but we will still have color
8033606 the field across in front of me he usually gets two or three cuts off it already and he only has one so the feed for the cows is gonna be low
8033607 pastures are drying up crops are drying up and right now everything in agriculture is very critical
8033608 it will help the farmers get very low interest loans to help them
8033609 the growing period is gone so it will help but no it will not solve our problems
8033610 we need fay to come on up and bring us some beneficial rain not as much as they got in florida but we need to take what we can get
8033611 vets for freedom will not stand by and let the incredible progress of our troops go unnoticed by the american public and lawmakers from either side of the aisle
8033612 they have not put forward a plan to relieve our reliance on foreign oil so if it were up to them it seems that we would continue our reliance on foreign oil producers many of whom are very hostile to our interests
8033613 some men see things as they are and say why
8033614 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of moral crisis preserved their neutrality
8033615 as soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying settlers from our species of man will not be lacking on the moon and jupiter given ships or sails adapted to the breezes of heaven there will be those who will not shrink from even that vast expanse
8033616 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8033617 he didnt have enough days but he lived them like he should have

8033621 as soon as somebody demonstrates the art of flying settlers from our species of man will not be lacking on the moon and jupiter given ships or sails adapted to the breezes of heaven there will be those who will not shrink from even that vast expanse
8033622 some men see things as they are and say why
8033623 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of moral crisis preserved their neutrality
8033624 some men see things as they are and say why
8033625 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of moral crisis preserved their neutrality

8033850 senate resolution 636 a bi partisan resolution in the united state senate sponsored by senators lieberman and graham
8033851 we dont need more spin about how the surge is succeeding in doing what it was supposed to do which is to get the iraqis to stand up and take responsibility for their own future so we can start sending our troops home
8033852 i welcome the genuine reductions of violence that have taken place although i would point out that much of that violence has been reduced because there was an agreement with tribes in anbar province sunni tribes who started to see after the democrats were elected in 2006 you know what the americans may be leaving soon and we are going to be left very vulnerable to the shias we should start negotiating now thats how you change behavior
8033853 so i think it is fair to say that the president has simply tried to gain another six months to continue on the same course that hes been on for several years now it is a course that will not succeed
8033854 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
8033855 so far i think we have not seen the kind of political reconciliation thats going to bring about longterm stability in iraq
8033856 but the same factors that led me to oppose the surge still hold true the strain on our military has grown the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated and weve spent nearly 200 billion more in iraq than we had budgeted iraqs leaders have failed to invest tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues in rebuilding their own country and they have not reached the political accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge
8033857 obama will immediately begin to remove our troops from iraq he will remove one to two combat brigades each month and have all of our combat brigades out of iraq within 16 months
8033858 the problem the surge the goal of the surge was to create space for iraqs political leaders to reach an agreement to end iraqs civil war at great cost our troops have helped reduce violence in some areas of iraq but even those reductions do not get us below the unsustainable levels of violence of mid 2006 moreover iraqs political leaders have made no progress in resolving the political differences at the heart of their civil war
8033859 the overall strategy is failed because we have not seen any change in behavior among iraqs political
8033860 and it is very important at this stage understanding how badly the presidents strategy has failed
8033861 my assessment is that the surge has not worked and we will not see a different report eight weeks from now
8033862 given the deteriorating situation it is clear at this point that we cannot through putting in more troops or maintaining the presence that we have expect that somehow the situation is going to improve
8033863 and then we sat down with barack obama to talk about what has become an open disagreement between military commanders here and obama over his plan to withdraw all u s combat troops from iraq on a 16 month timetable did general petraeus talk about military concerns about your timetable
8033864 you know i would characterize the concerns differently i dont think that theyre deep concerns about the notion of a pullout per se there are deep concerns about from their perspective a timetable that doesnt take into account what they anticipate might be some sort of changing conditions and this is what i mean when i say we play different roles my job is to think about the national security interests as a whole and to have to weigh and balance risks in afghanistan in iraq their job is just to get the job done here and i completely understand that
8033865 but the difference is real commanders here want withdrawals to be based on conditions on the ground obama emphasizes his timetable but he insists he would remain flexible im going to try to pin you down on this
8033866 here let me say this though terry because you know what i will refuse to do and i think
8033867 di tre cose ero del tutto certa primo edward era un vampiro secondo una parte di lui chiss quale e quanto importante aveva sete del mio sangue terzo ero totalmente incondizionatamente innamorata di lui
8033868 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
8033869 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero
8033870 hes planning for his future it aint like brett favre these are two different scenarios brett favre didnt even try to find another job he was out there throwing to high school kids strahan hasnt hes been doing his fox thing
8033871 if there is somebody that can do it he can probably do it
8033872 but i dont know if its in his best interests
8033873 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8033874 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8033875 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8033876 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8033877 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8033878 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8033879 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8033880 most of the time its not taught in school the typical family either doesnt have time to teach their kids about money or views it as a low priority so the kids do too
8033881 and what motivates kids to get involved is activities and rewards
8033882 i want to make a difference in kids lives while teaching them the business of day to day living
8033883 demonstrate that graduating high school seniors continue to struggle with financial literacy basics
8033884 even when they do graduate many kids dont understand money the biggest reason kids drop out of college in the first year is credit card abuse they run up big balances and have to quit and go back to work
8033885 based on a technique developed at uc irvine called trace trees
8033886 a few of us have spent the last two months and most of the last few nights teaching spidermonkey some exciting new tricks
8033887 tracing follows only the hot paths and builds a trace tree cache
8033888 another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
8033889 even with this very very early version were already seeing some promising results
8033890 there are many wins left in each one of those benchmarks and well be working on those through firefox 3 1 and beyond
8033891 but were charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1
8033892 we have right now x86 x86 64 and arm support in tracemonkey
8033893 this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
8033894 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one

8033901 gli spettatori volevano vedere pi scene con jacob quindi mi hanno ritagliato un posticino nella scena del ballo alla fine del film

8033917 snuggels tightens the vaginal area by contracting the pores drawing together the soft organic tissues and shrinking mucous membranes of exposed tissues creating a tightening sensation of the skin
8033918 and afterwards the vaginal opening feels tighter many women develop vaginal elasticity issues due to childbirth or aging which in turn can decrease sensitivity reduce the ability to achieve orgasms and create a loss of bladder control
8033919 unlike liquid lubricants california fantasies snuggels creams are specially formulated to eliminate any sticky feeling are mess free and easy to apply
8033920 a fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
8033921 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with
8033922 i n the majority of cases a consideration of fair use prior to issuing a takedown notice will not be so complicated as to jeopardize a copyright owners ability to respond rapidly to potential infringements the dmca already requires copyright owners to make an initial review of the potentially infringing material prior to sending a takedown notice indeed it would be impossible to meet any of the requirements of section 512 c without doing so a consideration of the applicability of the fair use doctrine simply is part of that initial review
8033923 whoa i dont know if youre the man that i knew

8033968 at the moment rugby is my saviour i let that do the talking thats how i express my expressions
8033969 if im representing the all blacks im an all black 24 7 so ive got to realise that i cant be out at the wee small hours of the morning and doing what i was doing and thats probably come to my senses now
8033970 if i get those things corrected ill be a better man for it
8033971 its only been two months and i think this is the easy part its going to be later down the track when its six to nine months when things will get tough
8033972 you know its easy for me to sit here now and say im clean and i havent done this and i havent done that but its not that easy i am happy with where im at at the moment though
8033973 as i said im very fortunate rugbys probably been my saviour because i was pretty close to losing it at one stage
8033974 a major requirement of the hana financial group was to select a standards based authentication solution the actividentity mini token was selected as it complies with the oath open standard providing compatibility with 3rd party software and assurance of future proofing as industry requirements move over time
8033975 compliance with the fsa requirement means that we have to invest in the devices upfront we selected the actividentity mini token because it is a standards based solution combining competitive purchase cost no royalty based renewal cycle and longer battery life this provides hana financial group with the strongest return on investment
8033976 we have shown our commitment to our partners and customers by meeting their critical requirements of delivery timeline price competitiveness and product usability as an organization committed to supporting global industry standards we look forward to helping more organizations meet the fsa requirement in the future
8033977 the payment was made by me to assist funding the legal costs incurred personally by rt hon winston peters mp concerning his election petition dispute at his request
8033978 mr peters sought help from me for this purpose in a personal conversation some time after i had first met him in sydney
8033979 i agreed to help in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters i supported the labour party
8033980 some time after i had first met him in sydney
8033981 dear mr power i refer to your letter of 19 august 2008 concerning what i understand originated as a complaint made by mr rodney hide mp
8033982 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8033983 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8033984 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8033985 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8033986 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8033987 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8033988 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8033989 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8033990 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8033991 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8033992 the payment was made by me to assist funding the legal costs incurred personally by rt hon winston peters mp concerning his election petition dispute at his request

8033997 i had heard that the kiwi team had appealed to the ioc to strike another medal but i wasnt really expecting anything to come of it

8034001 the nature and severity of his risk eventually can be sufficiently contained within the community to justify a long term offender designation rather than a dangerous offender designation
8034002 je suis tr s d u de la r action du premier ministre charest

8034010 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
8034011 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
8034012 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
8034013 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
8034014 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
8034015 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
8034016 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed

8034019 promise the people of western new york that he wont take another vacation until congress passes a comprehensive american energy plan that includes off shore drilling
8034020 brian higgins is against off shore drilling so instead of working to find a compromise he voted to take a five week paid vacation
8034021 higgins made a serious mistake when he took a vacation instead of working to solve our energy crisis his irresponsible behavior hurt western new york families and businesses by unnecessarily keeping gas prices high all summer
8034022 off shore drilling will certainly achieve our mid term goal of foreign fuel independence it will also immediately solve our short term goal of lowering the price at the pump the moment that we pass a plan to increase the supply of oil through off shore drilling the market will react and the price of oil will go down
8034023 in july the people of western new york trusted brian higgins to make the right decision on his own but he took a vacation and let us down
8034024 apparently when it comes to his vacations we cant trust him to do the right thing on his own therefore we now must insist that he signs a pledge that he will not take another vacation until congress passes a comprehensive american energy plan that will provide immediate relief at the pump through off shore drilling
8034025 hold fast to the traditions you were taught either by an oral statement or by a letter of ours
8034026 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
8034027 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8034028 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abor tion
8034029 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
8034030 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8034031 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8034032 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8034033 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8034034 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8034035 when the criteria we use to assess someones ability to do a job is radically out of step with the actual demands of the job itself

8034043 my wife no question id hang out with her any time pause although if i must id say catriona rowntree pause but only because she enunciates well
8034044 im not the forgive and forget type but id bend the rules for johnny depp hes a bit of everything so imagine what he could do

8034055 a new letter has been sent to tom cruise business partner paula wagner and united artists in which we set out the facts of the case again and put a figure on the legal demands of our clients of us 11 million
8034056 the cost of making a game is so high that you need to recover it by selling a lot more units
8034057 you cant give up half the market by selling exclusives
8034058 its a trend were excited about but not completely surprised about if you look at the installed base and attached rate of customers to the xbox
8034059 third party publishers are looking at the same things we are and they want to put games into as many peoples hands as possible
8034060 the lack of a dominant console means its too difficult for software makers to give up on a console
8034061 with the ps3 or xbox 360 you dont have a clear winner like the playstation 2 or playstation were
8034062 the reality of exclusives is that they will become far more infrequent the way hardware companies have to offset that is through enhancing the quality of games coming through their own studios that will drive customers to buy their own hardware system
8034063 people were buying the xbox in anticipation of halo 3
8034064 restricts the manner in which any financial payments can be made
8034065 that would be exactly what i would say i hope youll give it a try if you havent i didnt think id like it since i usually have a hard time with non fiction it seems boring and slow this was nothing like that just pure beauty
8034066 adobe as a software company has to figure out a way to make money as we move to web 2 0 where everything is online and everything is free
8034067 theres lots of competition in this area so how can it take its franchise photoshop and turn it into something usable
8034068 whats happening is this capability photos and videos is coming within the reach of everyman
8034069 the tools making it accessible need to be put into place as well they need to broaden their products to appeal to wider markets that doesnt mean dumbing them down but hiding their complexity making the controls easier

8034153 homework for parent thread but thought this was the best place to start
8034154 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
8034155 are going to be bored because im going to give some back story that you know better than i do
8034156 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
8034157 now the story starts really in 1992 when this fuse was lit in georgia
8034158 now theres two territories theres abkhazia which has clearly defined administrative borders and theres south ossetia that doesnt before the troubles started abkhazia was an extremely ethnically mixed area about 60 percent georgian 20 percent abkhaz and 20 percent assorted others greeks estonians armenians jews what have you in ossetia it was a completely integrated and completely mixed ossetian georgian population the ossetians and the georgians have never been apart in the sense that they were living in their own little villages and doing their own little things there has been inter marriage and a sense of common understanding going back to distant history the georgians will tell you about king tamar thats a woman but they called her a king and she was married to an ossetian so the fuse was lit and two wars start one in abkhazia and one in south ossetia
8034159 it was also lit in tbilisi there was a guy in charge here zviad gamsakhurdia a little bit like serbian nationalist war criminal in bosnia radovan karadzic he was a poet he was an intellectual but he was one of these guys who veered off into ethnic exclusivism he made stupid declarations like georgia is only for the georgians if youre running a multi ethnic country that is really not a clever thing to say the central control of the state was extremely weak the russians were trying to make things worse there was a civil war between georgians and tbilisi but the key thing is that here there were militias georgian militias and some of them pretty nasty
8034160 this guy zviad gamsakhurdia was driven from power from across the street they bombed this place
8034161 theres a horrible picture in my georgia book of this facade
8034162 of course he led the government in exile until he came back in 1993 then died obscurely in the mountains of suicide some people say others say cancer then he was buried in grozny
8034163 things here explode and basically it gets pretty nasty thomas can tell you what happened
8034164 youve got two bits of abkhazia which are not ethnic abkhazia
8034165 the first thing that misha mikheil saakashvili did was try to poke his finger in russian president vladimir putins eyes as many times as possible
8034166 most notably by wanting to join nato the west in my view mishandled this situation america gave the wrong signals so did europe
8034167 but basically the encouragement was given despite stronger and stronger russian signals that a georgian accession to
8034168 just a little bit of back story again in july of 2007 russia withdrew from the conventional forces treaty in europe this is a soviet era treaty that dictates where
8034169 one provocation was to use the russian media to launch shrill accusations that the georgian army was in kodori preparing for an invasion of abkhazia now if you go up there i took a bunch of journalists up there a few times when you get to the actual checkpoint you have a wall of crumbling rock a wooden bridge another wall of crumbling rock a raging torrent and a steep mountainside filled with woods its not possible to invade out or invade in unless youve got air support which is why the abkhaz were never able to kick these georgians out they just kept that bit of territory
8034170 but this time im getting advice from an expert on how im doing
8034171 the next provocation on april 16 putin signs a presidential decree recognizing the documents of abkhazians and south ossetians in russia and vice versa
8034172 starting in mid july the russians launched the biggest military exercise in the north caucasus that theyve held since the chechnya war
8034173 on august 3 the head of the local administration says hes evacuating his civilians
8034174 on top of that for the last four years the russians have been dishing out passports to anyone who asks in those areas
8034175 so back to the 3rd of august kokoity announces women and children should leave as it later turned out he made all the civilians leave who were not fighting or did not have fighting capabilities on the same day irregulars ingush chechen ossetians and cossacks start coming in and spreading out into the countryside but dont do anything they just sit and wait on the 6th of august the shelling intensifies from ossetian positions and for the first time since the war finished in 1992 they are using 120mm guns
8034176 because of the peace agreement they had nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80mm okay so thats the formal start of the war it wasnt the attack on tskhinvali now stop me
8034177 all the reports ive read say saakashvili started the war
8034178 saakashvili is accused of starting this war on the 7th
8034179 but that sounds like complete bs to me if what you say is true
8034180 it must be stopped if not today then maybe tomorrow my troops were in our village avnevi on the 6th of august they blew up our troops four wheel drives our pickups they blew them up also in this village it was august 5th or 6th i cant remember they started bombing us with shells two soldiers died that day our peacekeepers the ossetians had a good position on the hill they could see all our positions and our villages and they started bombing they went to the top of the hill bombed us then went down we couldnt see who was shooting at us
8034181 but it started that day from that place when two georgians were killed
8034182 before they started bombing us they took all the civilians out of their villages
8034183 then they started damaging our villages houses a gas pipe roads yards they killed our animals they evacuated their villages then bombed our villages
8034184 but in another village i was fired upon on august 6th on the 5th of august they started shooting they blew up our peacekeeping trucks they put a bomb on the road and when they were driving they were blown up they also mined the roads used by civilians on the 6th of august they started bombing avnevi and at this time they took the civilians out of tskhinvali and sent them to north ossetia inside russia
8034185 they took the civilians kids women and put them on the bus and sent them to north ossetia
8034186 i was running away and the soldiers wounded me they robbed me and shot me in the leg with a kalashnikov i dont know if it was russians or ossetians they took my car took my gold chain and shot me
8034187 they didnt care if it was a house or a military camp
8034188 i saw it it was the russian military airplanes if they knew it was a georgian village they bombed all the houses many civilians were killed from this bombing
8034189 on the 6th while this is going on the integration minister who was until a few months ago an
8034190 on the evening of the 7th the ossetians launch an all out barrage focused on georgian
8034191 what they had in the area was peacekeeping stuff not stuff for fighting a war
8034192 the georgians will tell you that they estimate that these two actions together slowed the russian advance by 24 to 48 hours that is what the world considered to be mishas game and you know why the world considers it that because here in south ossetia was the head of the peacekeeping troops he hasnt been in iraq hes a peace keeper what have they been told for the last four years they lived in a failed state then there was the rose revolution it wasnt perfect but damn now theres electricity theres jobs roads have been fixed and what the georgians have had drummed into them is that georgia is now a constitutional state a state of law and order and everybody here knows that ossetia is a gangsters smugglers paradise the whole world knows it but here they know it particularly well the peacekeepers had a military objective and the first rule of warfare when youre talking to the media is not to reveal to your enemy what youre going to do so they werent going to blather into a microphone and say well actually im trying to go through tskhinvali in order to stop the russians so what did he say instead im here to restore constitutional order in south ossetia and thats it with that georgia lost the propaganda war and the world believes saakashvili started it and the rest of the story you know
8034193 this is your first time to the lands of the former soviet union
8034194 may sound just like a rhetorical flourish with no echo in the american mindset what it means in the post soviet mindset is what boris yeltsin was doing in chechnya this was the stupidest phrase this guy possibly could have used thats why people want to lynch him
8034195 your presentation was deliciously comprehensive perhaps it was well ask our new friend michael too much information out of the gate to absorb
8034196 there are some details that i would chip in who are the ossetians and where do they live this is the question that has been lost in all of the static from this story this autonomy south ossetia is an autonomous district as opposed to an autonomous republic with about 60 000 people max so where are the rest of the ossetians guess where they live tbilisi here there everywhere there are more ossetians take a look around this lobby you will find ossetians here of those ossetians who are theoretically citizens of the republic of georgia 60 000 live there and around 40 000 live here
8034197 are they on the side of those who live in south ossetia
8034198 one of them is georgias minister of defense georgia is a multi ethnic republic and the whole point of the ossetian ethnic question is this south ossetia is part of georgia
8034199 everyone regardless of nationality even those who love georgia genuinely thought saakashvili started it
8034200 absolutely weve been trying to tell the world about this for months if you go back and look at the archives youll see plenty of calls from the georgian government saying theyre really worried even some russian commentators agree that this is exactly what happened dont forget they sent in a lot of irregulars chechens cossacks ossetians ingush basically thugs not normal chechens or ingush thugs thugs out for a holiday many western camera crews were robbed at gunpoint ten meters from russian tanks while russian commanders just stood there smoking their cigarettes while the irregulars that happened to a turkish tv crew theyre lucky to still be alive some of the georgians were picked up by the irregulars if they happened to be female they got raped if they happened to be male they got shot immediately sometimes tortured injured people we have in hospitals who managed to get out have had arms chopped off eyes gouged out and their tongues ripped out
8034201 you also have to remember the propaganda campaign that came out
8034202 human rights watch is accusing the russian authorities of being indirectly responsible for the massive ethnic cleansing of georgians that happened in south ossetia
8034203 that goes on a lot where i usually work in the middle east
8034204 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
8034205 was pitting ethnic groups against one another they did this extremely skillfully in the sense that they never generated ethnic wars within their own territory

8034254 there were communities that took the lessons of the oil crisis in the 1970s seriously
8034255 portland started in 1979 and in 1993 we made a commitment to reduce our greenhouse gases and weve seen it make a difference
8034256 the future of this state should be the new energy economy
8034257 we can carve out energy security by carving out a diverse portfolio of energy options

8034259 the iphone application launch has been a tremendous catalyst for growth
8034260 because anyone can use limbo iphone users have triggered viral growth across all carriers mobile phone models and usage platforms
8034261 iphone application users are spurring greater interaction in the mobile community making it a richer and more enjoyable place for all limbo members regardless of how they participate be it through mobile web text commands internet or iphone application
8034262 i expect that the faa will feed the airline and then the airline will feed the information to me because communicating with all the airports is complicated
8034263 aside from the plane that is already delayed i still have two more to go out and six more to come in
8034264 we are experiencing an extremely turbulent time in the housing market millions of consumers are turning to trulia to make informed real estate decisions
8034265 at trulia our mission is to deliver unique local insight to consumers when they want it how they want it and where they want it todays launch is a big step in this direction
8034266 il va y avoir des retards et nimporte o car un seul tablissement g re d sormais les donn es de vol pour tout le monde
8034267 the state has now concluded that the riparian land adjoining the submerged land easement is owned by the city and that the original easement and all subsequent transfers and modifications granted by the state were made in error
8034268 shall not exclude or unreasonably interfere with the general public exercising public trust rights
8034269 but only to the extent determined by the company to be commercially practicable
8034270 we will move forward with what we planned to do all along
8034271 we personally never felt that it was a big issue
8034272 it was made a big issue by a few individuals
8034273 the higher resolution and larger screen size of iphone has enabled consumers to enjoy high fidelity video content on the go breaking free of the confines of the tv screens in a living room this exceptional on the go video viewing experience demands a quick and easy way to transfer video and or audio to the 3g iphone irecord pro fulfills this need
8034274 we are big fans of the mac experience so we realised there was huge scope to improve the experience small business owners were having inputting and analysing their financial information
8034275 were always on the lookout for cool new web apps and i find it quite funny that i am so excited about one that does accounting but i am
8034276 what i also like about xero is that it looks good not something that you immediately think of as necessary when doing your accounts but for me its so obvious the designers have thought about how people work and what they want to be able to look at all the headline data is there for me to see easily which is quite often all i want to know
8034277 the best way i can think to describe how happy i am with xero is i use it all the time from not even looking at the accounts side of the business i am now using xero all the time to run invoices look at the bank statements and all sorts of accounting things i never wanted to know about before and i am enjoying it
8034278 apple is quickly carving out its place in the enterprise the business world is recognizing the benefits of mac os x and now the powerful iphone technology
8034279 it administrators need to adapt to this new multiple os world and be ready to manage heterogeneous environments on a dime kace systems management appliances give administrators the tools they need to seamlessly and easily manage a range of enterprise platforms
8034280 todays dynamic workforces are increasingly becoming reliant on mobile devices like apples iphone to more effectively achieve organizational goals clearly kace understands the importance of simplifying and standardizing it management of mobile devices and has taken a bold leap in extending its kbox appliance solutions to address the growing popularity of the iphone
8034281 with this announcement kace reaffirms its commitment to provide broad heterogeneous support while not compromising on depth of functionality or cost effectiveness
8034282 after all everybody alive is going to use this today
8034283 with a little bit of effort you can make a difference do it one more time
8034284 you make dreams real for yourself and the community when you can do it just a little better
8034285 and maj dick burgin of the salvation army in kinston came driving up with food and with clothes i could put on my back and a billfold that had a few bucks in it that helped us live the next day and gave us faith
8034286 every little roll of paper you sell makes a difference
8034287 but instead of trying to get three in a row you are trying to get four in a square two players take turns placing pieces on an 8 by 8 board when a player gets four pieces at the corners of a square the square is drawn in and the player gets points squares may be any size or tipped at any angle bigger squares get more points
8034288 in the case that we are looking at today the dna analyst was subpoenaed in pulaski and in jefferson county and she would be able to testify in both courts without having to drive to both pine bluff and little rock
8034289 i would say its probably like maybe one or two packs of cigarettes over a lifetime
8034290 we dont consider it a problem but if it becomes a problem well take care of it
8034291 hey remember that terrible year from 2007 to 2008 when everything fell to crap and life was one big mess and nothing worked out and you had no money and you could not count on anything to happen correctly or easily and you see seemingly had no options and everything seemed dark and hopeless and then you got asked to work a temp job for peanuts at the british consulate in an attempt to make your first mortgage payment yeah those were the days where did i go wrong how i wish for those lovely days back again
8034292 as the demand for the first generation iphone in secondary markets remains strong we are able to offer higher dollar exchanges and remove the price issue from the decision to upgrade to a 3g iphone
8034293 were taking advantage of this unique spike in market values and passing the dollars back to consumers making the upgrade process as fast and easy as possible

8034297 the theme is that used by mozart for his piano variations ah vous dirai je maman
8034298 i think she will be supporting of obama because she understands what the causes are and what the issues are
8034299 in the end its all about the democratic party and the views that they all stand for in the end are still similar
8034300 in talking with the clinton supporters in the delegation there still some sense of intense disappointment i havent heard anyone say they arent going to stop obama when its all done but they were really looking forward to being clinton supporting delegates and nominating for the first time a female candidate for president
8034301 i was not part of the contest but did it just to prove that i come from a land of valour i am a coorgi or kodava we are known to be a martial race
8034302 i respect ram gopal varma but i think he should not throw such challenges if the movie was really scary the censor board would have objected i dont believe in black magic but to watch the film in a 227 seat theatre alone is quite an achievement
8034303 he was at a shoot and he asked me why i was doing it why i had booked the entire show for rs 47 500 i told him i am a kodava and dont get scared easily
8034304 she and a few friends were relieved to see me when i came out but i think nobody should try this stunt as its not only expensive but also foolish
8034305 sir dont dare anyone for anything its like questioning someones integrity
8034306 what weve found so far is merely the tip of the iceberg
8034307 managed properly canadas share of this incredible endowment will fuel the prosperity of our country for generations and geo mapping will pave the way for the resource development of the future
8034308 what weve found so far is merely the tip of the iceberg
8034309 managed properly canadas share of this incredible endowment will fuel the prosperity of our country for generations and geo mapping will pave the way for the resource development of the future
8034310 these times are challenging and we can reasonably expect them to remain challenging for the near future
8034311 bmo was quite a disappointment it was quite a bit lower than the targets
8034312 the news here is that lowered expectations should be thought of as the norm
8034313 scotia did better than bmo and thats part and parcel of the fact that they have very limited u s operations
8034314 there are challenging results out of the u s and i think the market rewards scotia for not playing in that pool
8034315 the other banks will have higher provisions for credit losses too but i think this is very specific to bmo because its fairway thats causing the problem here
8034316 people are really going to be watching whats happening on the domestic side
8034317 this marks a noticeable deceleration versus the strong 9 5 percent growth rate posted last quarter and supports our view that the flagship franchises of the canadian banks are in for a period of softer growth given the pressure on the top line
8034318 we knew the usa were going to be tough up front but in the second half we came over top of them
8034319 the first half we played to our plan and then made the adjustments for the win
8034320 we knew we had one opportunity to redeem ourselves it was to beat the usa and not go home with two losses we did that and we are really pleased
8034321 man my css didnt work in ie7 got majorly skitchslapped for it
8034322 in light of these views we are ready with our 70 deputies to assess and contribute to amendments that would be prepared with the widest possible consensus in parliament
8034323 the justice ministry figures just cover the number of individuals who applied to judicial bodies complaining they were subjected to torture however there are many others who dont apply to judicial bodies out of fear that they may be punished for a second time for this reason we estimate that the number of people subjected to torture is at least three or four times larger than the figures stated by the ministry
8034324 torture doesnt distinguish between women men the elderly or children those who are implicated in burglary and theft and whose ideological affiliations are not appreciated by security officials are subjected to torture the most what we should do for an effective fight against torture is to change the peoples point of view toward it
8034325 civil servants who are accused of maltreating individuals are not punished or removed from office there is no serious sanction against them they escape without any punishment lawsuits filed against civil servants take long years to reach a conclusion
8034326 as the association we have an active role in the fight against torture and ill treatment id like to underline one point here there is a significant difference between point of view and the turkish peoples point of view regarding torture for us the slightest verbal and physical attack an individual is subjected to should be considered torture however our people believe torture is an act by which severe pain or suffering is inflicted on a person

8034331 at the request of the georgian government these ships will be delivering humanitarian aid to poti
8034332 the uss mcfaul and another us ship will dock in poti on wednesday
8034333 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8034334 the fact that there are western warships in the black sea cannot but be a cause for concern they include two us warships one each from spain and poland and four from turkey
8034335 russia is not blaming turkey for the situation in the black sea the situation is not related to turkey we are asking why the us wants to deliver humanitarian aid via warships and why it doesnt prefer an airlift which is shorter weve been worried about this
8034336 we find turkeys manner compatible with the montreux convention and appreciate it
8034337 we can confirm that us ship borne humanitarian aid will be delivered to poti tomorrow
8034338 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8034339 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8034340 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8034341 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
8034342 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8034343 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
8034344 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted
8034345 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
8034346 the fact that the president signed the recognition of the independence of both territories is an irreversible act
8034347 i think this is an indication that russia has opted for further aggravation in relations with the west and a very serious rift this time
8034348 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8034349 it does nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
8034350 j tem killed okkan not hizbullah because j tem was able to do anything it wanted in diyarbak r before okkan was appointed their commander zahit engin was free to act in any way he wanted j tem had connections and sometimes they attacked or murdered people
8034351 isnt that unbelievable interestingly the attackers not only opened fire on a police chief from a distance they also approached his car and shot him in the head then they disappeared into the streets of diyarbak r the media and others said the murder was hizbullahs work but this was not believable because hizbullah had neither the power nor the brains to carry out such an attack furthermore it could have taken responsibility for the assassination but it didnt
8034352 however not even one person was found despite all efforts but who committed that crime i remember comments at the time similar to those made about the assassinations of u ur mumcu and abdi pek i prominent journalists the murder was the job of the state within the state referring to j tem and counter guerillas in other words it was the job of some powers who have fears about democratization and transparency
8034353 they gave us new civilian clothing from the budget of the governor and smith and wesson guns i had a temporary post at j tem in urfa when i was in urfa col veli k k also arrested as part of ergenekon investigation came to inspect our unit his was in civilian clothes and had a big moustache i dont know what other purposes he had in urfa i dont think he would just inspect a small unit
8034354 specifically to appeal to teens who arent keen on reading
8034355 the crew stopped off at the chicken shop zee was there hes older runs with a different crew but were cool i stayed back chilling with zee i figured if i stayed out long enough alex would be in bed when i got back me and zee talked on a level for ages a police car slid past we touched fists and went our separate ways
8034356 was not helpful with regards to peace and security in the area
8034357 a rotating bright unusual ode to those of us who cant get enough vinegar or crunch on one visit it includes pickled pencils of asparagus prunes that taste of cloves little rounds that look like chickpeas but turn out to be taut plumped golden raisins a single farm stand carrot petite cornichons and even a green pepper
8034358 its obviously very different from just cooking pickles for the restaurant
8034359 it has to be far more consistent no experimenting whats on the label is what it is the first few times i did it on my own to get down an actual recipe
8034360 i didnt want to have to train someone on basic canning principles and my mom lives on camano island and shes great and would pretty much do anything for me
8034361 if i get a lot of people wanting to buy them theres no way ill be able to keep up with pickling
8034362 unfortunately its the logical thing to do because someone is set up with the facilities and can buy jars at half the cost you can and buy sugar at half the cost you can its not as romantic thats for sure but unfortunately i think its a reality
8034363 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
8034364 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
8034365 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
8034366 is the only guarantee to achieve permanent security and peace in the middle east
8034367 adopt dialogue and diplomacy as the only ways to solve conflicts
8034368 the talks far from playing any positive role for israel are mistaken both in terms of our values and in terms of our practical interest
8034369 i think its no secret and i have said it to my israeli counterparts that i dont think that settlement activity is helpful
8034370 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8034371 the peace process is not and should not be affected by any kind of settlement activities
8034372 i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together
8034373 i set out on my journey in the pacific ocean in july 2007 and stayed at sea for 312 days i was not accompanied by anyone the record previously belonged to peter bird who spent 304 days at sea
8034374 my adventure on the pacific was full of hard times when i ran out of the foodstuffs i brought with me i asked for help from fishermen they gave me some fish then i ate the fish and calamari i caught i also drank rain water i struggled against heavy rain and storms to stay alive i had very difficult times but finally broke the world record
8034375 the first few weeks i spent at sea were full of hardships i was very careful not to get sick i was especially afraid of contracting an infection to avoid this i paid great attention to personal hygiene i was careful not to get injured all i needed to do was be careful in time i got used to being on alert against injuries and illnesses
8034376 it was discovered that there were multiple null pointed function de references in the linux kernel terminal handling code
8034377 a local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code as root or crash the system leading to a denial of service
8034378 when theyre fresh off the tree the best thing to do is just cut them up and put them in salads
8034379 anything thats mushy well make a fig preserve like a jam to put with the loukoumades fried doughnuts or ice cream
8034380 at the farmers market table theyve got a table life of about the first 10 minutes of the market
8034381 the first customers in line when the bell rings will delightedly scoop them up there and gone
8034382 theyre certainly not the easiest tree fruit to grow commercially
8034383 id like to carry the fresh figs all year long
8034384 such great destruction is being carried out that certain seljuk gravesites and bridges are now beyond restoration
8034385 very few people who treasure hunt in our country do so under the observation of experts these illegal treasure hunters work day and night destroying our architectural wonders
8034386 there is also a difference between those who are actually digging for treasure and those who are organizing this business those who dig are generally people experiencing economic problems and people who are looking for a way out as for those who organize the digging they are generally mafia like organizations or gangs in fact they are organizations in which even some well known people are involved actually treasure hunting is an extremely ancient phenomenon the hittites even had laws describing how treasure hunters were to be punished
8034387 the people that compose this second group are similar to gambling addicts they enter into this business excited about making quick and easy money they tend to love games of chance and when they are not hunting treasures or talking about treasure hunting they feel empty these are people for whom the process itself is a pleasure it doesnt matter whether or not they actually find anything
8034388 our dear prophet said there is nothing better than the labor of the hand
8034389 the fear is given our track record that the sailing will not be so smooth
8034390 we may return to the hoary days of the past which discredited the political class as a whole and prepared the ground for an extra constitutional intervention
8034391 this is a threat that looms over our heads permanently
8034392 the us postponed the process of delisting the north as a state sponsor of terrorism
8034393 now that the us breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
8034394 its regrettable that this announcement came at a time when each side has been trying
8034395 i hope north korea will resume disablement measures at an early date
8034396 japan will continue to work closely with the six way nations and make efforts so that north korea will resume nuclear disablement work
8034397 troubleshoots recovery efforts among federal state and local officials in new orleans and across the gulf coast
8034398 im basically asking blakely whos probably getting paid a whole hell of a lot more money than i am to do his damn job
8034399 there has not been the level of visible accomplishment that we would like in our neighborhoods
8034400 i want to be sure im hammering home the importance of that ballot measure
8034401 i want to fight rampage real badly i actually think i match up very well against him but ive managed to lose to him twice now
8034402 but the third fight will not have anything to do with the first two it will be a fresh start rampage is the one fight i really want as much as i want my title back
8034403 hes lost the belt now so i cant beat him and win the title back in one fight but i want to fight him just as bad as when he was champion
8034404 the script that weve written essentially covers all six if it was at the level of harry potter we might be able to talk about doing six films but in this case our film is very much an adaptation of the entire six
8034405 were hopefully going into production later this year weve been doing a lot of work on it in a conception level and getting into casting and crew and stuff
8034406 i think all of these groups there should be transparency and freedoms watch is no exception although i suspect that if there is disclosure it would be 99 percent adelson and the rest would be others
8034407 in talking with the clinton supporters in the delegation there still some sense of intense disappointment i havent heard anyone say they arent going to stop obama when its all done but they were really looking forward to being clinton supporting delegates and nominating for the first time a female candidate for president

8034416 over the last eight years youve been falling behind over the last eight years your lives are less secure over the last eight years you are more likely to have lost your health insurance over the last eight years you are more likely to not be able to save over the last eight years your home values have started to drop
8034417 thats the track record those are the facts and john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did so if you think that the last eight years have been good then you need to go ahead and vote for john mccain
8034418 there has been a massive shift of income from the bottom and middle to the top the richest 1 percent of americans have increased their share of the nations income to a higher level than any year since 1928 the eve of the great depression

8034424 we are delighted to announce that all of the 14 buildings will be ready by september
8034425 our 10 year plan for replacing our student housing has become a six month plan construction has proceeded ahead of schedule and we are grateful to god for providing for us in this way it is truly overwhelming to think about where we were on feb 6 and where we are now
8034426 this is highly unusual to complete a project of this magnitude as quickly as we have
8034427 as i sit back and analyze whats happened i think unions need is what motivated the response everybody has had a total commitment and a passion to make sure that the job was completed by sept 1
8034428 i think that people have a lot greater appreciation for each other and even for the material things
8034429 i think there will be an attitude of thankfulness and rejoicing
8034430 we wanted to find a way to be a part of this event in a non political way
8034431 this grew to something far beyond what we ever envisioned it would be
8034432 when we started serving this past saturday some of the officers were still a little hesitant about us they thought we were hired caterers

8034445 meena was kept waiting for three hours and then told by the leader of the opposition partha chatterjee that the blockade would be on because of the state governments denial of justice to singur farmers raj kanojia ig law and order said
8034446 over 20 000 trucks carrying perishable items like vegetables fruits and fish are unable to reach the city
8034447 nearly 80 000 drivers and cleaners in 20 000 trucks have been spending sleepless nights without food and water on the road since august 24 we will incur a loss of rs 200 crore as goods in the trucks have already perished

8034484 oh boo hoo you women dont have a clue what its like to feel real pain
8034485 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8034486 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8034487 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8034488 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8034489 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8034490 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8034491 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8034492 you see the kids needed help they were stuck under the tables i just reacted
8034493 once the shooting started they students all jammed underneath the tables and they just froze under there and they were yelling
8034494 i just got under there and just helped with the evacuation and i stayed on until he shot himself
8034495 they really are playing with fire on this one literally
8034496 there is much more traffic out there and yet the road hasnt changed in 25 years
8034497 we want to make sure its safe for everyone including the motoring public
8034498 everyone here is an expert at something and they all have an important role to play
8034499 all the opposition parties are clear they will not support this government going to october 2009
8034500 in the lack of certainty about an election date it falls to the government to create that certainty
8034501 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
8034502 its not a matter of polls as you know the polls arent particularly wonderful
8034503 its a matter of my responsibility as prime minister to make a decision on whether i think the fall session of parliament can be productive certainly spending weeks and weeks playing telephone tag with guys to set up the meetings with opposition leaders doesnt help me confirm that things are going to be very productive
8034504 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in a space of a few weeks
8034505 this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to call an election and break his word
8034506 i did not take long leave as planned because i was feeling strong enough and wanted to return to work at the earliest but then this incident comes up i did not feel safe in singur given my past incident therefore i went home to haldia i hope to return by the end of this week when i expect things to turn normal i want to get back to work
8034507 on my return i saw a marked improvement in security arrangements
8034508 there are announcements on the loudspeaker near the station urging outsiders to leave singur one does not feel comfortable and at home in such an environment
8034509 sengupta might be given drinking water and sanitation and other departments held by choudhary
8034510 there is a possibility of some changes in the portfolios of the ministers
8034511 tomorrow i and my cabinet colleagues will be taking the oath of office and secrecy at morabadi grounds if a few among them are unable to take oath tomorrow they will be doing so later everything will be set right soon
8034512 first i will dig the earth then sow he said while taking about his future plans
8034513 i worked hard i did my job but the boys at twitter are just as churlish as the boys at sterling cooper such a pity theyre so petty
8034514 its legal maneuvering may go down as the single worst use misuse of social media
8034515 it was a somalia like situation with people young and old pushing and pulling each other for the packets the way the packets were thrown from the truck triggered the incident
8034516 the prime minister who was scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the university will do so in a few months he also assured us that he would enhance the btc package from rs 500 crore to another rs 300 crore for three years
8034517 didi should have agreed to buddhadeb bhattacharjees talks proposal she made a mistake there is no harm in holding talks
8034518 if the government comes up with a constructive proposal i can agree to it we have to survive and the government has to ensure it
8034519 the family will starve if we dont work theres no point wasting a days wages but i did go on the first day
8034520 if the government can provide a job for my son we can think about its proposal how long can we live in uncertainty
8034521 the government should understand that land is an emotional issue for us my husband refused to step out of his room for days after our plot was acquired
8034522 the chief minister and his government are arrogant we are suffering because of an ego clash between the two leaders
8034523 earlier we tilled our land and had enough grain for our family to last a year now we have to work on others land
8034524 i want my plot back the government and the opposition should think about our interests
8034525 personally if you ask me i think it strike is not helping us our country but unfortunately as i belong to one party and when they call a strike i keep mum but i have finally decided that next time i will open my mouth
8034526 we are also trying our best to change the mindset of union leaders and workers i think things have changed i assure you gherao will never return to our state i will not allow that i think it is highly illegal and immoral
8034527 whatever he said was his personal opinion which is different from the partys position citu considers bandhs the working classs ultimate weapon we have achieved the right to strike through a long struggle
8034528 we dont know why he said what he did and under what circumstances but it is the standard practice in our party to air personal views in proper forums of the party and go by its collective decision
8034529 had admitted his mistake after making comments about party matters in public
8034530 may face opposition if he spoke in the cpm against the right to bandh on just causes
8034531 buddhababu got elected on a cpm ticket and became chief minister how could he say he does not support bandhs but is forced to join when his party calls them
8034532 last weapon of protest when there is no response from the government on an issue

8034537 they say that the shoulder blades are where your wings were when you
8034538 we for a long time have been saying the future of the town is to transform it into a place where people will come and stay for two or three days not just come and play in the casino for a few hours
8034539 every performance needs a little blood i look forward to seeing the fighters get roughed up a bit
8034540 wait arent your thighs supposed to be bigger than you calves
8034541 you are a splendid butterfly it is your wings that make you beautiful and i could make you pay and pay but i could never make you stay not for all the tea in china not if i could sing like a bird not for all north carolina not for all my little words not if i could write for you the sweetest song you ever heard it doesnt matter what i do not for all my little words
8034542 so many people i know dont even know this is happening
8034543 some of our older firefighters are starting to retire and we have the younger ones in here
8034544 were trying to establish without having to go out to as many fires as we used to some type of experience that they can rely on

8034547 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8034548 well with the golf course the way it was it was a beautiful area well used you know with the lake there and everything right now were kind of blocked from all of the eye sore that we see
8034549 its very discouraging that its just sitting there all tore up and nothing is being done that we can see or hear
8034550 this is kind of a bad thing a lot of people are very disappointed with the way this was handled theyre very disappointed that now it just sits there and now its a big eyesore for the whole city
8034551 its just basically a wait and see what happens nothing can be done until like weve been told the middle of december
8034552 just isnt on the short term radar as an anticipated market for us

8034554 after the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia unavoidable conflict awaits the russian federation and the west
8034555 the first a new full scale confrontation of the west and russia indications of which will be natos map being offered to georgia and ukraine and also exclusion in one form or another of moscow from the g8
8034556 in the event of the final break up of russian western relations they will lose everything
8034557 but the west will lose more because russia will cease to support them on iran north korea and afghanistan therefore i do not believe the west will decide on large scale confrontation
8034558 as for russia putin and medvedev have nowhere to step back to either they will make russia a powerful and flourishing power or they will go the way of milosevic
8034559 lehman brothers holdings inc may set up a company funded by outside investors to buy some of its mortgage assets aiming to dispel concern the firm faces crippling losses people familiar with the discussions said
8034560 our read lehman wants to move its toxic real estate holdings into a minority owned off balance sheet vehicle to offload the troubles would be nice wouldnt it except to do such a deal theyll probably have to retain the lions share of the loss exposure unless theyre lucky enough to tap into a shrinking pool of greater fools
8034561 to bring jesus christ to all people strengthen their faith and prepare them for ministry
8034562 i suppose that is possible at any time whether you are entering a competition or not unfortunately in the world it seems today we are not safe no matter what we do
8034563 my fellow delegates tonight we turn the page on eight years of debt division and an economy in decline we turn the page on a republican administration that has failed to bring americans together to meet the challenges of an uncertain century
8034564 a republican administration that saw the deadliest attack ever sustained on american soil and called americans not to serve but to shop
8034565 a republican administration that inherited a projected surplus of 5 6 trillion economic policies that created 22 million jobs a foreign policy that deserved and earned respect around the world and squandered all of it in an historic failure of leadership
8034566 eight years later what do they have to show for it
8034567 we all know this even john mccain concedes that we are worse off than we were four years ago but you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8034568 no we cant afford more of the same we need new leadership we need change its time to elect barack obama president of the united states
8034569 americans have been asking for change since november 2006 and we democrats are heeding the call we democrats have been fighting every day for working people and their families
8034570 weve raised the minimum wage and put the focus back on hard working americans
8034571 weve passed an energy bill to make our cars more efficient and our conservation more effective
8034572 were supporting alternative fuels to free us from the tyranny of dependence on foreign oil
8034573 we passed a new gi bill to honor the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform
8034574 and every day we strive to honor a principle familiar to every american family we wont spend more money than we have
8034575 i am proud of all of those accomplishments but the truth is that the republicans in the white house and in the senate have stopped real change
8034576 americans want a single minded focus on terrorists defeat and al qaedas total destruction not decades of american troops in baghdad
8034577 americans are tired of country club economics we want an economy that works for all of us for people who are struggling to own just one home much less seven
8034578 americans want clean energy and lower gas prices not subsidies for oil companies making record profits
8034579 and americans want affordable healthcare for their children and their families
8034580 but we wont get the change we need with john mccain in the white house we can we must do better
8034581 with your hard work on january 20th barack obama will stand on the steps of the capitol and take the oath of office
8034582 senator obama has reminded us these are the soul trying times our forbearers spoke of when the ease of complacency and self interest must give way
8034583 we democrats pledge ourselves to that cause to turn the page on the past and give the american story new meaning in this soul trying new century
8034584 when dawn breaks on january 21st we will begin the long tough essential job before us bringing america the change we need
8034585 and here in denver we ask a man of character intellect compassion vision and achievement to lead that change
8034586 that is what we must do to renew the promise of our great nation
8034587 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8034588 yes you can look at that last minute penalty but discipline is also a big part of the game
8034589 you dont abuse the referees if you want to keep them in the game
8034590 we focussed all week on discipline and if you look at the penalty count thats what happened i think what terry clune kia ora captain said about having experienced players was true discipline was a factor
8034591 its a pity we havent seen both sides play in excellent conditions this season
8034592 both teams played the best that they could in the slippery conditions
8034593 i dont only speak for myself when i say that we the students the staff you know humans have had enough of your rampant transportational bitchery
8034594 there i am at 4 56pm getting on a bus labelled a 12 hoping in vain it will turn out to be a 12 for real even though i know its almost certainly one of your wacky pranks
8034595 im happy to write a letter which says the language and the tone i took could have been more carefully moderated
8034596 i could have been much more diplomatic about the way i approached it
8034597 there were some concerns that obviously needed looking at and addressing
8034598 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8034599 its important that this report is done well and that this is done in a way that brings value to a broad group of stakeholders public police and policy makers
8034600 the issue is not so much the tool as the rhetoric that revolves around it
8034601 in my experience that particular device has saved many lives
8034602 it felt like i was waking for the national championship game again

8034607 every square represents at least one organ transplant and one life saved
8034608 it was her wish and we knew that she would be able to help others in that way
8034609 the sooner we know what a patients wishes are the sooner we can make that miracle happen in someone elses life

8034615 were probably not going to hear a lot about fiscal responsibility in the next 10 weeks
8034616 over time people are going to have to assume more personal responsibility for their own future except for those who are poor
8034617 both of them have to get real you cant promise those things without putting them in a larger context about how its going to affect the future and how we solve these problems and thats what weve been trying to get both camps to focus on
8034618 an arc of crisis stretches along the shores of the indian ocean with fragile social and political structures in a region of vital importance to us threatened with fragmentation the resulting political chaos could well be filled by elements hostile to our values and sympathetic to our adversaries
8034619 i did not know it then perhaps i did not want to know but it is clear to me now that the americans wanted me out clearly this is what the human rights advocates in the state department wanted what was i to make of the administrations sudden decision to call former under secretary of state george ball to the white house as an adviser on iran ball was among those americans who wanted to abandon me and ultimately my country
8034620 regret what that secret operation was an excellent idea it had the effect of drawing the russians into the afghan trap and you want me to regret it the day that the soviets officially crossed the border i wrote to president carter we now have the opportunity of giving to the ussr its vietnam war
8034621 what is most important to the history of the world the taliban or the collapse of the soviet empire some stirred up muslims or the liberation of central europe and the end of the cold war
8034622 nonsense it is said that the west had a global policy in regard to islam that is stupid there isnt a global islam
8034623 all the stuff theyve taken is the hardest to replace
8034624 theyve all got special memories attached to them of course
8034625 i really would love to have them back anonymously would be wonderful

8034640 we check for this quite a bit when we go into hazardous atmospheres its one of the gases we check for because it can cause great respiratory distress
8034641 i think it was only 38 minutes from the time the first call came in til we actually deployed our staff with our decontamination trailer and had the tent set up and started running the first patient through
8034642 theres a little bit of a delay because were just another call coming in and theyre not as prioritized
8034643 if somebody sees you walking through the park and they have a spray can they may not graffiti something because youre there
8034644 it will give them much better coverage around the city which is essentially what the system is designed to do
8034645 seeing things and hearing them and reporting them immediately while theyre happening is the most important thing for them to do and its a valuable asset to the community and to our department
8034646 it just gives you an extra eye and ear to have through the neighborhood and it does thwart crime

8034704 as i was leaving the bathroom i saw two or three people at the front door escaping i dont know who they were my husband was lying in a pool of blood in our bed
8034705 i thought he was a really cool person and this was way before he was even a presidential candidate and i liked him a lot
8034706 he invited me to washington and i went we talked about boxing were both boxing fanatics and when i talked to him i never felt beneath him he looks directly at me when hes speaking to me and we have the same level of respect for each other
8034707 he said yankee i was a soldier and i saw people die next to me latinos who never got their citizenship but who were willing to die for this country i saw a hernandez i saw a rodriguez how they killed them

8034727 biologists of all stripes acknowledge an amazing ability of various plants and animals to adapt to specialized niches for example scientists have recently discovered a new species wholly unrelated to any previously known species which survives on the lips of one particular type of lobster morris 1995 although this form of evolution is remarkable it also leaves the creatures vulnerable to even a slight change in the environment the same specialization that made these creatures so dependent on the success of a relatively small group of lobsters makes them less adaptable to relatively small changes in the global environment for example this particular group of lobsters may decline or migrate to a less desirable location threatening the existence of their tiny lip dwellers
8034728 the price of sawdust has soared since 2006 up from about 25 a ton to more than 100 in some markets blame the housing slump fewer new homes mean fewer trees cut for use in construction which leads to less sawdust and other wood waste driving up the price
8034729 farms use sawdust and wood shavings as cozy and clean bedding for horses and chickens
8034730 wineries use oak sawdust as a flavoring agent for some wines perdue farms which raises broiler chickens goes through seven million cubic feet of wood shavings a year oil rig operators in wyoming and colorado pour sawdust into the caverns they find deep inside rock formations as they hunt for pools of petroleum sawdust gives drill bits something to grind through
8034731 the housing slump has devastated sawmill production across the country
8034732 we know that if we get 10 percent of the republican vote if we get 50 percent of the independents and we get 75 percent of the democrats in the state mitch mcconnell cannot win
8034733 we have not seen one poll where we didnt exceed 10 percent of the republicans that we didnt get 50 percent of independents
8034734 its time for democrats to bring back home that crossover democrat
8034735 its important that everyone in this room give them the truth and the truth of where their future lies if they dont change now from mitch mcconnell to the democratic agenda which is today americas agenda

8034739 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog

8034754 senator mcconnell has enjoyed working with congressman chandler on key issues and looks forward to continuing that bipartisan relationship over the next six years
8034755 we think congressman chandler showed particularly good judgment when he said that senator mcconnells leadership was essential as they worked together on obtaining funding for kentucky state university and that he appreciated senator mcconnells ongoing leadership in cleaning up the chemical weapons stored at the bluegrass army depot
8034756 senator mcconnell looks forward to six more years of fostering bipartisan relationships that move kentucky and our nation forward
8034757 i was elected by over 84 000 democrats in western kentucky to represent hillary clinton and if her name is on the ballot that is what i plan to do

8034760 union workers vote democrat most of the time because they have somebody talking to them that theyve worked with for 15 years that reminds them why its important to vote democrat that is what this plan is modeled after
8034761 people dont vote democrat because their union leaders tell them to they vote democrat because the guy on the shop floor is someone they know
8034762 registering to vote is not enough not only do you make sure they vote but almost every state has a provision for early voting that is crticial because you know very well what is going to be underneath somebodys windshield wipers the sunday before an election

8034780 i have no doubt that the duty of myself at this time is to be the leader if the party will have me because i think we cannot have a vacuum at the top
8034781 our meditations have given us confidence to stand such a shock
8034782 there is no such thing as death only in the physical sense we know he is ok now he will return because he was striving for happiness and desired bliss so much
8034783 he has been unwell for some months the reason for his death is at present unknown but there were no untoward circumstances associated with it
8034784 so first ive analyzed the languages which are wide spread now sign in before you can post messages
8034785 there should be a simple easily implementable kernel to the lisp that kernel should be both more than scheme modules and macros and less than scheme continuations remain an ugly stain on the otherwise clean manuscript of scheme the kernel should emphasize implementational simplicity but not at the expense of interface simplicity where one conflicts with the other the capability should be left out of the kernel one reason is so that the kernel can serve as an extension language for other systems much as gnu emacs uses a version of lisp for defining emacs macros

8034788 i had a really good day last thursday in toronto and then i woke up the next morning and it felt terrible
8034789 its better its not as stiff moving around there are signs that were going in the right direction but maybe you dont want to go out there and swing right yet and blow something up again
8034790 that was one of the reasons we got the mri to see why its kind of lingering and hanging around vs kind of going away i did it in japan and it stuck around for two or three days and was gone this one has been kind of relentless for a little over a week
8034791 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8034792 i really love my life now its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize ive got a great home at fox now and i think its where i belong i wish i couldve had different news for giants fans but ive known for a while im done
8034793 here is a kid that tears the achilles and makes the catch
8034794 barack is a fine person but i dont think hes ready to be president
8034795 well be monitoring every word that comes from the podium looking factual inaccuracies responding with whats appropriate
8034796 its important because you cant let a news cycle much less an hour or two hours go with an attack that is a distortion of your candidates record
8034797 reporters are now not writing for the next day theyre writing for the next hour the next two hours because they have blogs that need to be updated and theyre going on tv theyre doing radio interviews
8034798 the guy retired after 15 years in the league on top and he moved on in his career already
8034799 hes planning for his future it aint like brett favre these are two different scenarios brett favre didnt even try to find another job he was out there throwing to high school kids strahan hasnt hes been doing his fox thing
8034800 thats tough i have never done it personally but watching guys try to turn it back on its been a struggle for them
8034801 but michael strahans a different breed hes a hall of famer hes a guy who obviously didnt come to training camp and didnt do nothing last year either and put up a pro bowl season if there is somebody that can do it he can probably do it but i dont know if its in his best interests

8034807 i condemn russias decision to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia as independent states and call upon all countries of the world not to accord any legitimacy to this action
8034808 moscows action deserves condemnation from the entire international community and russia must understand that its violations of international law carry consequences
8034809 todays decision the culmination of a long effort aimed at splitting these two regions away from georgia represents a major step forward in that process
8034810 note to self listerine is for mouthwash not for repelling mosquitoes
8034811 the more the mosquitoes get a chance to bite me

8034813 id say generally implementing the village green project up there and other development projects to ease the tax burden on the homeowner
8034814 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8034815 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8034816 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8034817 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8034818 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8034819 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8034820 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8034821 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8034822 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8034823 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8034824 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8034825 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8034826 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8034827 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8034828 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8034829 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8034830 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that is really much more difficult than it once was
8034831 i dont believe in the use of for other things
8034832 i just dont want it to open up with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8034833 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8034834 what well obviously do is look at it after the were hopeful that were going to say it was great

8034843 i think each and every member state is very clear that it is of the utmost importance to find a common position and i am going to do whatever i can so that we succeed
8034844 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8034845 this a challenge to the entire world not just georgia
8034846 the point here is the russians are bluffing and theyre overplaying their hand
8034847 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8034848 the ball is in the europeans court if they want a worsening in relations they will get it of course
8034849 if they want to maintain strategic relations which is in my opinion totally in the interests of russia and europe everything will go well
8034850 it was to be expected that the leipzig trade fair would try to keep the topic in its 2009 programme as well by announcing its date but they will have to do it without the industry for the most part the lead trade fair will take place in cologne in 2009 and beyond
8034851 from leipzig we are bringing the clear message that the games industry will be exhibiting in 2009 in cologne at gamescom we have met with broad approval and the industry is looking forward to gathering in cologne whatever happens in germany in 2009 outside of cologne cannot claim to represent this sector
8034852 the trade visitors area in halls 4 and 5 at the cologne exhibition centre is the new communication and trading platform for the international games industry
8034853 designed as a compact unit the area offers the participants from trade and industry media and development optimal conditions that will allow them to enter into dialogue with one another
8034854 i sit at my desk until i get a call
8034855 we used to have a good tradition in olympic hockey but we failed to qualify for the last two editions of the games
8034856 i believe that we still have potential in this sport we will seriously look into this sport to find out what had really gone wrong
8034857 i consider this as the best ever olympics for malaysia because we were not dependent only on one sport badminton archery and cycling showed a lot of promise and they are definitely closing in on the world class athletes
8034858 the only setback for us was the lack of mental strength showed by several athletes this will be an aspect that we will continue to work on as we prepare for the next olympics
8034859 unlike before we do not plan to waste time we will not wait until after the the 2010 asian games in guangzhou or commonwealth games in new delhi
8034860 by early next year we will launch our programmes for the 2012 olympics it will be a solid four year programme and our focus will be on quality rather than quantity
8034861 from now until end of this year we will review these four sports badminton archery cycling and hockey we will discard the deadwood and earmark the potential talent
8034862 there will be plenty of international stints competition for the athletes over the next four years good incentives deals will be prepared for them
8034863 the bam badminton association of malaysia still do not have mixed doubles specialists this is an event that we can fight for at the next olympics womens weightlifting is also an area for us to explore
8034864 with more resources and amazons expertise in building a platform where people come to share ideas there are a lot of new opportunities in the future that will benefit each of you

8034870 although these areas werent designed to protect against bleaching there is an expectation that they will protect an assemblage of fish fauna which will hopefully assist the reef to recover
8034871 the currents are probably flushing the reefs and removing any excess sediment which can discourage coral from settling
8034872 advanced wastewater and storm water treatment reduction of sedimentation and runoff from agricultural areas and no discharge zones for boater sewage are all ways to ensure that corals can survive

8034889 what low and middle income californians gained in 2006 they began to lose in 2007 and theyre likely to continue to lose in 2008
8034890 the current downturn points to the importance of having a strong safety net in place for families to rely on during tough economic times
8034891 nationally significant declines in private coverage in both employer based and individually purchased plans were offset by public programs picking up coverage but unlike the nation as a whole which has a small decrease in uninsured the californias rate of uninsured inched up to 18 6
8034892 californians are more likely to be uninsured than residents of all but six states our public programs are valiantly trying to pick up the slack from the erosion of private coverage by employers and individuals but now this budget crisis threatens to make severe cuts in the public programs that are the last hope for so many californians
8034893 we need to be expanding these successful public coverage programs now not cutting them at exactly the time that californians need them most the proposed cuts could leave as many as one million more californians uninsured to devastating effect to the health system on which we all rely

8034963 its my understanding that were either waiting on the missouri governor or he may actually be waiting on some kind of federal response because it is his job to speak for us here in the state of missouri and he may have put in a request to the federal emergency management authority and has not yet heard from them

8035000 there will be no job cuts we are a business we believe in pursuing a long term approach to growing the business were not into making knee jerk cuts in staff costs just to protect short term profit our ownership structure is key here because were owned by our partners employees they want us to take a long term not a short term approach our structure means that at these times we might take a different approach to some other businesses
8035001 well certainly tighten up on costs were not recruiting any people right now
8035002 we will take steps to train people so that we can use that across the business at times like this training people at one department to move into another one where weve got better sales growth means you can actually manage your demand that way

8035006 this is a bit obvious but success is a matter of streams and paths dont overanalyze the road rather build with bricks and you will fly
8035007 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
8035008 but right now i feel like theres so many aspects of our great nation which could use a little bit of help or a lotta bit of help that its hard to pick just one
8035009 i think the most important thing is the economy we need to figure out the housing crisis we need to build up our middle class again right now the disparity between the uber rich and the uber poor its worrying and its not getting better we need to focus on a way to just get our economy back to get it back on track
8035010 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
8035011 i am concerned about the audience and their acceptance time will tell
8035012 scheduling is very difficult two of them happened to be in venice at the same time because of the burn after reading premiere so there was a brainstorming session
8035013 you can wait a lifetime for a player like that owen is not only one player he is a very special player
8035014 he is very important to this football club and my vision for it and if other people do not share that it is their problem i do not say these things publicly for any other reason than i believe it
8035015 i know the kind of people you need at a football club you can wait a lifetime for people who can help take it forward and he is one
8035016 did not see the current stance of policy as particularly accommodative
8035017 i want to keep that all internal my state is not so important what is important is the performance of arsenal
8035018 we keep that internal and secret we had a bad game and it happens fulham had a good game as well
8035019 you cannot say you are happy when you lose a game in the way we lost that game what is very important is the way we respond
8035020 we want to play at the top level and to be at the top level is to be in the champions league
8035021 we have decided that inler remains in udinese any player would want to play for arsenal of course but for inler this may be perhaps a little early maybe a season too early
8035022 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8035023 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8035024 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8035025 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8035026 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8035027 i am back in moscow and i will not play in kiev i am waiting for a visa and as soon as it is granted i am ready to go to england and sign
8035028 its disappointing and frustrating and they probably deserved the victory
8035029 some of the players didnt do themselves justice and now well move on to saturday and hopefully get some points on the board
8035030 so far weve been beaten by a team that finished third and a team that finished fifth in the premier league which isnt a disgrace and if we continue to play like that well be fine but if we play like we did tonight well be in trouble
8035031 its a great night for the club and id like to think we can build on this and generate some momentum when they scored that late goal we stuck in there and the players played with their brains as well as their hearts
8035032 the better side won we lost our shape and discipline this has highlighted how we need more strength in depth and i will try and add to our squad before the transfer window closes
8035033 the game had a bit of everything we controlled the game against a premiership side and got exactly what we deserved
8035034 bayo really bullied boltons defenders and im proud of his performance because he has had his injury problems with us we had to get a steel plate taken out of his leg in the summer and he played tonight with 12 stitches in a head wound
8035035 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president

8035042 the water is used to escort the toxins out of your body but often they get lodged in your tissue your body wants to flush the toxins but when they dont go your body continues to retain the water which makes it look fat and puffy
8035043 ergo the more artificial sweeteners you put in your mouth the more water your body retains to protect you from the risk of toxic effects and the fatter you look the bodys reaction to artificial sweeteners is also a cause of ugly cellulite

8035047 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it
8035048 my inclination is you have to be careful about attacking mccain
8035049 to make sure people know who barack obama is who joe biden is
8035050 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8035054 having a different kind of consciousness of sexual attraction and living differently from the
8035055 hes shown a complete lack of respect to the club his fellow players our history and the fans
8035056 i dont think anybody else will be going craig looked so sharp in pre season and he gives us something extra with his pace
8035057 he is in full training so its more realistic hell be ready on saturday for the game with blackburn
8035058 west ham united have absolutely no intention of selling craig bellamy he is under contract and is committed to the club craig remains a very important part of our plans for the future
8035059 the club are being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
8035060 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
8035061 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
8035062 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do so as and when appropriate
8035063 this week is notorious for things being done and well have to see what happens
8035064 were under pressure because were short at the back because of injury and thats left us a bit stretched
8035065 he is out of touch i dont think he realizes what ordinary americans are going through
8035066 i was about to leave and by the time i got up i started smelling smoke and i went to the hallway and there was a lot of smoke out the smoke was out in the hallway and if it wasnt for me nobody would have gotten out
8035067 i got all the kids took them to the escape window and when they threw them out simon he turned around to get tia but she disappeared
8035068 i went looking for her and she wasnt in the bedroom and i tried to go down the hall and the fire was so hot and the smoke and i couldnt go down the hall so i jumped out the window opened the front door and i couldnt go inside
8035069 there is on foster in my family we are all one big family
8035070 learn from it a lot of people they go home at night and say oh it cant happen to me once it does they cant do anything about it
8035071 im glad i never have to come back or drive down the road and see the house where it all happened in
8035072 not for me i cant speak for the rest of my family but for me no it didnt help
8035073 kayla and my mother will be buried next to each other in michigan memorial park and it will be closure for my mother and my daughter
8035074 when you look back historically torontos been a graveyard for young defencemen that maybe shouldnt have been integrated into the nhl lineup as early as they were
8035075 when you look at your top two lines were going to have a lot of young players there this year
8035076 how we fare during the regular season will depend very much on how half a dozen of our young players progress
8035077 were not going to be able to start finding that out until we drop the puck for real
8035078 the key word for the maple leafs management and coaching is going to be patience
8035079 you cant force things to happen you have to let them unfold and happen at their own pace
8035080 we will be patient we will give a lot of young players that opportunity to become better players and to become a good hockey team
8035081 in the corner and retiring with a good book but not all the concerns expressed can be so casually dismissed as tawdry and at times silly as some of this is there are profound legal and moral issues involved
8035082 we have your ip information and we know who you are that is not just a
8035083 the faculty or act of expressing or describing thoughts feelings or perceptions by the articulation of words
8035084 i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
8035085 give me the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely according to conscience above all liberties
8035086 if the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter
8035087 if there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it
8035088 i am really mortified that the sale of a book can become a subject of inquiry and of criminal inquiry too are we to have a censor whose imprimatur shall say what books may be sold and what we may buy whose foot is to be the measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched
8035089 we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms the first is freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world
8035090 the satanic verses published in 1988 led to violent protest in several muslim countries and a fatwa issued against him by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini then the supreme leader of iran
8035091 free speech is the whole thing the whole ball game free speech is life itself
8035092 pamphlets became a significant means of mass communication and an essential vehicle for carrying on political debates in colonial america
8035093 from pamphlets may be learned the genius of the age the debates of the learned the bevues of government and mistakes of the courtiers they carry a reputation of wit and learning to allthat make them their companions
8035094 all of the federalist papers were signed by publius a pseudonym representing the trio of james madison alexander hamilton and john jay
8035095 inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source whether corporation association union or individual
8035096 people are permitted to interact pseudonymously and anonymously with each other so long as those acts are not in violation of the law this ability to speak ones mind without the burden of the other party knowing all the facts about ones identity can foster open communication and robust debate
8035097 fear of serious injury cannot alone justify suppression of free speech and assembly men feared witches and burned women it is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears
8035098 notwithstanding the legitimacy and importance of the congressional goal of protecting children from harmful materials we agree with the three judge district court that the statute abridges the freedom of speech protected by the first amendment
8035099 to fail to recognize that the first amendment right to speak anonymously should be extended to communications on the internet would require this court to ignore either united states supreme court precedent or the realities of speech in the twenty first century
8035100 inherent in first amendment protections is the right to speak anonymously in diverse contexts
8035101 t he practice of persons sharing common views banding together to achieve a common end is deeply embedded in the american political process
8035102 t he free exchange of ideas on the internet is driven in large part by the ability of internet users to communicate anonymously
8035103 unless online anonymity is protected whistleblowers who want to criticize their employers parents who want to criticize the principal of their childrens school and many others may be afraid to speak out that would be a loss for our country
8035104 as a means of ensuring that plaintiffs do not use discovery procedures to ascertain the identities of unknown defendants in order to harass intimidate or silence critics in the public forum opportunities presented by the internet
8035105 against the backdrop of first amendment protection for anonymous speech courts have held that civil subpoenas seeking information regarding anonymous individuals raise first amendment concerns
8035106 the constitutional rights of internet users including the first amendment right to speak anonymously must be carefully safeguarded
8035107 i f internet users could be stripped of that anonymity by a civil subpoena enforced under the liberal rules of civil discovery this would have a significant chilling effect on internet communications and thus on basic first amendment rights

8035110 the study confirmed that olive leaf extract efla 943 has antihypertensive properties in humans
8035111 this works showed that taking a 1000mg dose has substantial effects in people with borderline hypertension
8035112 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8035113 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8035114 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries

8035134 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8035135 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change
8035136 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8035137 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks

8035154 the laws that have been on the books have been there since the early 80s
8035155 i sincerely believe that this bill puts families at a risk on the highways and would result in death or serious injury
8035156 i am deeply concerned about 9 foot boats meeting a school bus the buses travel primarily on rural roads and often in the dark during early morning and early evening hours
8035157 what the governor has done by stopping this bill is forced all these larger boats to travel during the day and on weekdays when the school buses are on the roads
8035158 so if he truly feels that its a safety issue then why wont he allow these boats to travel on weekends and holidays when the school buses arent out there
8035159 and its not just boat builders the boat dealers the marina owners the restaurants the motels the hotels the tackle shop i mean the list goes on
8035160 to achieve this you simply have to be interesting you dont have to write the next iliad you just need to put it in the right form
8035161 we were realizing that our short term suspension numbers was increasing we looked at data from 2005 to last year and saw an increase

8035198 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity

8035241 were just coming back from europe were really tired and this is bad news
8035242 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8035243 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8035244 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8035245 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8035246 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8035247 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment

8035253 i have not been informed of any subsequent allegations by a proper authority

8035255 we strongly support the process of thoroughly investigating allegations of sexual misconduct towards children
8035256 if theres anyone out there that is currently concerned they may be the subject of this particular investigation they are urged to come forward in the strictest confidence and contact crimestoppers

8035320 i like to talk about trophies that is the main thing the champions league is also about money and you have to take the two things together but we are here to win titles not to make money
8035321 we will give it our best but if we somehow manage to make it through it will be the biggest shock by a belgian side in 40 years all i keep hearing is how poorly liverpool are playing at the moment but when i looked at the premier league table on saturday night they were top with maximum points
8035322 sometimes you need a kick up the backside similar to the one we had against liege
8035323 you dont want to go into the season a little complacent and no one could argue with the fact that liege were the better side on the night
8035324 we have maximum points from the first two games and still havent played anywhere near the level we are capable of we know we can improve but at least we kept going to the end against middlesbrough and showed great character
8035325 es el partido m s importante desde que soy entrenador del atl tico de madrid para m y para mis jugadores es el partido de mayor trascendencia algo que coment con el presidente que me reconoci que tambi n para l era el de m s importancia desde que accedi al cargo habl con la plantilla y les dijo a los jugadores que su obligaci n era entregarse como profesionales que son insistiendo en que tienen que luchar y pelear por esta camiseta

8035329 entiendo que la gente diga es el salvador pero el plantel es inteligente y sabe lo que tiene que hacer en cada momento para m desde luego es importante dirigir al atl tico de madrid en la champions league porque fui contratado para ello

8035398 fighters can make or break their careers with a few good or bad fights so im not going to let any fight slip by
8035399 i had all the upper tier fighters on his plateau and i thought that i was far off getting a big win like that let me know that i could compete at that level
8035400 the ultimate fighter was great for me because it put me on television in front of everyone
8035401 on the local level mma shows are filled by fighters selling tickets to their friends
8035402 you always try to have a worst case scenario opponent in mind while training and bj is just that
8035403 i learned from that fight that i need to pace myself better and not think that i have to go all out from bell to bell
8035404 it was real tough in colorado with the elevation i tried to prepare for it but i didnt do enough it was a costly lesson but one that i will never make again
8035405 we have a life skills program where we teach them how to deal with life without having to shoot each other or stab each other and also that theres a life outside of crime you know teach them how to do life on lifes terms
8035406 i know what its like out here on the streets ive jammed my whole life up and if i can just give back a little bit if one person learns a little bit thats what its all about
8035407 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8035408 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8035409 recommend ways to improve the 4 year old artist studio and exhibition facilitys operations
8035410 the thing that we care about right now is getting our team better if you watched our first three preseason games theres a lot of work we have to do
8035411 whether its your second year in the league or 12th year in the league its a pretty somber day
8035412 just in the sense of guys that are potentially losing their jobs typically its kind of weird
8035413 i dont think that the players at the same position are necessarily in competition with each other
8035414 we want to keep the best players and that may be a balanced roster or not it may include a few more players at one position and a few less at another
8035415 i know the backfield is crowded but ive also said i know what im capable of doing
8035416 unfortunately i had this setback with the injury this past couple of weeks but once they make their decision what theyre going to do if im here its just up to me to make sure that come sunday im at my best
8035417 i guess especially in preseason we actually get more reps or more carries than we do in the actual game i think it puts the onus a little more individually to go out and execute with the limited amount of actual game reps
8035418 we probably have one of the deepest backfields in the league
8035419 the thing about us is that we all bring something different to the table which gives the defense a different look
8035420 if you are running a race with a guy and he is a lap ahead of you and you have a strong finish you are still going to finish behind him
8035421 if you are neck and neck with the guy and you have a strong finish then you beat him and it makes a lot of difference
8035422 so it would depend on what the relationship of the competition is at this point for how much the last game means

8035424 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations

8035426 i have not been informed of any subsequent allegations by a proper authority
8035427 we view allegations of any sexual misconduct towards children with grave concern we are concerned for the wellbeing of any child whether they now be adult or not who may have been subject to abuse
8035428 we strongly support the process of thoroughly investigating allegations of sexual misconduct towards children

8035442 has decided to stop using the word progressive to describe the more liberal of san franciscos political factions
8035443 also i should tell you that we did not make this change in response or after complaints from anyone in the mayors office the mayors office does not dictate what words we use
8035444 nobody from the mayors office has ever contacted me about this issue as far as i can honestly remember and i cant recall them saying anything about it over the last two weeks either
8035445 personally ive never really complained to the chronicle about this subject
8035446 i have to admit that im pleased to learn from you that the chronicle will no longer be using the term progressive to describe politicians who arent
8035447 well its true that the progressives of the early part of the century tended to be against prostitution and drugs and were prohibitionists a description that i dont think would accurately describe say aaron peskin
8035448 i dont think far left even remotely describes people like peskin whose economic views are pretty close to the mainstream of the liberal wing of the democratic party
8035449 i say this as someone who has been called all sorts of names including communist because i advocate higher taxes on the rich and government spending on social services for the poor
8035450 so who in sf government do you really believe is far left
8035451 tim do us all a favor and count me out of this dorm room style debate i never really cared that much whether the chronicle called these guys progressives just like i never really cared that much that cw post calls them grape nuts even though they are neither grapes nor nuts
8035452 thank you for your reply i was throwing in a little humor here albeit obscure a reference to the big lebowski
8035453 having said that i do believe the chrons use of ultra left and far left is completely biased
8035454 its unbelievable that you would even try to justify your use of this language
8035455 lastly if any term is completely meaningless its moderate i dont recall there being a moderate political movement or ideology a classical greek philosophy maybe but not a political movement like the progressive movement progressives established labor laws the womens right to vote and regulations of our workplaces and food production i dont believe moderates can claim any such movement or transformation of our government institutions if theres something they can champion its ameliorating the effects of change or fighting against perennial progressive issues such as single payer health care taxing high profits and rent control thank you for your response i really appreciate your sharing with me the chronicles rationale however shakey it may be sincerely john avalos

8035496 genuinamente laico considera le voci religiose alla pari di tutte le altre voci non governative nel contesto pubblico
8035497 devono considerarsi loro stessi come organizzazioni della societ civile come i sindacati i partiti politici gli scout e cos via con tutto il diritto di esistere e di avere qualcosa da dire ma in quanto gruppi di interesse auto costituiti non pi titolati a detenere una porzione pi grande della torta pubblica di influenza privilegio distribuzioni di tasse ed esenzioni legali rispetto ad altri auto nominati gruppi di interesse

8035610 were trying to do cutting edge avian medicine and develop advanced surgical techniques
8035611 windows into vet hospitals are a pretty new idea were the nations aviary so we want this to be educational for visitors to see behind the scenes
8035612 were very excited about having two pools we didnt have a place for birds waiting for surgery it wasnt efficient or great for the birds
8035613 we had really outgrown our old space it was in great need of repair and wasnt conducive to a community center
8035614 what we have now is truly remarkable its a beautiful family friendly space and there are a tremendous amount of things we can do
8035615 well have everything from technical assistance providers the to business development folks and conventional banks
8035616 anybody with the sophistication to put together a proposal is game
8035617 wed like to see something funky or traditional that relates to renovated storefronts on the avenue
8035618 well determine what has the best chance to make this fit into where we see the avenue now and in five years who has the capacity to pull it off
8035619 we visited many schools to see what their program looked like there are few schools with this designation in the state
8035620 we spent one year piloting new technologies teachers were greatly involved in what the classrooms should look like
8035621 the concept of promoting retails sales of wine to the public is very confusing to people because people dont understand what that means
8035622 nobody can tell you what beef tastes like if youve never eaten it
8035623 i cant tell you oh youre going to love this chardonnay
8035624 i think people are just becoming more sophisticated about it though not everybodys a collector nor do we want them to be
8035625 we have also seen the product mix become more sophisticated at one point in time we paid the rent by the white zinfandel sales and now we dont necessarily consistently even have a white zinfandel in our book to sell then we saw everybody start to drink chardonnays and then they went to merlots and now theyre going into more diverse things so i think thats true not just of pittsburgh people are slowly but surely educating themselves
8035626 you can only read so much to understand wine you can get some knowledge that way but its a sensory subject its about the taste and the smell until we have scratch and sniff or scratch and taste books youre going to have to drink it to really understand
8035627 people often ask us how we feel about two buck chuck
8035628 i ask them what they like and then offer suggestions tailored to their interests
8035629 i encourage people not to drive its a city you see on a strolling town
8035630 if youre not afraid of me im not afraid of you
8035631 it was spectacular in the four or five years i have played one day internationals we have not hammered a team as convincingly as that before theres an energy and a buzz about us
8035632 really exceptional but i think i am in a fortunate position to have four bowlers bowling at 90 miles per hour and i am sure if previous captains had them firing on all cylinders at the start of their campaign or whenever it was i am sure they would have been alright
8035633 it is great being a part of this bowling unit
8035634 you have got the knowledge and experience of fred andrew flintoff and harmy steve harmison who are always passing it on and its thoroughly enjoyable
8035635 it would be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
8035636 theres going to be an independent kosovo were dedicated to that
8035637 in our statement we recorded our fundamental position that the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo contradicts resolution 1244 russia india and china encourage belgrade and pristina to resume talks within the framework of international law and hope they reach an agreement on all problems of that serbian territory
8035638 the decision was made for several key reasons first and foremost the pennsylvania economic development team was very competitive with regard to financial incentives
8035639 its a highly educated productive workforce theres synergy because we have an existing facility in the area
8035640 theres a focus on alternative energy nationally we feel theres tremendous growth opportunity in putting a footprint of manufacturing facility in the u s
8035641 our intent is to service a global market from pittsburgh
8035642 were very excited to be on the front edge of where a lot of growth is happening its an underserved area with great access for shoppers from the multi state region were also close to the city of pittsburgh many of our centers are in close proximity to major markets like pittsburgh
8035643 its been a great partnership to have a project like this come to fruition it takes a lot of teamwork

8035651 what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
8035652 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
8035653 if you look at the numbers theres bad news in the story
8035654 and even into poverty where they are caught by the public healthcare program safety net
8035655 it doesnt capture what it costs to meet some of a familys basic necessities
8035656 even using those low standards more families especially with children are sliding into poverty and becoming eligible for public programs
8035657 it still assumes that american families spend about one third of their budget on food but whats really punishing american families are housing and energy costs
8035658 by every measure 2008 is going to be worse clearly there are going to be increasing problems growth in poverty and higher unemployment especially among unskilled workers
8035659 want to hear what their political leaders are going to do to reduce it
8035660 as more americans struggle to make ends meet we have seen a growing willingness among political leaders from both parties to talk about how to come up with concrete and workable solutions
8035661 we also want to bring the software development unit to romania
8035662 at present were looking at other cities to open the second bpo centre
8035663 even though romanias wage base is much lower these wage increases by 15 20 i e will shortly turn you into an expensive location
8035664 things have gone well so far i think well have around 300 400 people in romania in the following year
8035665 you must pay attention to wage increases its a very serious problem
8035666 hoy quiz s no hemos estado tan precisos pero hay un contrario que juega adem s hemos tenido cinco o seis ocasiones de gol delante del portero hemos perdido pero hemos podido empatar e incluso ganar
8035667 es un equipo muy organizado y se demuestra que est muy trabajado
8035668 un empate contra la juventus es un buen resultado podemos estar varios a os hasta que veamos si un conjunto eslovaco consigue un empate contra la juventus
8035669 esto es exactamente lo que dese bamos ahora lo daremos todo para jugar la final en roma

8035672 this is the time that the authorities will storm into the government house
8035673 they know they cannot let protesters stay because we will make trouble for the government there are a lot of people who want to join us but have been blocked by the police

8035682 the payment was made by me to assist funding the legal costs incurred personally by rt hon winston peters mp concerning his election petition dispute at his request
8035683 mr peters sought help from me for this purpose in a personal conversation some time after i had first met him in sydney
8035684 i agreed to help in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters i supported the labour party
8035685 some time after i had first met him in sydney
8035686 one can question whether mr glenn actually knows this letter has gone out have a look at the letter you might be the only one to realise mr glenn has not signed it no one has signed it anyone could have written that letter
8035687 mr glenn in his supposed letter said he did not make a contribution to nz first so i think there is a lack of credibility in mr glenns correspondence he has contradicted himself
8035688 i do not wish this letter to be treated as being private or secret the facts of the matter are simple i am happy for them to be public information
8035689 i think the prime minister should be calling the foreign minister in right now and asking for some explanation

8035696 we will develop a project in bacau the plot has been bought recently but i cannot say more for the time being because the project is in an incipient stage
8035697 the growth rate of the turnover in the last five months of 2008 will stand at 15 compared with the same time in 2007 the annual average in 2008 will be approximately 25 compared with 2007
8035698 bineinteles ca mai multe persoane din zona golfului si au exprimat interesul pentru cumpararea hummer au existat si precedente pentru astfel de situatii cum ar fi cazul brandurilor aston martin ferrari sau daimler iar solutiile gasite in cazul lor ar putea fi foarte realiste
8035699 i am very happy very proud i have done a country of four million people done my family proud my parents
8035700 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
8035701 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
8035702 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
8035703 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
8035704 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
8035705 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
8035706 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed

8035716 break the georgian state undermine the fundamental values of georgia and to wipe georgia from the map
8035717 this is the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to put a neighbouring state on its knees and to change the borders of europe by force

8035720 problema cea mai mare a romaniei este cresterea salariilor daca salariile continua sa creasca cu 15 20 in fiecare an romania va deveni ca restul europei in europa in general salariile cresc cu 3 4 pe an chiar daca baza salariala in romania este cu mult mai joasa aceste cresteri salariale va vor transforma intr o locatie scumpa in foarte scurt timp

8035722 nu exista un deficit sever de forta de munca in romania noi ne luam angajatii direct din facultate si ii formam astfel incat sa poata lucra in acest domeniu daca ai resursele potrivite si trainingul potrivit este o problema care poate fi gestionata
8035723 senior managerii buni sunt greu de gasit si sunt foarte scumpi este mai ieftin pentru noi sa trimitem un indian cu mandat de expatriere decat sa angajam un roman vrem sa localizam cat de mult se poate dar exista un deficit la acest nivel de management n r

8035725 trebuie sa fiti atenti la cresterile salariale este o problema foarte serioasa am vorbit cu cativa investitori din industria auto care s au confruntat cu cresteri salariale de 25 in ultima perioada si care au decis sa nu se mai extinda in romania din cauza costurilor salariale ridicate
8035726 sunt multi speculatori la bursa in momentul de fata piata fiind facuta practic de acestia atata timp cat singura stire aparuta pe plan international despre romania a fost zilele trecute cresterea costurilor cu forta de munca atunci putem intelege de ce investitorii straini nu au o parere foarte buna despre noi ei nu stau sa analizeze si sa vada exact despre ce este vorba in romania

8035732 once the team management and the swimmers and nzoc get back in the country well meet with them and review everything and decide at that stage whether any further action is necessary
8035733 im just really keen to make sure something silly like this doesnt overshadow the incredible performances that they had
8035734 whether its a cycling team or a swimming team its made pretty clear to them what the code of conduct is and clearly something like this probably breaches that
8035735 for something like this to put a dampener on it is a real shame
8035736 inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
8035737 its something that both swimming new zealand and the nzoc will have to address its not something that can be ignored
8035738 any time protocol isnt followed it has to be addressed

8035751 am investit 10 milioane de dolari 6 5 milioane de euro pe an dar suma creste cu repeziciune pentru ca se pot face profituri mari
8035752 asteptarile privind rezultatele financiare pentru primul semestru au fost mai mult sperante in sensul in care toata lumea astepta raportari cat mai bune care sa duca la o revenire a pietei de capital odata cu venirea rezultatelor bune pentru diferite companii au venit si marcarile de profit care impreuna cu lichiditatea scazuta din piata au dus la pierderile inregistrate in ultimele saptamani
8035753 s a cumparat inainte de rezultate si s a vandut imediat dupa ce acestea au fost raportate nu avem multi investitori in adevaratul sens al cuvantului in piata iar pe cei care sunt prezenti scaderile ii ajuta
8035754 rezultatele raportate de brd au fost intr adevar bune insa au inselat asteptarile in special dupa ce banca transilvania si erste bank au inregistrat cresteri mult mai mari ale profiturilor
8035755 toata lumea a asteptat rezultatele cu speranta ca acestea vor atrage fonduri mai mari de investitii sau investitori straini insa pana la urma doar sif urile au intrat la cumparare dar nu cu sume mari
8035756 in primul semestru al anului companiile de ingrasaminte au beneficiat de cresterea puternica a pretului ingrasamintelor pe pietele internationale ca urmare a majorarii semnificative a taxelor de export de catre china dar si a cresterii suprafetelor cultivate cu cereale destinate producerii de etanol in detrimentul celor de uz alimentar
8035757 acest cumul de factori da un caracter conjuctural recentelor performante ale producatorilor autohtoni de ingrasaminte prin urmare aceste riscuri pot fi cauza scaderilor cotatiilor in ciuda rezultatelor financiare peste asteptari in acest context o parte din investitori preferand marcarea profiturilor
8035758 in sectorul chimic dupa rezultatele financiare au venit imediat si marcarile de profit inclusiv din partea acelora care au cumparat de exemplu azomures la un pret mai ridicat
8035759 the payment was made by me to assist funding the legal costs incurred personally by rt hon winston peters mp concerning his election petition dispute at his request
8035760 mr peters sought help from me for this purpose in a personal conversation some time after i had first met him in sydney
8035761 i agreed to help in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters i supported the labour party
8035762 some time after i had first met him in sydney
8035763 one can question whether mr glenn actually knows this letter has gone out have a look at the letter you might be the only one to realise mr glenn has not signed it no one has signed it anyone could have written that letter
8035764 mr glenn in his supposed letter said he did not make a contribution to nz first so i think there is a lack of credibility in mr glenns correspondence he has contradicted himself
8035765 i do not wish this letter to be treated as being private or secret the facts of the matter are simple i am happy for them to be public information

8035773 s a intamplat ce isi dorea bnr incetinirea creditarii care avea un ritm nesustenabil iar franarea s a produs chiar inainte de aplicarea masurilor administrative
8035774 deocamdata scaderea nu este ingrijoratoare fiind vorba de o singura luna daca vom vedea insa trei patru luni de scadere atunci inseamna ca masurile adoptate de bnr au fost prea dure oricum venim dupa niste luni cu ritm destul de ridicat de crestere a creditarii

8035779 now we are out of the cup its a joke
8035780 i was very disappointed to lose the fourth goal because of what happened before that
8035781 i took a towel and threw it on the floor and the referee puts me in the stand because of that i mean why
8035782 im not allowed to do that does it say somewhere im not allowed to do that i dont think so
8035783 everything was under control we approach these games seriously and we want to win them theres no question about that
8035784 one day i was out hiking in the kakadu outback trying to clear my head i twisted my ankle running from a crocodile my water spilled and i became lost dehydrated and disoriented i was found by a family of kangaroos who nursed me back to health i had always seen them care for one another at the zoo but i never expected that concern extended to humans that gave me an idea
8035785 the level of patient recovery has doubled since kangaroos have joined the nursing staff
8035786 as long as charts are fastened securely to the doors and ivs and sutures are double bandaged we dont have to worry about things falling down shaking loose or popping
8035787 youd be surprised how many people die down here every week
8035788 dozens of folks pass away in these parts monday to sunday
8035789 they die of injury disease old age alligator attacks and so forth
8035790 back in the early days we used to have a cadaver car to move em out a subway train which would run the entire line wed gather the individuals we found along the way and deliver them to paupers graves but we started to run out of space so they took the cadaver car to the bone boat which buried the bodies in the river
8035791 unfortunately a garbage strike in 88 left our scow stranded in the harbor for over a week
8035792 that was very unfortunate not for the bodies far as i know they didnt care but it was bad for the people who lived in the battery park area
8035793 i looked at those bodies thinking my brother is a commercial pilot im a body gatherer it was like peanut butter hitting chocolate in that old commercial
8035794 i still gather the poor de ceased souls as before
8035795 but now i put them in an air conditioned bus the ac is for my benefit since these folks arent nosegays and i personally drive them to a variety of small airports in the tri state area
8035796 there are deep seats to keep the passengers from sliding around and a lot of leg room since theyre well stiff

8035800 amd este in cursul unei transformari ce vizeaza crearea unui model de afacere pentru a sustine profitabilitatea
8035801 este mai ieftin sa aducem un expat indian decat sa angajam un executiv roman
8035802 in conditiile unei prezente de sase ani in bucuresti extinderea si modernizarea centrului logistic si de productie a devenit esentiala pentru mentinerea ritmului de dezvoltare astfel noul sediu a fost proiectat pentru a sustine volumul de lucrari in crestere in domeniul energetic si al telecomunicatiilor in zona de sud si sud est a tarii
8035803 ritmul de crestere al cifrei de afaceri raportat la ultimele cinci luni ale anului 2008 va fi de 15 fata de aceeasi perioada a anului trecut media anuala pe 2008 va fi de circa 25 fata de anul 2007
8035804 saltul cifrei de afaceri pe anul trecut se datoreaza lansarii de produse noi si deschiderii de noi sectii de productie de asemenea cresterea a fost influentata de majorarea preturilor la produsele de morarit
8035805 pur si simplu sa ti propui un obiectiv ca vreau sa cresc vanzarile anul viitor cu x nu mai e suficient pentru ca in mod evident toti jucatorii de pe piata respectiva isi propun cresteri de vanzari n am auzit pe nimeni sa isi propuna un obiectiv de business la anul ne propunem sa scadem vanzarile cu atat
8035806 sa ti stabilesti pur si simplu un obiectiv de a creste cu un anumit procent fara sa te intrebi de la ce companie urmeaza sa iei din cota de piata e sinucidere curata tot mai multe companii trebuie sa gandeasca in termeni de cu cine ma bat si de la cine vreau sa iau cota de piata faptul ca multe companii descopera pe parcurs ca nu au competente necesare in propria curte le determina sa apeleze la consultanta
8035807 am inceput de foarte jos am invatat foarte mult la traininguri si din cartile citite probabil societatea s a mai asezat momentan si cea mai mare parte a specialistilor care lucreaza acum in marketing chiar au terminat o facultate de marketing
8035808 ce am simtit cel mai mult ca lipsea a fost spiritul antreprenorial al candidatilor probabil fiecare isi dorea un loc de munca intr o companie la fel de structurata la fel de organizata din punctul de vedere al procedurilor managementului ca cea din care urmau sa plece voiau acelasi statut de angajat si nu erau pregatite sa si asume rolul de antreprenor

8035811 sa mi iau acum un junior pentru ca in sapte opt ani de zile timp in care competitia se va inteti sa l am format dupa cultura mea organizationala n a fost posibil nu cred ca a fost timp nici resurse si nici viziune in multe dintre companiile locale
8035812 de la an la an aproape am dublat cifra de afaceri si acest lucru inseamna o suma de clienti care au nevoie de atentie din nou suntem la stadiul in care suntem la limita cu numarul de clienti de care putem avea grija probabil ca la incarcarea actuala mai putem lua maxim un client
8035813 cei cu care lucram sunt companii care trebuie sa fie prezente in industrii foarte active cu multi competitori intr o industrie in care sunt doi trei jucatori care isi impart piata e foarte greu sa ne gasim clienti
8035814 e normal ca o perioada de timp de acomodare si pana cand cel care ni se va alatura va fi in stare sa genereze new business e normal sa aiba niste venituri din proiectele deja existente lucrand alaturi de noi
8035815 nu ne dorim sa infiintam o structura paralela pentru a i manageria pe oamenii cu care vom lucra nu vrem sa ne transformam niciodata intr o companie de consultanta mare in termeni de numar de oameni ci doar ca servicii si rezultate de calitate
8035816 barack obama has released an ad responding to a third party ad that links obama with radical antiwar activist bill ayers
8035817 prima data mi a venit ideea de a face ceva pentru ca aveam destul de mult timp liber m am gandit sa am un loc al meu unde sa pot sa ma intalnesc cu prietenii
8035818 in iulie 2007 am inchiriat spatiul si amenajarea lui a durat pana in decembrie am ales locatia aceasta deoarece in zona sunt birouri universitati particulare iar dimineata inainte de a incepe lucrul sau in pauze oamenii vin sa serveasca la noi o cafea un sandvis sau o prajitura
8035819 cand am intrat sa prezint rubrica meteo cabral imi spunea broscuta iar asociatului meu i s a parut interesant ca denumirea cafenelei sa aiba legatura cu porecla
8035820 ne am gandit sa apelam la un arhitect pentru decorarea localului insa nu ne au placut ideile pe care le avea asa ca am inceput singuri sa l amenajam am luat tapetul si apoi a venit mobilierul
8035821 cafeneaua am vrut sa fie ca un loc unde oamenii sa vina si sa se simta ca acasa acesta a fost si conceptul in functie de care am ales mobilierul am incercat sa gasim la anticariat oglinzi insa erau foarte scumpe canapeaua fotoliile si oglinzile din baie le am de la mama sunt mostenire de familie si am considerat ca se potrivesc foarte bine in cafenea astfel ca le am luat si le am retapitat am alergat doua saptamani dupa cuiere pentru ca nu gaseam unele potrivite ca forma cu ceea ce gandisem eu
8035822 scrumierele trebuiau sa fie aurii in ton cu nuantele folosite pentru decorul incaperii astfel ca dupa indelungi cautari pe internet am gasit un magazin pe dn1 care comercializa scrumiere din alama am mers cu asociatul meu si am gasit intr un final locatia de pe internet iar persoana de la care am cumparat scrumierele mai vindea alaturi de acestea tamaie si iconite
8035823 a fost putin dificil pana l am realizat meniul n red am luat cafenelele la rand sa vad ce ofereau am angajat apoi barmanul si impreuna am realizat meniul iar preturile le am stabilit cu contabila
8035824 unul dintre clienti ne a solicitat un cocktail cu sampanie si am inceput sa aducem si aceasta specialitate chiar daca am fost nevoiti sa cautam pe google reteta
8035825 primele lectii le am luat de la colegii mei ajutandu i la bar pentru prepararea bauturilor de mai bine de o luna am inceput sa urmez cursuri de barman trebuie sa stiu ce se intampla cu afacerea mea
8035826 cand am ales tipul de cafea pe care il vom servi am luat pur si simplu mai multe oferte iar cel mai mult ne a placut prezentarea de la julius mein a fost o chestie mai mult de estetica decat de gust pentru ca pe langa ceasca de cafea se mai aduce la masa si un biscuite un pahar cu apa iar cand clientul vede atat de multe lucruri este multumit decat daca ii duci o simpla ceasca de cafea
8035827 avem pe tura un ospatar si un barman plus un angajat care este alaturi de noi inca de cand am deschis si care supervizeaza tot ce se intampla in cafenea am tot schimbat personalul in primul rand datorita mentalitatii acestora nu respectau tot timpul retetele
8035828 nu am plecat de la ideea de a ma imbogati vreau ca oamenii sa se simta bine am clienti fideli studenti oameni care vin in fiecare zi mi am facut prieteni noi
8035829 in principal cafeneau este plina dimineata intre orele 9 11 cand cei de la camera de comert din birourile alaturate noua vin cu laptopul sa lucreze in timp ce isi iau cafeaua iar apoi dupa ora doua cand este pauza de masa in rest seara se strang cu prietenii la un suc
8035830 un client ne a solicitat sa organizam o petrecere si asa am inceput sa inchiriem spatiul practic nu cerem chirie pentru sala doar consumatia care se face in seara respectiva e suficienta ca si castig pentru noi
8035831 oamenii afla de cafenea si vin si alta data si vor aduce si alti clienti acesta este principiul pe care mergem de obicei la o petrecere de acest gen vin circa 15 persoane care afla de noi
8035832 daca iti place si faci cu pasiune ceea ce faci nu e greu important este sa ai oameni care sa te ajute
8035833 i believe the best forum for voters to see the candidates in their work clothes is in a debate
8035834 the debate format presents the opportunity for the candidates to not only
8035835 i am fascinated by the question and process of what is being excluded in the frame the goal of this alternate method of taking photos was to playfully twist cinematic methods and as a result challenge the viewer to reassess common scenes and scenarios when they appear with intensified focus
8035836 i am very happy very proud i have done a country of four million people done my family proud my parents

8035853 we will call for the alternative solution for the palestinian people and their leadership that is a single bi nationalist state
8035854 inevitably the vast majority of jewish israelis will view any talk about a one state solution as a threat even as an existential threat
8035855 the real choice is therefore the two state solution or the ethnic cleansing solution
8035856 in spite of eloquent and articulate views and analyses by palestinian intellectuals
8035857 the vast majority of the public according to public opinion polls and the majority of the political elite consider the idea of a bi national state a dangerous alternative strategy
8035858 we want the right to visit our families in other villages and towns we want the right to work
8035859 early in my er career i decided i would not press my medical opinions on people who did not request them
8035860 i wanted to say and ask many things but i did not
8035861 my job if i had one involved being supportive to do otherwise i told myself to attempt to insert myself into their intimate life would be disrespectful the last thing they needed was for me or any outsider to sow doubt
8035862 d espite all the effort and hope that patients and their families and doctors have put into breast cancer research and treatment in the past one hundred years those like marguerite who present with advanced metastatic cancer probably do not live much longer than their early 20th century counterparts it is harder to determine whether they live better

8035914 believe it or not since june 1 were still 8 1 2 inches above normal yet the crops are showing tremendous moisture stress in certain areas of the county

8035940 i felt our football players were out here working to improve they werent out here trying to survive
8035941 they were thriving individually and i think thats important and i think the schedule helped them
8035942 we were able to get all our work done and that was important
8035943 especially with the high attendance rate in the offseason to take everything from april may and june and bring it into august
8035944 i think camp was pretty good obviously we had some things that kind of didnt have the attention on our team but i think we fought through those things and we came together as a team and we made some strides and thats all you can ask for is to make some strides and to get better
8035945 we have some targets we still need to hit and we have the opportunity thursday evening versus tennessee to get that done
8035946 well have a long week of preparation prior to that first game its my responsibility and the coaches responsibility to get our team ready and i have all the confidence in the world that we will do that but we still have work to do
8035947 thats my plan is to be out there 100 percent
8035948 football is a game of repetition so anytime you miss out on your reps you always have to look better at certain things
8035949 so im going to be behind in that aspect ive been playing for a while and doing the same thing for years but it never hurts to touch up things and thats what ive been missing
8035950 i think ill be pretty close i dont think ill be that rusty im not rushing the passer or anything like that i feel confident that ill be fine

8035955 folks are talking about change and theyre hungry for it in two days were going to make history when we nominate this guy i happen to be married to president of the united states
8035956 barack obama talks about the world as it is and the world as it should be
8035957 our challenge is to narrow that and make the world as it is and the world as it should be one and the same
8035958 she was just magnificent she made us so proud our party and our country were greatly strengthened by her candidacy
8035959 this is a crucial election and i join with hillary in putting out a clarion call for unity we must elect barack obama as our next president

8035961 i just go from the first day with pads and how he did in the blitz drills and things like that then the family night scrimmage he had some opportunities he did some good things but then didnt take advantage of some opportunities he had
8035962 just week in and week out he continued to improve so ive been very impressed with what hes been able to do so far
8035963 i had to just sit and wait for that phone call i wasnt disappointed because my agent and i had talked about it and we knew the situation with my injuries
8035964 i think our scouts did a great job with their homework and research and everything
8035965 he had very good size and good feet for a big back he was powerful and had good hands for a receiver and obviously he has been showing the ability to run behind his pads push the pile and has good burst
8035966 i just stayed focused and stayed in my playbook and tried to learn from the veteran running backs
8035967 i think i have exceeded a little bit of my own expectations coming from college i didnt think i was going to adjust this fast having a great running back coach and great running backs to help me out as well it just picks me up and gives me a boost
8035968 i felt like we still had a chance to win that game if that hadnt happened i was real hard on myself after that the coaches and some of my teammates were telling me that i had a good game and i needed to bounce back from it
8035969 every opportunity he has been given hes made the most of it
8035970 thats what its all about these kids getting an opportunity and you see him day in and day out get better as we go along he just has to continue to improve and grow
8035971 were a type of football team that doesnt go out and just sign special teams players situation specific
8035972 we sign good football players both offense and defense that also play special teams its important for all of our positions because its one thing to make the 53 but more importantly you want to be on the 45 special teams is the determining factor when it comes down to going from 53 to 45 week in and week out
8035973 im just looking to have a chance to go out there against their no 1 defense maybe
8035974 i just want to do as much as i can on thursday
8035975 its not hillary clintons job to bring the party together
8035976 how is he supposed to bring the country together if he cant bring the party together and is this any way to run a government if you cant run a convention
8035977 this is a plan that does not empower individuals it empowers government
8035978 the policies hes discussing are not very much different from the ideology weve seen with past democratic candidates and voters have rejected that ideology
8035979 i also want to look you in the eye and i appreciate your generosity but i also want to tell you we will compete in the state of california we will compete and win in the state of california we will not take your money and leave
8035980 when we started this eight years ago people thought we were crazy now an online presence is a must and participation in raising funds and grassroots mobilization isnt a joke but a must have
8035981 we understand that the internet can empower certain campaign behaviors and on demand technology allows us to be creative and increase participation even by direct mail why send thousands of cards when one card from your friend or family member can be more impacting and powerful

8035992 boundary scan is an excellent example of how the efforts of a cross industry group can benefit all of the electronics industry
8035993 if we can generate greater support for boundary scan among electronic design automation eda tools suppliers and chip makers many of the downstream electronics companies such as circuit board makers and systems providers stand to benefit greatly because their products will improve in quality their test procedures will be more comprehensive and less costly
8035994 since its development in the 1990s adoption of boundary scan has benefited the industry greatly we want to expand upon this base and take it up to another level
8035995 we feel that the boundary scan ecosystem is not yet complete and we want to do what we can to ensure this technology can be applied effectively in design validation test and debug applications for chips circuit boards and systems this will pave the way for other standards that support methodologies for more complex embedded instruments such as the internal jtag ijtag ieee p1687 standard that is currently being developed

8036001 number one they need to import a large amount of wheat
8036002 if they need wheat right now the us is the place to go
8036003 the idea of that in 2000 was to promote certain types of exports to sanctioned countries so there would be food medicine agricultural products medical products
8036004 it is still surprising that they are buying wheat from the us instead of waiting to buy wheat from someone else
8036005 maybe the relationship between iran and the us is not as terrible as it has been
8036006 iran is more interested in showing to its people that it is not restrained by sanctions

8036088 nach ansicht der generalstaatsanw lte ist ein gewerbliches ausma erst dann gegeben wenn mindestens 3000 lieder oder 200 filme getauscht worden sind bei brandaktuellen titeln sollen allerdings ausnahmen gemacht werden
8036089 sicherlich wird man beim tausch von 10 oder 15 liedern keinesfalls von einem gewerblichen ausma reden k nnen
8036090 es kann sein dass einige richter schon das anbieten einer datei zum beispiel eines kompletten films oder musikalbums als handeln in gewerblichem ausma einstufen richter sind unabh ngig es wird von gericht zu gericht unterschiedliche einsch tzungen geben und bis zur endg ltigen kl rung wird viel zeit vergehen

8036139 eu acho que essa sul americana devia valer vaga para a libertadores agora n s vamos usar para lan ar os jogadores jovens para ver como eles se portam para ver quem quem essa a filosofia do clube
8036140 importante dar confian a a eles n o d para pegar entrosamento mas pelo menos um padr o t tico n o deve haver cobran a porque eles n o est o jogando para isso e sim para apresentar seu futuro e nem press o porque eles t m que jogar vontade

8036146 n o estou criticando o treinador que saiu at porque foi o cara que me trouxe para c e um grande t cnico mas acho que pelas caracter sticas dos jogadores que temos hoje aqui se tiv ssemos jogado num esquema mais simples como estamos jogando agora talvez tiv ssemos obtido melhores resultados
8036147 estamos jogando mais defensivamente mais preocupados em marcar e est dando certo

8036156 debate around the number of district health boards is a regular point of discussion and public debate particularly in this part of the electoral cycle
8036157 the minister has recently reaffirmed there are no plans for any reduction in the number of dhbs in the foreseeable future the minister has also however made no secret of his desire to see collaboration between district health boards strengthened at a faster pace
8036158 from a south canterbury perspective collaboration is an essential strategy to make sure we can continue to provide sustainable high quality services as close to home as possible
8036159 for small district health boards like south canterbury it is essential that we work with our neighbours to develop strong and sustainable clinical networks clinical services have evolved over time to a far greater level of sub specialisation
8036160 south canterburys population is not large enough to sustain all the services we need so we must work with our neighbours to ensure ongoing service provision to our local population as close to home as possible
8036161 i have made it clear on many many occasions that i expect to see increased levels of national and regional collaboration that does not equate to less dhbs
8036162 there are 21 dhbs now and there will be 21 dhbs into the foreseeable future
8036163 it really gives the river a good cleanout and shifts the gravel out it helps by getting the bed moving and creating new holes and new habitat it changes the nature of the river

8036170 i really enjoyed listening to her in regards to telling us about barack in the ways that we dont see him
8036171 i thought it was a heartfelt speech and she really did a great job talking about her family life
8036172 the purpose was of course to provide a picture of barack obama the husband the father the best friend
8036173 something that looks good on you and something that looks for the occasion if you can combine those two things youve got the essence of style
8036174 the visual is as much of an impact as the verbal
8036175 so its not just what you say its what you look like saying it
8036176 weve seen the hillary pants suits weve seen the laura bush oscar de la renta easter suits they call them so this is really refreshingly different
8036177 ii would have liked to hear a bit more outside of community organizing on what it is that has really driven barack obama to seek public office
8036178 he said that the city had some extremely forward thinking leaders in the 70s that made some decisions that were not popular with the business community at the time but were done to make sure that quality of life for the residents took a major priority because of this the city center swelled with residents and businesses naturally flocked to them and acclimated to the infrastructure that the council put in place of course now its a point of pride and every city in the u s is trying to implement their strategies but most of us are having to come in at the tail end after many vacant lots and abandoned strip centers are left to be somehow reworked into places that people want to be around i wish we had gotten started 10 years earlier but im glad were at least laying the ground work now

8036187 if there were an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misapproriating this administration would take the gold world records we cannot afford another republican administration
8036188 there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against sen obama
8036189 people from all around the country to collaboratively determine the extent to which government managed websites contain the information people need
8036190 oh that looks thought provoking ill give it a try
8036191 this is a very important convention where there is a chance that the next president of the united states will be nominated
8036192 obviously its going to affect different voters in different ways
8036193 if you look at who it will have a major impact on it is primarily democratic voters
8036194 if you dont want nuclear waste here you dont want john mccain here
8036195 i dont mind if they open yucca mountain up for a dump
8036196 somebodys got to store it and the government would pay us lots of money for it i think its time for people to realize that were going to get it sooner or later
8036197 its better off staying right where it is than moving it why would you move something thats so toxic
8036198 we are pleased with the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2009 for several reasons
8036199 we were able to manage dynamic growth while achieving both gross and operating margins at record high levels
8036200 because we supply the global solar power industry with its core equipment and technology gt solar has a unique perspective on macro trends and developments given that perspective we believe that the solar power industry is continuing to make additional progress in lowering costs and bringing solar power closer to parity with more conventional energy sources we therefore remain optimistic about gt solars future and that of the industry as a whole
8036201 because of the bush administrations highly successful propaganda campaigns and a huge media failure in the united states most americans didnt realize until recently how often the bush administration has violated domestic and international law
8036202 much of what we know about the run up to the iraq war has come from whistleblowers its also because of whistleblowers that americans have learned about the prison abuse at abu ghraib warrantless wiretapping in the u s etc the press can make the information so well known that the administration cannot ignore it as soon as cbss 60 minutes broadcast some of the photos from abu ghraib the bush administration was forced to deal with the scandal
8036203 on march 16 the new york times presented a discussion of the iraq war with nine experts on military and foreign affairs all of whom supported george w bushs invasion of iraq
8036204 as fair asked in a march 17 action alert why should the debate over the war be restricted to those who made erroneous predictions about the invasion
8036205 over the course of the iraq war many commentators have pointed out that the pundits and analysts who pushed for the iraq invasion in the first place are still dominant figures in the media debate over the war as if the fact that they were wrong were unimportant or even evidence of their seriousness
8036206 amazingly prescient about the course in iraq they were criticizing internally before they left office
8036207 much of the world considers our statements about iraq as arrogant untruthful and masking a hidden agenda i strongly believe the probable response of many arabs of the region and muslims of the world if the u s enters iraq without unsc united nations security council agreement will result in actions extraordinarily dangerous to america and americans
8036208 a fair study examines all 393 on camera sources appearing in stories about iraq on abc world news tonight cbs evening news nbc nightly news and pbss newshour with jim lehrer beginning one week before and ending one week after colin powells february 5 presentation at the u n the study finds that while war skeptics are rarely seen on the network newscasts 76 percent of all sources were current or former government officials at a time when 61 percent of respondents were telling cbs pollsters they felt the u s should wait and give the united nations and weapons inspectors more time just 6 percent of u s sources were skeptics about the need for war just 3 of 393 sources were identified with anti war activism
8036209 do you all remember scott ritter you know the former chief u n weapons inspector who played chief stooge for saddam hussein
8036210 well mr ritter actually told a french radio network that quote the united states is going to leave baghdad with its tail between its legs defeated sorry scott i think youve been chasing the wrong tail again
8036211 a nation at war outlawed weapons some skeptics say arms hunt is fruitless
8036212 in a major article in the new york times this weekend reporter judith miller admitted she was wrong when she wrote several of the key articles that claimed iraq had an extensive weapons of mass destruction program ahead of the 2003 invasion
8036213 today we are joined by someone who was not wrong about weapons of mass destruction in iraq scott ritter
8036214 he was the united nations top weapons inspector in iraq at unscom between 1991 and 1998 before working at the un he served as an officer in the us marines and as a ballistic missile adviser to general schwarzkopf in the first gulf war scott ritter has just published a new book titled iraq confidential the untold story of the intelligence conspiracy to undermine the un and overthrow saddam hussein the book details how the cia manipulated and sabotaged the work of un departments to achieve the foreign policy agenda of the united states in the middle east
8036215 with this new data the predicted fastest 100 meter time would probably go down a little bit
8036216 the record then was about 9 79 and the model predicted these crazy times that by 2009 itd be down in the high 9 6s
8036217 i thought thats crazy its not going to progress that fast every day that i think about that i kick myself thats my penitence for doubting the numbers
8036218 predicting it is fine for the sake of kicks but its not a scientifically valid approach
8036219 you have to assume that everything that has happened in the past will continue in the future
8036220 typically when you get someone that big they cant start
8036221 we dont really know what the best form is and maybe bolt is redefining that and showing us we missed something
8036222 the limits will be largely set by the rules of the ioc
8036223 its kind of an arms race with the regulators of the sport and the people trying to push the technology to the limits at some point here there must be a d tente where technology cant push us any further and the rules will restrict it

8036228 i dont care if hes polka dot as long as he can get us out of this mess
8036229 my mother shes 85 years old im sorry to say but she will not vote for him
8036230 weve been talking with staff in different parts of the midwest
8036231 and were all struggling to some extent with the problem of white workers who will not vote for obama because of his color there is no question about it its a very powerful thing to get over for some folks
8036232 but i tell people are we supposed to be afraid of that and not go ahead and try to do something different
8036233 there are people who want to hurt barack obama because of his race and sometimes i fear for his safety
8036234 the department of homeland security s immigration and customs enforcement confirmed 350 people suspected as being illegal immigrants working at howard industries were found during a raid monday
8036235 a series of preparations by immigration and customs enforcement on the gulf coast has local advocates on edge about the possibility of yet another worksite raid
8036236 bill chandler the executive director of the alliance said the group is now
8036237 was a significant escalation of the bush administrations enforcement practices because those detained were not simply deported as in previous raids but were imprisoned for months on criminal charges of using false documents
8036238 screenplays such as this are not the way to launch your career as a hollywood director the film runs counter to the rules of commercialism it will probably be laughton s single experience as a director
8036239 its not clear but it appears that the unnamed cabinet member was quite interested in the particular name of our companys product looking back now i can see why its uncanny
8036240 our product was pulled off the shelves in advance of the bush administrations bungling of the name of our product
8036241 is it trademark infringement i guess well find out in court

8036250 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
8036251 saakashvili chose genocide to solve his political tasks the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have more than once spoken in referenda supporting the independence of their republics we understand that after what had happened they have the right to decide their fate themselves
8036252 were not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8036253 of course we dont need that everything depends on the stance of our partners and the world community and our partners in the west
8036254 todays announcement further inflames an already tense situation in the region
8036255 we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow we again call on russia to abide by international law as the basis for resolving this crisis and to implement urgently and in full russias commitments to withdraw forces
8036256 we fear a war and we dont want one if its hot we dont want it
8036257 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation
8036258 i dont think isolation is looming i dont believe this should really be a doomsday scenario i believe common sense should prevail
8036259 some people in the west have been in denial for a long time
8036260 now there can be no more denial the west has to show that this will cost them really cost them you are dealing with bullies here and bullies do not understand the tender message
8036261 this is the most worrying thing at the moment they would be within 20km 12 miles of tbilisi we are in a very precarious situation

8036264 it is my view on the evidence available that the stop and search was not conducted in accordance with the requirements of the terrorism act and as such was unlawful
8036265 if one was less resolved you could probably throw in the towel and forget about it but then i had to think about all the other people including children who are being stopped
8036266 and i thought weve got to make a stand here and im certainly not going to let these people down as far as im concerned

8036283 although the parties could still join forces it leaves open the option of a standoff between liberty simon and westfield
8036284 both groups have now clearly pulled up a seat at the table
8036285 they could be either working together and looking to divide up the assets or the move by westfield could be a defensive move to try and keep new entrants out of this market
8036286 takeovers in this sector are driven by investors who believe that the net asset value is understated not the share price

8036293 on friday august 31 2001 the sunshine seemed to dim laughter faded away and there was a little less joy in the world because deputy hagop jake kuredjian was taken from us a deranged man wielding a rifle took his life in a brief moment of time leaving his family and an army of friends to mourn his loss in the short time since his tragic death at 40 years old i have been overwhelmed by the stories of how much life jake packed into the relatively short time he was with us if friends were counted as income jake was one of the richest men in the world while we cant help but grieve his passing i am determined to remember that million dollar smile and the fact he would give the shirt off his back to help a family member friend or stranger let us remember jake enjoying a good prank telling a joke or riding down the road on his harley please never forget that jake willingly put his life at risk to come to the aid of residents and law enforcement personnel who were in peril most of all if you have not already done so thank god for sharing jake with us even if just for a little while

8036300 50 billion to 65 billion a year when fully phased in

8036321 we have to improve at everything set pieces and open play we had a bad game the best thing was the result but this time we have to play better and we have to score goals but i wasnt surprised by them i was surprised at how badly we played we have a lot of confidence that we will go through we are at anfield and we have to improve and we will improve
8036322 microsoft and oracle continue to make advancements in certain faster growing areas

8036332 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8036333 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8036334 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8036335 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8036336 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8036337 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8036338 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8036339 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8036340 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8036341 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8036342 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8036343 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8036344 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8036345 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8036346 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8036347 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8036348 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8036349 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8036350 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8036351 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8036352 gigantic penny was a bonus to a long personal journey
8036353 this is the game and i think its important to keep perspective said hammon back at practice with the wnbas san antonio silver stars on tuesday
8036354 and if this is the toughest thing i have to face in life i think ill have a very easy life theres bound to be more peaks and valleys along the way and but i think this has helped prepare me for those peaks and valleys that ill face further in life
8036355 my goal in all this was never to get the approval of everybody hammon said
8036356 i think its very easy for a lot of people to sit back and say i would have done this or i would have done that i think if you went and asked people a bunch of my peers if theyd do the same thing i think a lot of them would say yes
8036357 the medal will collect dust just like any other piece of hardware hammon said
8036358 its about the journey that youve gone on for me the medal was nice and like i said it was unbelievable just to be on that podium but its been about the journey to get there
8036359 i love my country i love what we stand for
8036360 people think im apple pie and hot dogs and hamburgers and cheeseburgers on the fourth of july but played for americas one time cold war enemy
8036361 our coaches go and coach over in other countries for the olympics
8036362 so i just dont think people were aware of that so what better way to tell them than this little girl from south dakota
8036363 it was good to see my teammates and see my coaches
8036364 they were hitting me with e mails and texts all the time when i was over there for me those are the things that carried me through
8036365 it was based on our research and discussions weve had with fans
8036366 public financing is going to be less and less a factor in building new stadiums and arenas and it certainly was the case with us johnson said
8036367 monumental development for the franchise the jets then known as the new york titans started at the polo grounds in 1960 then played at shea stadium and giants stadium where they will play for the 2008 and 2009 seasons
8036368 this is a team thats never had its own home he said
8036369 the concept of having a home field is a major concept i dont think theres anything including super bowl iii that matches the impact that this building will have
8036370 i still dont know how its going to feel swinging longoria said before a game against toronto on tuesday night
8036371 im being a little tentative to do so im going to give it a couple more days its definitely taken some good steps forward in the past week a lot less pain in the last week
8036372 there will be flight delays it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8036373 ill bite my tongue to say they visitors to the bus like it but they find it interesting
8036374 my experience in wichita was nothing but a pleasurable one for both me and my wife jennifer and i look forward to remaining a part of the community
8036375 i know kash really really well and thats why i went to play there
8036376 it takes a special type of player to play for kash i guess they kind of thought they wanted to go in a different direction
8036377 ive had three or four confrontations with umpires that were better than that people see a clip all over the country of me getting in an umpires grill and they dont know what led up to it it was simply another way to motivate your ballclub
8036378 but as a coach with his body language and stuff like that people didn t like that i think kash was a great coach but sometimes his body language was a little bad at times
8036379 one of the most difficult things ive ever had to do
8036380 kash is a friend of mine and will be a friend of mine for the rest of my life
8036381 hes a guy you want to go out to dinner with a guy you want to go golfing with a guy you want to have a beer with hes a friend hes a very well spoken person and i would definitely say his passion for the game of baseball and his will and want to win are right in line with mine
8036382 its like man what was i doing last year ive watched my highlight tape i look at things and im like got it i come in here and try to repeat it sometimes it happens sometimes it doesnt
8036383 last year id go into the game and i was able to repeat it over and over and over and over and over this year i just havent been able to repeat it over and over and over and over and over and over thats the only difference
8036384 the body language doesnt say that im busting my back jimmy doesnt sense i dont think that the guys are starting to get upset with him
8036385 if you cant get up emotionally and mentally when youre two or three games out of first place you need to find another job another occupation
8036386 hey do you have a crap cannon can i take a picture of it for my blog
8036387 on the road to the whitehouse this atypical candidate is going to require a fresh approach
8036388 the juices are flowing just because the first game is coming romo said tuesday before the cowboys last full practice until next week
8036389 yeah i thought we had a really good preseason were excited about our execution
8036390 we came out and we got into training camp at the beginning it was the best the offense has started for us at camp romo said
8036391 usually the defense is far and away ahead but having the guys that we had at certain positions we were able to kind of pick up where we left off and go from there and it was important to get that feeling of confidence
8036392 hadnt decided how much everybody will play against the vikings
8036393 actually this might be the easiest week for a lot of guys terrell owens said
8036394 this is obviously an opportunity for all of us especially for the starters and the guys who are going to go into the season full steam ahead to kind of get our legs back get refreshed and then be ready to go next week
8036395 last year we came out of the gate pretty good in that first game romo said
8036396 were a pretty veteran group experienced especially offensive i think well be ok
8036397 at one point i argued with the decision but i am still about three weeks away tyree said
8036398 i have been running routes and i have not had any drawbacks which is good
8036399 its going to be a whole different season coffee said
8036400 i dont like talking about it but theres going to be things that i plan to do that ive never done on a college level
8036401 yall will see its going to be a whole other season
8036402 glen coffee is mr consistency for us in terms of being able to do just about everything whether its being a good receiver being a good blocker and being decent when he has the ball in his hands saban said
8036403 mark ingram has probably been the surprise of all the young players in terms of his maturity as a player saban said
8036404 hes elusive he has speed but he has power and tremendous toughness and hes a good receiver hes a very very good all around guy
8036405 we dont have a third down back in that bunch saban said
8036406 we feel like several of those guys can play that role and we certainly need to figure out ways to use that group
8036407 third and 2 is just as important as a 50 yard gain when it comes down to it
8036408 but i will be tuning in after the game and i will find out what they rushed for so i cant lie about that
8036409 when i make a name for myself it means im doing something to help the team win im bettering the team coffee said
8036410 when we do good individually the team does better also i plan to do something i dont know what i might get carries i might not get carries but whatever i get im going to work my hardest
8036411 if you dont like it change it dont complain about it it wont get you anywhere except annoy the people around you
8036412 they are already there why would the industry need me

8036417 we came out of camp real healthy usc coach pete carroll said tuesday pointing to cornerback shareece wright as the only key player whose status for saturdays game at virginia seems uncertain
8036418 for the sake of the kids knock on wood we can keep that going and keep these guys able to play camp was very physical and very aggressive and the guys were able to handle it we were in great shape to handle the workload and its showed up and paid off for us so hopefully well continue
8036419 hes had a couple good days under his belt his knee is still a little bit swollen and kind of black and blue but hes not in any serious pain at all hes managed very well
8036420 he was at full speed and was on a mission to prove that he was full speed hes not missing this game we all thought he was in big big trouble but he just wouldnt hear of it
8036421 im playing im practicing every day he said im ready to go
8036422 it was definitely a frustrating experience i learned a lot about medicine how it works it was scary at times i had a real high fever bad stuff i was on antibiotics for 10 days they said that should kill the bacterial infection they werent letting me do anything
8036423 it seems like were extremely healthy added byers a fifth year senior
8036424 i cant remember going into the opener with the team pretty much intact luck helped
8036425 its a big time football game we expect its going to be a very difficult game were holding nothing back were not resting anybody and were not going to get somebody ready for a couple weeks from now were going for it and thats the only way we know how to do it
8036426 we have a lot of similarities they are a a pretty classic as i would see it classic run and play action team its an nfl offense is what it is and an nfl 3 4 defense that al groh brought from his years in the league
8036427 coach grohs team looks a lot like the patriots the jets teams he was a part of carroll said
8036428 the liberals can understand everything but people who dont understand them
8036429 it was a nation fulfilled prophecy it is what the us has long dreamed of hoped for and desired
8036430 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
8036431 my friends we have reached a crisis the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
8036432 the elite ruling class should have realized too that all along what needed to be contained was their misguided nation fulfilling prophecy to entrap and destroy russia
8036433 moscow wanted to send a message if you provoke us we will find ways to retaliate
8036434 to encourage belgrade and pristina to resume talks within the framework of international law
8036435 reach an agreement on all problems of that serbian territory
8036436 its stupid rules that somebody made in i dont know 1850 and now they give me problems with these things the still perturbed safin said
8036437 ive already been on tour 10 years and i want to enjoy my tennis he said
8036438 i dont want to fight anybody i dont want to face any problems on the court its not like im starving to death and i need to do something original to earn money i want to enjoy its so simple
8036439 i just want to have a nice match win or lose and whatever happens go home thats it i dont want to face the foot faults and all these things
8036440 i would behave like a baby and crying and all this
8036441 he was always come on you have to grow up in your mind you cannot behave like this thats why hes like learn from my experience dont do this
8036442 i think if she will do everything opposite of what ive been doing throughout the years she will be number one in the world for a long time safin said
8036443 two tough finals and i think the third one is here she should take her chance i think she is ready to win the first grand slam im really proud of the way shes handling the pressure and the way shes handling herself
8036444 i just dont play well here i just dont play aggressive enough just in general i either just dont rise to the occasion or maybe the pressure gets to me
8036445 today i was more offensive than i usually am so i think thats why i displayed some positive play i dont know im not in the final 8 club i have to try mixed doubles or something
8036446 yeah i think i can have the whole next year free she said after struggling to a 6 1 4 6 6 4 victory over vera dushevina on tuesday
8036447 im a very big competitor so obviously i want myself to win she said
8036448 at the moment thats a lot to ask for i just want to take it match by match i have good potential to slowly get into a tournament and play fresh
8036449 i try not to let those kind of doubts get into it blake said
8036450 you think more about the fact that anything can happen not that its not your night or youre thinking about losing
8036451 my guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations

8036481 im going over here to try to make myself a better racecar driver sorenson said during a conference call tuesday shortly after the announcement
8036482 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have some more opportunities to win races and things like that
8036483 it seems like this year it has been the worst year out of the three so i guess you could say that probably factored in on things like that said sorenson who plans to finish out the season with ganassi
8036484 i felt like ive done everything i can with the situation im in now he said
8036485 like i said it just seems like this last year it got a little bit worse as far as not being able to find some speed at some of these places
8036486 it seems like they are definitely on an uphill climb towards the top sorenson said
8036487 they have definitely made progress its a team that i think will be here for a long time and seems to be heading in the right direction to win races

8036492 but i feel like it went fairly well im not too sure how good those types of things can go but i think its ok
8036493 i think everybody kind of tried to pull together and tried to make sure that nobody was pointing fingers or anything like that sorenson said
8036494 its obviously not a fun process to go through thats for sure having the extra pressure on you sorenson said
8036495 but at the same time long term wise i feel like this is where i want to be

8036516 i wondered whether that question would come up a frisky paterno said after his weekly news conference started with a question about the quarterback race
8036517 its working out you dont have to be a genius to figure out that clark was the guy who should be the guy who developed to be number one paterno said
8036518 we have a fluid situation we have a nice situation paterno said
8036519 i still dont want to go into the season where you have a two quarterback or three quarterback system he said
8036520 i think clark ought to go in there and have a little fun playing

8036522 ping out of youth baseball and the broken bat out of the national pastime while making the game a little safer with every swing
8036523 we want this to be true to the game of baseball dill said
8036524 we dont want our bat to suddenly change the parameters of the game we want to fit comfortably in those parameters and i think we will
8036525 i accepted i was not major league caliber at that point the 55 year old said
8036526 the result is that it is very strong and as a result of it being strong it is very safe dill said
8036527 it is impossible for this maple bat to shatter in the way the maple bats shatter in the major leagues today you will never have a barrel separating from the handle the worst thing that can happen is a crack there is a never a catastrophic break
8036528 the difference between a catastrophic injury and a bruise is a just little movement dill said
8036529 i liked it it felt great said ed koeffling of pennsville a montclair state university outfielder
8036530 i liked the handle usually bats like that break easy this felt pretty durable
8036531 all the normal things that happen with bats will happen with this bat dill said
8036532 if you hit a ball on the sweet spot of this bat and the sweet spot of a traditional bat the ball will go equally far
8036533 i cant put a price on the safety of the children said montclair councilman rick murnick who attended news conference with his son
8036534 i dont know the particulars of what it costs if it works well find a way to make it work in montclair
8036535 it sounds like it is supposed to any wood bat is better to me than the ping of the aluminum bat he said
8036536 you watch the college world series and hear that ping and to me it is not baseball
8036537 so many bats are broken every game especially when mariano rivera is pitching pepe said of the new york yankees great reliever
8036538 that would be the true test let him pitch and try to break that bat
8036539 energy stocks the only way a human is going to make any money
8036540 instead of an air conditioned room with rows of batteries on raised floors periodically used to provide emergency back up capstones upsource secure power product uses multiple highly reliable natural gas fueled microturbines that provide continuous power independent of the electric utility
8036541 the turbines offer digital power electronics that deliver quality power and can be placed outside which means no extra construction costs and easy access
8036542 on average secure power is 20 percent less expensive than traditional ups in n 1 requirements cost savings come from secure powers extremely low maintenance and operational costs natural gas is less expensive to use in day to day operations than utility electricity and secure powers 100 percent up time means more production time

8036555 iowa casts sixty six votes for the next president of the united states barack obama
8036556 hey you know this voting shit is potentially ambarrasing cause we might not win which is of course racist so how can we get around it
8036557 the great state of california casts 400 or whatever the number votes for hillary clinton
8036558 the great state of california casts 400 or whatever the number votes for hillary clinton
8036559 our approach allows investors to obtain the very same benefits as they would with a hedge fund without the limitations usually associated with hedge funds
8036560 we use an investment philosophy similar to global tactical asset allocation that attempts to exploit short term market inefficiencies by taking positions in various markets with a view to profiting from relative movements across those markets
8036561 the approach focuses on general movements in the markets rather than on performance of individual securities within them positions are generally taken with a relatively short term time horizon of three to six months hence the term tactical asset allocation and in markets across the globe hence global
8036562 the latest annual rate of inflation measured from last july to this july was 5 6 the largest annual gain since way back in january 1991
8036563 this is a great way to buy a diversified portfolio of inflation adjusted treasuries and track them quite easily

8036571 so you cross the rumble strip get a little vibration it makes you look up when you look up you see the sign
8036572 it is the newest approach and i actually believe its working and its relatively inexpensive
8036573 weve completed 10 neighborhoods and we have 9 in the process right now
8036574 well send enforcement there until a time where well see drivers slowing down and then well reassign to a different street and neighborhood
8036575 about 16 percent of all the individuals that were stopped and cited for speeding or traffic violations in this enforcement zone are actually residents of that neighborhood
8036576 i believe that were making a positive impact on modifying traffic behavior to where it benefits the residents at the same time keeping the motorist safe
8036577 you know its all about the kids in our area its our future and we want to try and preserve it as much as we can
8036578 the reporter was actually in town during court in november going on he read articles on it and found it interesting
8036579 theres just no reason why his life should have been taken
8036580 he was such a good man he enjoyed life what he was doing as a police officer there is no reason why he shouldnt be here
8036581 without a doubt my husband was murdered and marty carson is responsible for that it wasnt an accident
8036582 i think the only thing that will help in the healing process is to see marty prosecuted for what hes done
8036583 he did something wrong and shouldnt get away with that
8036584 kate does not know the plaintiffs and has never met with them or spoken with them her representatives believe that the claims are baseless and without merit and they intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit
8036585 one of the nice things about having the break between the image series and the new series is that it really gave me time to nail down where the story is headed
8036586 i have the next couple arcs already plotted and i think fans of the book will really dig where things are going
8036587 william harms has managed to put a truly unique spin on the vampire story by taking vlad the impaler and making him a vampire hunter
8036588 this trade collection gives birth to this original idea but the upcoming ongoing series from harms and matt timson will really keep you up at night
8036589 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
8036590 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
8036591 i probably could have gone back into the game if really pressed into it
8036592 had it been a regular season game he might have come back once he knew i think he would have tried anyway and hes still sore so well hold him out for a little while
8036593 we havent really gone over that it is such a short week and it is preseason id like to play but that is coachs call
8036594 i would be doubtful in that regard but i wouldnt rule it out
8036595 she started yelling her name and i said that i will go inside to get her and she said i couldnt do that i didnt say anything when i went inside
8036596 i lay my life down for somebody and now i know my son will do the same thing makes you feel good makes you feel real good real proud

8036599 it gives me one solid meal a day i just have snacks or soup the rest of the day
8036600 a lot dont know what they are going to do how they will get by i dont think they will know until it happens its going to be a rough winter for a lot of people
8036601 i think we will see an increase in our numbers going up more phone calls are coming in from people running out of fuel at that time youll see more phone calls coming into the office of the aging and myself the increase for meals on wheels will be an issue
8036602 butter was 12 31 a year ago and now its 29 21 big increases in pasta flower cereal chicken used to be 19 00 a case now its 27 00
8036603 not a good year for independents or third party candidates
8036604 because he doesnt have as much money it seems he doesnt have as much support that will make other contributors give less or contribute less to the campaign so it has a downward spiral effect
8036605 our campaign is operating like a vermont family we go week by week and look at our expenses look at how we can make ends meet and move forward
8036606 people dont want to know how much money i have they want to know how ill create jobs for them
8036607 we will comply with the law we want the law clarified we are told there are a couple of options making the money loans or transferring to spouse or partner i dont expect us to be returning money quite honestly
8036608 we have a number of different school zones within the city that we will be taking it to probably on a daily basis just getting it out there and getting people aware of their speeds and hopefully getting everybody slowed down and get to the school safe
8036609 in fact ive even written one im trying to peddle
8036610 i was trained and groomed practically from birth my dad has me on a miniature two wheeler at 18 months on stilts at 26 months and in his acts at age 3
8036611 i had a friend ask me one time how come i have so many friends how come so many people like me and i told him i make it obvious that i like them
8036612 make sure they understand what the sex offenders are required to do for example offenders must verify their address every year and let the sex offender registry know every time they move we also want them to know how to use our special law enforcement database so they can track sex offenders better
8036613 so obviously theres significant disagreement in the jury room and theyre working very hard to try to come to some kind of consensus on it
8036614 and so coming to a consensus when youve got such polarization can be very difficult but if theyre still going at it after 13 hours or so then theyre working very hard on it and its to their credit certainly that they havent just given up and said we cant make a decision in which case there would be a mistrial and theyd have to do it all over again
8036615 is a glowing tribute to all of the parties involved including the regulatory bodies as well as the faculty and new leadership team
8036616 we are grateful for the hard work and cooperation of all of the important myers university stakeholders including the dedicated faculty administrators and overseers for an institution of higher learning in a mere 90 days to progress from nearly closing to a complete change of ownership is i believe unprecedented it would not have happened without truly dedicated and talented people
8036617 since may 20 2008 when the investor group first became involved with the university the existing myers university has been reorganized to enhance productivity with the implementation of efficient and effective processes
8036618 we are very pleased that myers faculty and staff have welcomed us with open arms and have taken an active role in moving the university forward
8036619 without the support of the faculty and staff we would not have gotten this far in this short amount of time myers has some truly awesome employees who are dedicated to the students
8036620 my colleagues and i are confident that under the guidance of dr scott as provost myers will reclaim its rightful place as a pioneer in the post secondary education arena in northeastern ohio and beyond
8036621 now myers can continue to provide students with superior degrees that will make them highly sought after for meaningful job placement in cleveland
8036622 we are thankful for the confidence current and returning students have with the new leadership we have seen many students who have been away from myers return when they heard about and met the new leadership meeting with students addressing their concerns and assisting them with their issues has been my priority
8036623 we are seeking partnerships in cleveland with groups like the cleveland clinic the fbi rock and roll hall of fame high school districts and others to help offer custom degrees for the career placement
8036624 we are eager to help students realize their dreams by obtaining a quality education we are willing to explore every option to provide needed assistance to students and to the companies that reimburse tuition
8036625 within a very short period of time significant initiatives have been taken to ensure not only that current students will be able to finish their programs but also to establish a long term strategic plan to secure the stability and effectiveness of myers university with the highest moral academic and business integrity
8036626 it is one of the blessings of old friends that you can afford to be stupid with them

8036630 its more of a problem for the malls when people try to take the attitude of well theres lot of businesses here lots of parking spaces no one is gonna miss just one but i think with a business like ours a small business with just one parking lot people are respectful of that

8036639 while we are extremely pleased with the results obtained from the work undertaken to date on our three marketed and seven pipeline drugs four of which are moving towards commercial release we feel this success is not yet represented in shareholder value
8036640 we have invested heavily in the respective successful development of our products now we need assistance in developing our companys share valuation
8036641 we have therefore retained cb capital partners as our financial advisor to assist in reviewing our strategic alternatives with the objective of maximizing shareholder value and we look forward to working with them to ensure that all alternatives available to the company are considered and evaluated to achieve that objective
8036642 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy

8036645 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that

8036647 now we know hes not just on vacation hes living there
8036648 through some good police work we were able to figure out where he was
8036649 make sure the offender is where hes supposed to be face to face talk to them let them know this is not free time that theyre going to be checked on
8036650 i look for the cheapest one first and if they dont have it or its got a lot of artificial stuff in it i dont buy it but i do look to see if i can get that wegmans store brand
8036651 i actually prefer a lot of the wegmans brand stuff theres a few things i buy here and there with brand names but as far as pastas vegetables like the frozen ones i buy all the wegmans brand stuff
8036652 when you buy a brand of wegmans cereal youre paying just for the quality of the product and packaging if youre buying national brands we all know the national brand we see commercials on tv all the time theres a lot of added costs that are in there in a national brand

8036663 although they have two of the leagues best young front seven players in de mario williams and mlb demeco ryans the texans consistently have struggled to pressure opposing quarterbacks they finished 25th in the league in qb sack percentage last season and things havent been much better this year with just one sack through two exhibition contests
8036664 one of their plans to improve the pass rush was to convert free agent acquisition rosevelt colvin from linebacker to defensive end but from what we hear that experiment hasnt gone well thus far colvin who missed five games in 07 with a foot injury has been playing linebacker in the pros for nine seasons and isnt picking up his new position very quickly
8036665 another one of houstons hopes is to get more pressure from second year dt amobi okoye okoye had 5 sacks last season as a rookie before hitting a wall down the stretch of course theyll need williams to keep up his dominant play from last season when he recorded 14 sacks to stand any chance of improving in this facet of the game were told that colvin could be the guy to get them over the hump if only he could learn the nuances of playing the de spot

8036675 my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer after treatment began we found out that the insurance company had a small loophole under our insurance they have a 13 000 limit per year on radiation and chemotherapy that amount did not even cover the first treatment of either radiation or chemo

8036743 how many of you girls want to come with me
8036744 this question annoys me no end i always sputter that the songs arent a diary a blog or a therapy session ive never had a fact checker come in to go over my lyrics i havent worked through all my childhood issues and achieved enlightenment through songwriting i can write whatever i want and im the only one who knows what is indeed fact or at least my version of fact you see the problem and what is poetic license
8036745 the challenge was what do you do with this thing
8036746 we went out into these beech woods out of the corner of my eye i saw a figure appear in a peaked cap and with two dogs he had come from the village and was in charge of negotiating the sale of the trees it was peculiar
8036747 mozart there was a poetic unity about it and the tree was cut down at a particular point in the moons cycle its an unmodern story

8036749 these awards pay tribute to those organizations and individuals making significant and important contributions to the corporate compliance and business ethics profession

8036751 the scce 4th annual international compliance and ethics award recipients are recognized by their peers as pioneers and leaders in the compliance and ethics profession
8036752 we are grateful for the work each of these organizations and individuals have done and will continue to do to help advance the compliance and ethics profession their work speaks for itself
8036753 we are worse off than we were four years ago
8036754 these are the soul trying times our forebearers spoke of when the ease of complacency and self interest must give way this was true for those who went to lexington and concord it was true for those who lie buried at gettysburg it was true for those who built democracys arsenal to vanquish fascism

8036759 thats what youve been elected for you figure it out
8036760 what we have is a male dominated abc1 product with an 18 to 34 year old demographic that is very attractive to advertisers
8036761 first and foremost is the demographic of the audience which had previously been underestimated by the market because the station used to be seen as downmarket
8036762 it means we can package them together for national advertisers and also sell at a local level to local retailers
8036763 anybody in this environment has to be cautious about ad revenues going forward
8036764 economic conditions are such that it would be foolish to predict a significant improvement in the near future
8036765 are we likely to build a cpu and take out intel

8036769 commodity demand in china is not olympics driven or beijing driven but a vast structural shift reflecting urbanisation and industrialisation of hundreds of millions of people across every province in the country
8036770 rio tinto has had strong results and last week we had strong results so we have all stayed where we are and the relative contributions in putting the two companies together remains the same
8036771 our position with respect to bhp remains unchanged the business has very strong momentum and excellent growth prospects
8036772 in the first half of the year the newspaper industry has seen publishing advertising revenues decline around 15 per cent and i can tell you it hasnt gotten any better in july or august
8036773 investors will await more news on potential competition from china given the noise generated in the uk and indian media over sinopecs interest in imperial energy market participants will likely wait for a bidding war to emerge between ongc and sinopec
8036774 an approach which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company
8036775 the group has taken decisive action in response to the toughest period of trading it has experienced in its time as a public company
8036776 foreseeable future with continued poor mortgage liquidity limiting housing market activity
8036777 you cant get a mortgage to support your transaction you are not going to get off the starting blocks
8036778 one possible way of looking at this is that simon propertys stake is not a short term transaction and may eventually result in a takeover bid
8036779 it may be that as a result other shopping centre players such as westfield consider building a stake too
8036780 not much detail is known but the stake building underpins our view that uk property stocks own generally high quality assets with long term value creation prospects
8036781 needs a new strategy and simon properties move may fit in this
8036782 this is the first step in an improvement in housing there are some signs the worst has passed us and thats the best we could say for now
8036783 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level depending on where you focus you can see some different stories on where home prices are headed
8036784 its a business led by consumer demand and as consumer spending power has weakened amtraks business has suffered
8036785 we think best buy of all consumer electronics retailers is best placed to judge that the industry has moved on it doesnt need to acquire extensive underperforming store chains when an increasing amount of demand is moving online
8036786 from a technical analysis perspective in the short term i think the ftse will trade in the 5 300 5 500 range
8036787 after the recent share price rally the stock is trading well above our reduced target price of 212p thus we reduce our rating to sell
8036788 we believe that given good relations between the indian and russian governments any necessary approvals ought to be granted
8036789 given the possibility of ongc coming to the market to acquire imperial shares and the possibility of a counter bid from sinopec which could potentially see ongc increase its offer to 1 500p
8036790 we first recommended batm at 35p in february this year with a price target of 60p given these strong half year earnings and developments into new geographical markets eastern europe and new verticals medical and security we raise our 12 month price target from 60p to 80p based on an increase in full year eps estimate from 3p to 4p
8036791 at 56p the stock trades at 11 9 times our 2008 earnings per share before amortisation of acquired intangibles this represents a c50 per cent discount to arm and a c30 per cent discount to spirent
8036792 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july
8036793 it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently
8036794 this still leaves approvals at a record low down around 70 per cent from the peak in late 2006
8036795 but the bba data for july offers some evidence that a bottom is appearing in the market after the extraordinary slide in activity
8036796 we continue to anticipate a modest recovery in house purchase activity in the second half but the still very low level of approvals points to falling house prices we currently expect an 18 per cent drop by year end and a further 9 per cent decline by the end of 2009
8036797 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for buy to let landlords as it is for other borrowers however we expect the rental market to remain underpinned by strong demand partly because some people who would like to buy a home are being forced to carry on renting for now
8036798 savvy investors are waiting until the bottom of the market has been reached before extending their portfolios i would expect to see an increase in activity again towards the end of next year when they feel there are bargains to be had
8036799 the bomberman franchise is one of hudson entertainments most popular

8036803 he said oh well im sure that was a complete waste of time
8036804 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8036805 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8036806 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8036807 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8036808 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8036809 i think we have a plan for the first time
8036810 he told me get a plan and let me see what i can do
8036811 if we can close it one day and start replacing the cables the next id be all for it

8036818 but if you are in charge of that black box i worry about that
8036819 i was in a confrontation with him and he was quick to explode
8036820 william bennett the former education secretary the prominent conservative who came very close to endorsing you a few days ago called some of your comments irresponsible and intemperate he talks about an emerging pattern with you in which and this is a quote
8036821 you portray those with whom you disagree as not just wrong but wicked
8036822 our demonstration of the environmental sensitivity of alpine lake ecosystems highlights both their vulnerability and usefulness as indicators of the effects of global warming and the predicted increases in climatic variability
8036823 the climate regime in the 2000s altered the character and the function of high elevation aquatic ecosystem
8036824 forecasts of increased temperature and climatic variability in the future pose serious ramifications for both the biodiversity and ecosystem function of high elevation lakes
8036825 debris piled up against the fence including in drainage gates designed to prevent flooding and the 6 foot deep fence foundation stopped subsurface water flow
8036826 by tearing up his check for obama he basically wrote one to mccain
8036827 i openly no flamingly endorse obama whether he says hes for gay marriage or not i know under obama it will only be a matter of time until the country sees the legalization of gay marriage
8036828 for our gay lesbian bisxexual transgender rights to continue to grow and not further diminish then we need to stand behind obama good luck with your life mr colichman i hope you get to sleep well at night after mccain becomes elected shame on you
8036829 it may mean more public spending but it doesnt necessarily mean a windfall tax there are other ways of being able to provide the money for this energy action
8036830 the only stick they energy firms will understand is a windfall tax i have no problem with companies making profits these are excessive profits these are immoral profits it isnt good enough and we have got to take action now
8036831 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts that would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
8036832 asda has even run out of toy gold medals as youngsters up and down the uk are inspired to recreate the team gbs olympic glory
8036833 we saw growing interest in mobile access to the internet as people wanted to stay constantly in touch with results and the medal table
8036834 were excited about the prospects for 2012 obviously because of the location and the feelgood factor it will bring but also because of viewing times
8036835 we expect the 2012 olympics to have a huge impact on the amount of people getting interested in sports and sports nutrition to improve performance our fully trained store associates will all be providing customers with information on the supplements they need to perform for their chosen sport whether it is their daily jog around the park or a more intensive fitness programme
8036836 we find that most sporting events have an effect on sales at comet

8036845 milagros es de una inocencia que da miedo se aferra a la vida brutal e impulsivamente todo lo disfruta por eso se queda todos esos objetos que encuentra como barrendera no como una urraca sino por su significado emocional

8036855 as if new york wasnt stimulating enough already the city has provided a new kind of thrill right in the heart of midtown an esplanade carved into broadway where people can sit and relax as cars and trucks whiz by
8036856 although broadway has been narrowed the flow of traffic on monday did not seem to be noticeably tangled as a result of the recent changes
8036857 janette sadik khan the transportation commissioner has said that traffic patterns might shift and that there was enough capacity on other nearby avenues for drivers
8036858 with these six guys you are as safe as being in your mothers arms
8036859 when you have an umpire running out trying to see a ball 300 or 400 feet away it was impossible
8036860 i think to wait until the postseason that struck me as awkward

8036862 normally wed be looking for silage effluent or slurry but theres absolutely no smell or anything off this
8036863 chris hoy is now scotlands most successful ever olympian and everyone in edinburgh is immensely proud of him
8036864 watching him power to victory three times in beijing was truly inspirational and the citys open top bus parade gives as many people as possible the chance to join in the celebrations
8036865 i hope that many people will attend and im sure that edinburgh will give all of the winning medallists a fantastic welcome home
8036866 it is a victory for thousands bringing overwhelming relief to desperate people across the country
8036867 finally the torment faced by elderly people forced to either spend their life savings on private treatment or go blind is over
8036868 that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8036869 ensuring that returning officers remain independent and are reinforced with the leadership support and direction of the chair of an election management board would build on the strengths of the current system
8036870 our proposal is designed to allow local returning officers to continue to respond to local circumstances while ensuring that there is a consistently high standard of service for all electors across the uk
8036871 the 2007 elections in scotland brought the shortcomings of the current system into sharp focus
8036872 the recommendations in this report are based on the findings of the gould report and the lessons we have learned from the 2007 elections including the importance of ensuring that electoral law is finalised six months before an election
8036873 we are disappointed that the electoral commission does not support the view of the scottish parliament that the conduct of elections in scotland should be the responsibility of holyrood in order to ensure a much higher degree of accountability for their efficient organisation and conduct
8036874 we will of course consider all of the commissions proposals in detail

8036879 il pd deve dialogare con la maggioranza se non vuole essere fagocitato da di pietro
8036880 si tratta dellultimo passo di una serie di cadute nella cronaca rosa e nel gossip
8036881 quasi che la nostra campionessa volesse rivaleggiare con laure manaudou ex compagna di luca marin ora legato lei non in piscina ma sul piano dellimmagine sexy e delle notizie choccanti una scelta discutibile per una atleta che corre il rischio come la sua collega francese di perdere il filo della concentrazione e della preparazione
8036882 sono fiera del mio piercing al seno e lo rifarei senza pensarci su
8036883 da qualche mese pensavo a un piercing mi piaceva lidea ma non sul naso sulla lingua o sul sopracciglio banale ormai ce lhanno un sacco di miei coetanei
8036884 il capezzolo era quello che ci voleva per fare una cosa trasgressiva
8036885 sono vanitosa e adoro guardare allo specchio queste decorazioni che caratterizzano il mio corpo
8036886 pensavo facesse molto pi male dato che si tratta di una zona delicata
8036887 print doesnt mean to people what it used to it may be
8036888 let me just give you a couple of examples anecdotes from women ive talked to
8036889 some of my friends who are democrat voters have expressed concern over the experience angle with obama you know
8036890 we have never wavered in our enthusiasm and our commitment we are absolutely committed to make this work
8036891 they gave us 60 days to comply which was a good fair amount of time
8036892 the national fire protection association decided we really dont like that term grandfathered this is about life safety we want your buildings to be safe for the people who come to it
8036893 if they are not comfortable or they have a fear of fire we absolutely positively want them to get out of the building and call 911
8036894 they have not been back yet but were ready for them
8036895 with water levels as low as they are right now its just hopefully going to help us get back some of the water we havent had in a while
8036896 flood stages on these rivers are 21 and 16 feet were nowhere near that right nor our river levels are five feet so were way below anything what could possibly be a flood right now
8036897 we may have some more roads flooding so well keep monitoring those and barricade them just like what we did yesterday until the water recedes
8036898 there was almost a comfort in knowing that i was getting to work with somebody who had been on the original with me and gone through the same experiences
8036899 like okay weve been through the war together already i never even gave any thought to it being awkward i know how much ive grown up since then i would assume that shes grown up the same amount
8036900 i wouldnt be on it in a million years but i wanted to see if she had fun doing it i had so many questions about her kids and her husband too

8036910 en esta situaci n todo depende de nuestros socios en occidente si los occidentales quieren conservar las buenas relaciones con rusia comprender n las razones de nuestra decisi n
8036911 una violaci n directa de numerosas resoluciones de la onu sobre la integridad territorial de georgia resoluciones que han sido aprobadas por la propia rusia
8036912 las acciones de rusia en las ltimas semanas ponen en duda el compromiso de mosc para asegurar la paz y la seguridad en el c ucaso
8036913 firmemente la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia
8036914 no creo que debamos temer el aislamiento no creo que llegue no creo que sea un escenario de juicio final
8036915 no hace que la situaci n sea m s estable
8036916 out of a group of 12 front line soldiers 2 were abkhazian 2 were armenian 1 armenian locally from sukhumi 1 from yerevan who was too young to go fight the good fight in karabakh and the rest were either from the north caucasus or from places like siberia what were they motivated by looting they had been promised houses with tangerine gardens they had been promised cars
8036917 the abkhaz separatists along with their allies were forced by the agreement to hold their advance and heavy bombardment of the city the georgian side was reassured by russia that sukhumi would not be attacked or bombed if the georgian army would complete its withdrawal the georgian troops along with their tanks were evacuated by the russian military ships to the city of poti the city was left without any significant defence a large number of civilians stayed in sukhumi and all schools were re opened on september 1st however abkhaz separatists north caucasian volunteers cossacks and russian special forces attacked sukhumi on september 16 at 8 am this marked the beginning of 12 days non stop fighting around the besieged sukhumi with intense fighting and human loss on both sides georgians who stayed in the city with some weapons were left without any defence from artillery or mechanised units the city was mercilessly bombed by russian air forces and separatist artillery on september 27 the city fell as units of abkhaz russians and confederation of mountain peoples of the caucasus cmpc stormed the house of the government of abkhazia one of the most horrific massacres of this war was waged on the civilian population of sukhumi after its downfall during the storming of the city close to 1 000 people perished as abkhaz formations overran the streets of the city the civilians who were trapped in the city were taken from their houses basements and apartment buildings
8036918 russia realises that no international organisation or group of states can replace our peace keeping efforts in this specific post soviet space
8036919 there are those who say that this is really about russia and the rules of the game for europe writ large for the caspian energy corridor
8036920 he closed the market in ergneti which was an outlet for contraband passing through south ossetia but also a point of sale for agricultural products from the regions of tskhinvali and gori this vast black market constituted in neutral territory a place of precious exchange the only economic integration of a highly divided region since its closure all contact between georgians and ossetians has become more difficult leading to an exacerbation of the alienation between the two sides in tskhinvali as in gori many see this closure as a major mistake in the region
8036921 do you agree that the republic of south ossetia should retain its current status as an independent state and be recognised by the international community
8036922 south ossetia should merge with north ossetia in the russian federation
8036923 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
8036924 this is an unconcealed annexation of these territories which are a part of georgia
8036925 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity this is contrary to obligations that russia has repeatedly taken on in un security council resolutions it does nothing to improve the prospects for peace in the caucasus
8036926 we feel happy we all have tears in our eyes we feel pride for our people
8036927 everything we went through now we are getting our reward
8036928 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
8036929 i hope mikheil saakashvili the president of georgia will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
8036930 at the request of the georgian government these ships will be delivering humanitarian aid to poti
8036931 the uss mcfaul and another us ship will dock in poti on wednesday
8036932 there are georgian forces on one side ossetians on the other yes they are peacekeepers but we are afraid every single night that something will happen the only thing we want is peace i dont care who we are with
8036933 i have never been so optimistic i have never been so engaged i have never been so motivated
8036934 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
8036935 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
8036936 the precedent of kosovo is a terrible precedent which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations developed not over decades but over centuries they have not thought through the results of what they are doing at the end of the day it is a two ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face
8036937 we too would then have to proceed from the view that in order to be respected we must use brute force in other words armed force
8036938 as soon as georgia gets the promise to join nato from washington on the next day the real process to separate these two territories from georgia will begin
8036939 how else are we supposed to defend the rights of the russian passport holders
8036940 why shouldnt russia stand up to us imperialism and its georgian puppet saakashvili
8036941 surely if the people of south ossetia want to unite with north ossetia they should have the right
8036942 russian troops are in georgia just to ensure that the georgian army is disarmed and can no longer attack us
8036943 yes thats nice but we need to do something now
8036944 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8036945 i would say some people thought we were going to die
8036946 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping
8036947 i sent my mum a text i love you and i am going down
8036948 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
8036949 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
8036950 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew deploy their oxygen masks and they cant be making pa announcements while they have their oxygen masks on
8036951 one thing that can happen is that the outflow valve can fail and become open so all the air rushes out
8036952 a hole can appear because some damage was done which nobody notices and because of the constant stress of pressurising and depressurising the cabin it becomes bigger over time
8036953 what we had in these cases was jet jockeys deciding i am better than ryanair sops standard operating procedures we dont want anybody doing that
8036954 it has the youngest fleet of aircraft in europe and their maintenance organisation is first class
8036955 you never know which part of the internet youll need the do you need sun cream part the whats the quickest way to the airport part the what about an ocean view room part or the can you really afford this part which is why all parts of the internet are on the iphone
8036956 we noted apples argument that the ad was about site availability rather than technical detail but considered the claims youll never know which part of the internet youll need and all parts of the internet are on the iphone implied users could access all websites and see them in their entirety
8036957 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8036958 we concluded the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8036959 with the use of a blindfold a knife and a deck of cards criss attempts to teach ufc president dana white first hand how to do a prediction of his own can dana pull off a little magic with the help of the mindreak
8036960 attempts to merge through metal and pass from one oil drum to another
8036961 im sure there were a few people who thought we were going to drop more points against portsmouth but from our point of view it was a case of win at all costs
8036962 as a squad we agreed we didnt want to find ourselves in that situation again making a slow start it was vital we won as many of the early games as possible we started off with a stutter against newcastle but we now have that first win which is a relief
8036963 the other teams are going to gain a game on us this weekend and some will be a few points ahead so it was important we kept any points difference to a minimum
8036964 when we did an open workout there about 4 000 people showed up to watch me train at a mall
8036965 you can take it from there i speak the language i get along with everybody well i understand the people in the philippines and their struggles i just keep it real with them and they love the fact that im down no matter how big or small i am in the fight im going to be fighting and they love it i just feed off the energy so its kind of like a cyclical thing with them as much as they give me i give it back to them
8036966 yeah about 4 000 people showed up it was ridiculous
8036967 the ufc was like i cant believe theres this many people here they said they arranged this in 10 days and this is how many people showed up
8036968 man to be able to fight in front of my parents own country and have them watch in araneta coliseum where the thrilla in manila took place that would mean a lot to me
8036969 i dont know that might even mean more than any titles because its home i guess thats a super big deal if the ufc is down to going to the philippines im for sure down
8036970 japan is another country that the ufc has in its expansion plans
8036971 says the woman with a picture of her panties for a profile picture right
8036972 the guy who wrote this isnt too good at characterisation is he
8036973 like a vampire who leaves no reflection in a mirror
8036974 its great im pretending to be this woman except hee hee im not and hes taking it seriously
8036975 if social media is about building bridges its bound to attract some trolls
8036976 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 pounds for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings
8036977 fluffy sissy frilly prissy et cetera just a lie to make things look better
8036978 snow white like those photos of snow when the snows blue and not white
8036979 hes not really called bacon hes yves but we call him bacon because it suits him so much better given how badly hes burned
8036980 sinscrit dans une logique et bertrand delano a les qualit s pour pr tendre cette responsabilit
8036981 mais avant de choisir un premier secr taire il nous faut d finir une orientation une strat gie un programme de travail qui suppose la constitution dun p le central au ps
8036982 avec dautres car le parti socialiste a besoin dune direction forte pour lui donner la dynamique indispensable
8036983 ce p le doit se former partir de quatre l ments
8036984 la recherche dun rassemblement de la gauche autour dun projet commun
8036985 que ceux qui portent les m mes id es et les m mes conceptions se rassemblent
8036986 mais jusque l je ferai en sorte que se cr e un v ritable sursaut au sein du ps car il y a danger si on ne met pas un coup darr t la fragmentation la d valorisation du travail collectif lindividualisme il y a risque de d classement du parti socialiste de perte de sa cr dibilit et de d sesp rance gauche
8036987 le choix du premier secr taire nest pas celui du candidat la pr sidentielle ndlr
8036988 this song is great fun and good for western swing dancing
8036989 but it also contains a bit of a message for folks who may often burn the candle at both ends
8036990 with release 11 of the sdk collection we continue to expand platform support for our highly sought after extraction and matching algorithms
8036991 our goal is and has always been to provide our partners with the tools they need to win business opportunities around the world
8036992 our focus has always been on providing world class fingerprint technology including development tools to allow our partners to build state of the art biometric systems because our reseller partners are central to secugens marketing strategy we are very pleased to extend their reach with the new platform support in the secugen sdk collection release 11
8036993 the loudest voices were not those of kennedy or michelle obama but the really big story themselves
8036994 the dangerous situation for obama is that there are thousands of reporters with nothing better to do than find a puma to talk to
8036995 this was the first chance weve really had to live out our values
8036996 were not just keeping people on the payroll because were nice at the end of all this our hope is that well end up with a more skilled north american workforce
8036997 the state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race sex color ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment public education or public contracting
8036998 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15bn this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
8036999 in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8037000 this approach would be dramatically cheaper than any other means of achieving the same result to be truly effective a global response is needed but the uk has an opportunity to lead the way
8037001 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
8037002 forest and peatland conservation is one of the few methods at our disposal where we can do this now and at low cost
8037003 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
8037004 the hypocrisy of the government is staggering while ministers are calling for the international community to look at the impact of biofuels here in the uk the governments policy means people are filling up their cars with biofuels that may be damaging the environment and endangering food security
8037005 it was like having sex with a stuffed animal with those fake eyes and fake hair a stuffed animal with a real set of you know what it feels like having sex with an oversize cabbage patch you got silicone parts that are made for toys
8037006 if this is true i think its a gr8 deal id also bring in arsharvin because they would complement each other then a leader in a centrehalf and a new graham roberts for the general we r crying out for in midfield i do believe we will sign a few by sept 1st and hope they all have a belief in themselves to finally kickstart our season up the yids

8037014 it shows that some folks in the industry are desperate
8037015 the reality is that the industrys structure has not changed
8037016 mortgage brokers are paid on commission loan officers are rewarded for volume there are the same pressures to get things done
8037017 mortgage fraud will not disappear in fact it is expected to significantly grow evolve and penetrate new areas within the industry
8037018 por sorte nada precisou ser refilmado sim fomos chamados ao set semana passada para adicionar no roteiro os machucados dele n o porque fosse necess rio mas para shia conseguir ficar o resto da filmagem com a prote o na m o
8037019 algumas coisas n o conseguimos fazer no primeiro por causa de or amento e tamb m porque o est dio achou que eram exc ntricas demais algumas delas conseguimos incluir agora no segundo
8037020 calcular o tempo do filme pelo roteiro pode ser uma armadilha porque a a o na realidade mais longa do que no papel
8037021 o primeiro filme tinha tr s tramas o caroto e seu carro os soldados combatendo em linhas inimigas e o pessoal governamental de defesa reagindo aos transformers em uma esp cie de filme cat strofe com v rios pontos de vista o segundo vai ser diferente ser o mais hist rias paralelas do que convergentes e o filme ser mais global com certeza

8037025 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
8037026 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
8037027 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
8037028 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
8037029 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
8037030 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
8037031 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
8037032 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself
8037033 one is free to discriminate when it comes to private property for any reason
8037034 since its discovery in 1896 ss cygni has captivated astronomers it ranks as one of the most popular objects in the american association of variable star observers aavso observing program
8037035 this is the largest targeted workplace enforcement operation we have carried out in the united states to date
8037036 one is free to discriminate when it comes to private property for any reason

8037041 i have never been so optimistic i have never been so engaged i have never been so motivated
8037042 given all of these considerations we believe it imperative as nasa continues the transition from the to the successor vehicles that the means for producing additional flight hardware and obtaining additional flight engineering and support services not be completely and irretrievable lost through destruction or deterioration at least until a clear path to alternative launch capabilities is at hand
8037043 at minimum direct nasa to take no action for at least one year from now that would preclude the extended use of the space shuttle beyond 2010
8037044 one is free to discriminate when it comes to private property for any reason
8037045 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8037046 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8037047 the patience of the afghan people has run out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8037048 i want to remind all parties engaged in the conflict that the protection of civilians must be their primary concern they must respect their duties under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect the people we are here to serve
8037049 we will try to create an infrastructure for an agreement
8037050 i worked hard i did my job but the boys at twitter are just as churlish as the boys at sterling cooper such a pity theyre so petty
8037051 its legal maneuvering may go down as the single worst use misuse of social media
8037052 to find that this amniotic compartment which we have traditionally viewed as somewhat sacrosanct is infected significantly more often than we thought is a little shocking
8037053 if we could prevent these infections in the first place or detect them sooner we might one day be able to prevent some of these premature births
8037054 the psystar saga takes another series of turns not only is the
8037055 we found contrary to current recommendations that actually consumption of these foods did not increase the risk of diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and didnt appear to increase the risk of developing diverticulosis or its complications
8037056 there are probably going to be a subset of people where perhaps a more restrictive diet does benefit them
8037057 if you are a patient with known diverticular disease and you have had the experience of eating seeds nuts and popcorn and developed diverticular pain as assessed by your doctor you should probably not have those foods
8037058 he is just as good as when we saw him in the 70s maybe better
8037059 you can do this with a relational database if you wanted to so why are you bothering with something new
8037060 its all about sorting if you can do it quickly enough
8037061 ive been working with jimmy and john paul and trying to do some new material and some writing
8037062 i dont know what it will be but it will be something
8037063 i really felt it was on the cards from the moment we walked off stage at the o2
8037064 at the moment all i know is i have the great pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and start work on some material
8037065 whatever it ends up as to get a chance to jam with two people like that is a phenomenal thing for me
8037066 all i see are the wrinkles the spots the moles the receding hairline
8037067 the sale should attract enormous interest not only from within britain but also from lady pidgeons customers from around the world
8037068 creating the vision of english grandeur that her clients aspired to
8037069 lady pidgeon had a very strong eye for classic english furniture and french opulence and there will be some exceptional pieces in the sale
8037070 put it out there and whoever can find it can read it
8037071 now its out there and its being given weight and some authority and im not sure its a legitimate authority
8037072 i think some people take it too much like cold hard fact and base their information on that
8037073 were moving into an opinionated way of receiving news and youre going to have to look through those opinions to be able to form your own
8037074 roy clayton is more understanding of samirs position than anybody else in the fbi actually is
8037075 what they have in common is that roys father was a baptist minister and samirs father was a religious man as well
8037076 when guy and i first sat down to look at the script he was enthusiastic about it
8037077 he said look jeffrey i normally have a lot of notes i have to say i dont have many notes on this script but lets literally go through it page by page and look at every line and we did and he would analyze sometimes down to a contraction saying i do not versus i dont that type of thing for guy could be important
8037078 ill generally write out every scene thats in the film on a couple of pieces of paper just with a little one line
8037079 and then i can scan it a bit and go this first third of the film generally im kind of calm then i might do something on one piece of paper that just relates to the energy of the character
8037080 ive got a bit of obsessive compulsive disorder i think so i can get a little obsessed about detail stuff
8037081 i would feel quite anxious around people and be nervous that i was going to get asked some question i couldnt answer and i wasnt going to know what to say
8037082 on stage youve got dialogue youve learned youve got a paying audience it couldnt be better you know my therapist would say its probably because of having lost my dad when i was really young and that being a really tragic thing that i was worried about what was potentially around the corner being really disastrous so in doing a play or doing some structured work as an actor its set thats probably why i was drawn to it in a way
8037083 it was a pivotal film for me and quite a good representation of what im interested in
8037084 it probably enabled a little more confidence i tend to project my father figure onto any director that im working with or mother if im working with a female or it can be confused but chris nolans trusting me was really important and just allowed me to trust myself more
8037085 it was a bit of a breakdown actually and i was smoking a lot of pot leading up to that time as well and that clearly didnt help at all
8037086 id just been taking opportunity after opportunity after opportunity i didnt have my own direction going on so it was really about decompressing and i was seeing a therapist and i just needed to take stock
8037087 there are already several new improved versions of the kindle in the works
8037088 but amazon has no plans however for an mp3 music audio version
8037089 it seems to me to be unconvincing that a huge large amount of money will improve your reputation it just means that your lawyers are better than the other persons lawyers but to have the court stating that certain things are untrue seems to me to be emphatic
8037090 over the years i have been a part of the hurly burly of the british press and there has been plenty that has been said about me that has been rude and unsupportive i have never sought to pursue expressions of opinion however facts are facts and lies are lies and it seems to me that the law exists to allow people to clarify that
8037091 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers through an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
8037092 o god come to our aid o lord make haste to help us
8037093 sure its boyish humor perhaps to wish for something like that but at the same time its something people feel very strongly about theyre concerned about where obama would take the nation
8037094 brooke informed me two days ago that very soon wed be producing our own version of two and a half men
8037095 that would imply its a boy so until we know well refer to it as two and a half people were beyond happy to be new parents together
8037096 we couldnt be more excited to add to our already big and happy family
8037097 yes i am having another child and you can take this phallic award and shove it up your a whore i mean denise
8037098 gaza is on the threshold of becoming the first territory to be intentionally reduced to a state of abject destitution with the knowledge acquiescence and some would say encouragement of the international community
8037099 its like a meeting with a dietitian we need to make the palestinians lose weight but not to starve to death

8037102 it is microsoft policy not to comment on rumors and speculation
8037103 frenchs actions in noticing the potential burial site and immediately stopping work at the location exemplify the kind of stewardship heritage programs encourages and expects from all oregonians
8037104 the recovered remains include that of an adult male two children younger than age 10 and an infant
8037105 the remains recovered in may were apparently missed during the initial disinternment more than 100 years ago
8037106 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8037107 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8037108 when you got hugged by kevin duckworth you got hugged
8037109 he just needed something to do he was so kind to people i think he was a very good person and i think the city is going to miss him
8037110 during the midpoint of the season we played at missouri and kevin matched up against steve stipanovich
8037111 kevin finished that game with a double double and it was at that point that i think he realized he might have a future in basketball

8037118 we are using the same engine as the xbox 360 ps3 and pc while the wii console itself has no hardware shaders we do a diffuse and alpha pass on the textures we retain many of the particle effects and explosion effects from the engine and do this all with a good framerate all of this means that were able to achieve a high level of graphical quality for the wii

8037121 thats the guy i want to talk to the half wit
8037122 when you win you should give your speech in english
8037123 mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of the camera youre excited and youre not thinking in english
8037124 the economy is bad and we are losing sponsors everybody understands
8037125 i want to thank all the volunteers who made this possible
8037126 i had 179 to the front so i went with the hybrid
8037127 defend denver explain that to me what does that mean
8037128 do you have a message do you have an actual message
8037129 jason has done a fantastic job in his role managing our marketing efforts and increasing ticket sales
8037130 the merger of these units under his leadership has been very successful for us and his skills will be vitally important as we move into tcf bank stadium this promotion is well deserved
8037131 en los ltimos a os ucrania se ocup de resaltar organizaciones sin fines de lucro y grupos culturales en su desfile por el d a de la independencia pero este a o han decidido regresar a llevar a cabo un desfile militar
8037132 if you french fry when your supposed to pizza your gonna have a bad time
8037133 if you truly feel the need to medicate yourself please put down the chemicals amp stick to the herb
8037134 what do you mean i left our apartment door open
8037135 im essentially a checkbook and a sperm bank but im okay with that
8037136 remember marriage what was its function again was it that maladaptive organ that intermittently produced gastrointestinal antigens and sometimes got so inflamed that it painfully erupted
8037137 hey guys did you know your wives are dreaming of divorce
8037138 data hg mirror mercurial plugin 0 12 tracext hg backend py
8037139 i got all kids down to the cellar right quick but then i realized that i didnt have my twine ball with me
8037140 it was like there was a supernatural force was carrying him ive never seen a man with such a purpose in all my life
8037141 i would say he was possessed by something stronger than the tornado
8037142 i saw my twine ball start to scoot across the floor and toward the black funnel i knew then what i had to do
8037143 when mayor nickels announced car free days we knew we had to do something
8037144 weather is what we know so naturally it was our preferred weapon
8037145 if the city wants to close a mile and a half stretch of road to cars its only fair that we close it to pedestrians and bicycles too
8037146 have fun and see what the city could be like if we drive less
8037147 people drive their cars through here as if the roads were built for them or something
8037148 im all in favor of driving less but i dont understand why the city broke into my garage and towed my prius
8037149 nobody took advantage of the empty streets to do any of the sixteen entertaining and creative activities we listed on the car free day activities webpage
8037150 how can someone with an annual income in the top 0 1 percent possibly be in touch with the average american
8037151 if youre like me and youve got an income no higher than the top 0 3 or 0 2 percent you might have a different perspective than john mccain
8037152 four million dollars i dont remember how much i made last year but im pretty sure it wasnt four million dollars i think
8037153 its just so hard to choose between the guy with a single two million dollar mansion and the guy with six or seven half million dollar houses
8037154 mccain owns six or seven houses right so that means hes losing even more money than most people with this housing bust
8037155 so in a way i think john mccain actually can relate to me better
8037156 with the south lake union line already running at nearly eight percent capacity we cannot afford to waste time on this new line
8037157 i have already purchased the property at 1165 harrison and will begin demolition of the existing structure as soon as we acquire permits from the city
8037158 its a real shame that we have to displace local businesses like this
8037159 but you cant create a new and vibrant neighborhood here without bulldozing at least a few of these eyesores
8037160 i had no idea that building this new streetcar would mean eliminating those people
8037161 if allen strikes us down we shall become more powerful than he could possibly imagine
8037162 also we plan to relocate to the giant pauls big toe once the statue is completed anyway so leaving this location is really no big deal
8037163 how can it be art if it doesnt look like it was formed from leftover construction materials
8037164 this j p patches statue doesnt seem controversial at all
8037165 if it doesnt offend people with outdated traditional moral values then whats the point
8037166 i just cant believe we are honoring a character that stands for such blatantly anti fremont values like washing your hands face neck and ears or sharing your toys
8037167 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8037168 shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
8037169 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8037170 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8037171 cannot process request at this moment please try again later
8037172 the main thing we did was talk about the true freshman whether it be a walk on or scholarship guy and whether or not hell get in the game
8037173 i know youre going to ask who will but im not going to answer that question right now except to say that a large number of true freshmen should play i would say 8 12 would probably play true freshmen
8037174 there was a spell there where he was getting some reps but thats kind of fallen by the wayside
8037175 thats not to say we couldnt revive the idea one day
8037176 the idea of knowshon in the open field with the kind of blocking weve gotten lately would be an exciting thing to see
8037177 so we might get him some work there before the year is over i know hed be excited about the opportunity we might trot him out there it would be exciting to see what would happen
8037178 bryan and prince have been playing back and forth for the starting role so its not that big a deal it could go either way it doesnt matter whos going to start
8037179 you guys reporters worry too much about the depth chart these guys are all going to play
8037180 from what i understand they might be running a little bit of a two quarterback system until things settle down anyway
8037181 they are a team that has had tremendous success over the years appalachian state only lost one game last year and that was to georgia southern so that gets my attention we have a high level of respect for georgia southern most of their kids are from in state just as ours are we think it will be a pretty heated rivalry i know we have some players who played high school ball with these guys so there is a lot of pride in this game we are looking forward to getting it started
8037182 when we got into camp i thought we started out with the normal energy excitement and enthusiasm then we just hit an injury bug a little bit more than we are used to having a couple of kids are already lost for the season since camp started in trinton sturdivant and charles white others are going to lose some significant playing time in quintin banks and brannan southerland the camp was a little different than others in that it was frustrating for us to not have the players there to practice we couldnt evaluate the young guys as much as we would like to weve been juggling more in this camp than we did all last year put together on the offensive line one thing that has concerned me about this camp is the lack of warm weather its been cool like today there isnt much heat and much humidity even this saturday if it gets sunny and 92 degrees like they say it might it could be tough on our guys i hope we have enough depth to withstand it
8037183 knowshon had a spell where he couldnt get any reps and i guess he fell by the wayside
8037184 knowshon will of course get the majority of carries richard samuel and caleb king will both get reps i hope dontavius jackson and carlton thomas both get reps too im not discounting them from getting a carry here and there all those tailbacks are still in the running to play as true freshmen richard and caleb are the frontrunner for the next reps i cant say who will be the first one to get the carry they will be the two who get the majority of reps after knowshon
8037185 our defense has a chance to be pretty good we have a lot of returning players and starters they are guys who know what they are doing and guys who know what it takes to play the georgia way im confident that they will get after it pretty good i wouldnt necessarily say this is the fastest defense weve had im not saying its not its hard to gauge i think we looked faster than usual last year because i know we played more guys than usual the more guys you play the fresher they are and the faster they look
8037186 is it a good thing its good if we stay there and if we are there at the end its been good as far as a lot of positive publicity for our football team has it helped me motivate i would have to think its a motivating factor for our guys it is an exciting factor for our guys to feel like people believe that about our program they know it will be up for judgment every week so i guess it was fun while it lasted
8037187 we were very concerned to start three freshmen last year that is a concern to have three freshman linemen start in the sec we did have some stability we had an anchor in fernando velasco chester adams did a good job too fernando was the leader of that group now the leadership we had last year is gone we were thinking there would be three returning starters but with an injury and a suspension we have one returning starter chris davis played guard and now hes our center everyone else is a first time starter
8037188 his leadership has absolutely evolved he did what good leaders do when he was young he watched the older guys and tried to learn from the fernando velascos thomas browns and the kregg lumpkins his first season he tried to learn what he could do and help the team in his second year he tried to perfect his trade now hes in that role of leader hes comfortable and hes always that way because he is comfortable he has definitely been more vocal
8037189 i think he is just like anybody hes going to get more and more comfortable with repetition obviously the season hasnt started but from what we are putting in and the things i see him doing i like it were pretty good at talking about what we think will work against a team and putting something together its been good
8037190 i just want to see us come out there and play with excitement if we go out there and execute and play with a bunch of energy thats all you can really ask for weve been working really hard and beating up on each other i think we are ready to get out there and play another team
8037191 i really dont want to speak on whether its better or worse but i know that as far as experience wise im a year more experienced chris davis is a year more experienced clint boling is a year more experienced kiante tripp and josh davis got a few reps last year too we have two good years underneath our belts working with coach stacy searels and all of his techniques i think we did okay in the scrimmages that weve had and i think well do fine in my opinion as long as we stay health and do what coach searels says well do fine
8037192 his talent is unmatched when you get a chance to spend time with him his personality the energy that he brings to the game and the way he gets the fans involved people actually feel apart of knowshon moreno his teammates rally behind him hes just a guy that you just cant help but love and pull for
8037193 its kind of something that just happens through time you appreciate being a bulldog a little more the older you get and you kind of take things a little more serious out there you are kind of more focused and the young guys feed off of that because they know youve been through the tough times youve been through the ups and downs and youve been through a lot of the battles that they are going to see
8037194 ive been a part of a 9 4 team and an 11 2 team and i feel like we ended on a high note both years obviously playing hawaii and being able to beat them that would give us in the medias eyes a high ranking but i think our team considers itself a top team going into the season the hype has been increased tenfold i think thats something that comes with the territory but we arent thinking about it i know georgia southern doesnt care what we are ranked and i just know that this game is going to be really fun
8037195 its a lot different from practice in camp you are going against guys you know you think its kind of a competition and youve been going against them all camp now youre going against another group of receivers every single week and its something new to look forward to with every game you get more experience and you grow as a player so hopefully for the younger people that can help
8037196 all we can do is run hard and play fast we dont have that much stuff to see on them but all we can do is play hard and play fast and hopefully we can come out victorious
8037197 i try not to look at all the hype and all the different polls they have at the end of the day you still have to play ball and play games im proud im always proud of history and this is the first time in georgia history that weve been ranked no 1 but i really try not to read into the polls
8037198 it makes it a lot more difficult last year they had a great quarterback which had more of a running style i think we are prepared and we have a feel for what kinds of things they are going to do out there so we have to adjust at game time i think we will be ready

8037206 this is a preemptive strike against all the hateful bigots out there that simply do not understand the normal and natural flow of politics
8037207 it is utterly preposterous to suggest that the governor would somehow be influenced by these gifts
8037208 it really is amazing the crazy accusations that people will throw around in an election year
8037209 are quite clearly jealous of the tribes and of women
8037210 i rejected the gambling compact because i realized that realistically what would the state do with 140 million a year
8037211 i mean really washington states economy is literally the envy of the entire planet we dont need the tribes money
8037212 its a sad day in america when a sitting politician cant receive a few million dollars worth of personal gifts from a group that stands to make obscene amounts of money as a result of her decisions without being accused of impropriety

8037216 the business climate in washington is pretty challenging right now thanks to the seemingly endless amount of red tape the state forces you to go through to perform even the simplest of tasks
8037217 but we are confident that with just a little more effort seemingly endless can turn into literally endless
8037218 i told them that i was committed to new york city opera and signed my contract
8037219 nobody knows at the moment what will happen anyway with their six week season plus rehearsals period the bayreuth festival should not affect my work for nyco on the contrary it could reinforce the international stature of city opera

8037228 whose idea was it that the best way to transport a 6 foot 160 pound human was to put him into a 2 500 pound steel cage thats ridiculously inefficient and wasteful
8037229 but dont you think its silly to carry around that much empty space and emit all that exhaust just to sit motionless in traffic half the time anyway
8037230 dont i think what did i just say about thinking just do whats fun and easy convenience is king baby
8037231 but right now to get to work we sit around in our car for over an hour a day just to drive 40 miles round trip at a cost of over 150 per month and anyway arent you tired of being a slave to traffic
8037232 i have been a good employee i never had any problem with anybody the only sole decision was made because of the security clearance

8037243 for the college to become a university the most important thing to do is to arrange for an autonomous framework to conduct its own affairs as in other countries so that the university becomes accountable to the public

8037290 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8037291 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8037292 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder

8037307 we dont think the credit cycle has bottomed out yet
8037308 the tax will fall most heavily on the weakest so the conclusion is the weak are going to get weaker and the strong will be able to take advantage of the weak
8037309 the numbers are alarming but we are coming off of an incredibly low base of problem institutions and failures
8037310 this is nowhere near what we had seen during prior periods of weakness are we done i dont think anyone would predict that we have a ways to go

8037317 as you all know ive fought many elections and leadership races over the past couple of years and im quite happy to govern
8037318 obviously governments always prefer a majority but i think we can make a minority work most of the time so im happy to keep on governing as long as were getting some things done
8037319 i am unable to lead the easiest minority government in canadian history where my legislation is unopposed and will break my own fixed election date law because others might break it first by calling election which will deliver another minority government and leave canadians in exactly the same situation as before vote for me for more of the same
8037320 why does harper need an election to get a mandate
8037321 seeing as how the broad expectation was that fixed terms would only become relevant once we elected our next majority government

8037337 there is however a need to remove the confusion and segregate the functions of the commission and that of the secretariat
8037338 the separation of the role of the commission from the public service ministry is absolutely necessary so as to preserve and protect its independence and to assign the functional role to the permanent secretary for the public service
8037339 the public service commission will comprise its appointed members and will be serviced by a secretariat whose duty will be to receive submissions from the secretary of the public service on its constitutional functions and implement the decisions
8037340 the designation of the head of the public service will be the permanent secretary for the public service
8037341 the permanent secretary for the public service will report directly to the prime minister and operate from that office
8037342 all statutory functions of the commission including office accommodation employment policies in the public service remunerations job evaluation transfers training etc will be undertaken by the permanent secretary for the public service

8037368 as far as im concerned that needs to be looked into
8037369 its something i havent been able to do in the past year to go out and practice with no limitations i worked this morning and i wasnt as sore as i thought i would be its all positive that i can go out there back to back days im going to get some treatment and see how i feel tomorrow but as of right now i feel pretty good
8037370 and he has taken a lot of the team and seven on seven snaps which is a real improvement along those lines
8037371 we havent had much work together in the past few months so its good to have everybody in their positions and getting good work
8037372 hes looked good the past couple of days so we just have to continue to grow he knows what hes doing out there he knows the offense has to get our timing back and well be good to go
8037373 its something im still getting used to but they do help a lot
8037374 last year was frustrating i did some pretty good things but i didnt play as well as i wanted to all the time i figured that with me being able to go out and practice on a consistent basis i wont have those peaks and valleys and lows and things like that and i can stay on an even plane and to try and be great every sunday
8037375 im going to continue my treatment and like i said im feeling pretty good i figured that with me being able to go and practice that itll get stronger and itll get used to me running cutting and jumping and things like that and work my ankle back into shape its positive nobody is more excited than myself and i just want to get back to my old self
8037376 the surgery went well the knee looked good the prognosis is very very optimistic for a full recovery
8037377 general manager jerry reese and michael did talk but as of immediately after practice there has been no information
8037378 i have nothing to tell you on that because i wasnt a part of the conversation but i know that they had spoken
8037379 if michaels heart is in the right spot and he truly wants and has the desire to play then without a doubt open arms
8037380 i dont even know what you are talking about that is how disrupting it is
8037381 it is all hype right now i havent talked to michael i dont know anybody who has talked to michael michael is not here right now so we are just worried about the guys who are here
8037382 if mike comes back of course we are going to welcome him back with open arms and be more than happy that he is coming back and if not we have to move forward
8037383 i just hope that whatever is best for him and is best for our team
8037384 hes been a good teammate for a long time now and whatever happens happens im just happy to still be here and i think our team has a great opportunity this year
8037385 right now we will play them a minimum amount of time
8037386 perhaps 10 snaps and we will pick and choose a little bit on that as well
8037387 a really really really fine young guy just a very enjoyable young man to be around and very sincere he had a difficult time with it we had a difficult time telling him just a really really good kid and we all wish him the best he has been around here a while he has become one of our own he has had some unfortunates with the achilles a year ago i tell everybody the same thing here is a kid that tears the achilles and makes the catch that doesnt happen very often usually whenever an injury of that nature happens the player no longer can focus on what he was doing it is just the injury this kid catches the ball he is quite a guy and i wish him we all wish him the very best
8037388 medically we felt that he will be much stronger and better with some more time
8037389 ive been with this coaching staff for five years and management and knowing guys since i came here so nothing has really been a surprise
8037390 thats a roster spot and guys have to go out there and go to war i wouldnt be able to do that so i think when you look at it from that standpoint we have a bunch of guys at the wide receiver spot and i think we have some good guys on special teams and ill lend my knowledge for the time im just anxious about getting out on the field

8037393 wake up america in 2001 the oil companies the war contractors and the neo con artists seized the economy and have added 4 trillion dollars of unproductive spending to the national debt
8037394 borrowed money to bomb bridges in iraq afghanistan and pakistan no money to rebuild bridges in america money to start a hot war with iran now we have another cold war with russia while the american economy has become a game of russian roulette
8037395 if there was an olympics for misleading mismanaging and misappropriating this administration would take the gold
8037396 we cant afford another republican administration wake up america the insurance companies took over health care wake up america

8037404 he was my mentor i still feel like im walking with him sometimes i feel connected at the hip to minnesota

8037409 this update reflects mdots ongoing commitment to providing michigan residents with quarterly reports about state owned bridges citizens can be assured that michigans bridges are carefully inspected and well maintained
8037410 one year after minnesotas bridge collapse michigan policymakers continue to ignore over 500 state bridges rated in poor condition 163 of which are serious
8037411 the sheer number of bad bridges is frightening given our dire situation with plummeting transportation dollars

8037428 its amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
8037429 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics because at the end of the day let me tell you what i m good at im good at writing songs and singing what im not educated in is the field of political science and so for me to be sharing my views and influencing people of who i think they should be voting for i think would be very irresponsible on my part so ill just keep my mouth shut on that i think celebrity endorsements hurt politicians because as soon as somebody comes out for a politician especially in hollywood when they all go im voting for this guy i go thats not who im voting for as soon as oprah winfrey pops up and goes ha la la la la im like i love barrack obama i hate oprah winfrey i dont hate her i just dont believe in her so i dont want any part of any of that i think celebrities hurt politicians

8037458 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
8037459 the greens believe that children are the same as adults as soon as they are born
8037460 deserve at least as much protection from violence under the law as
8037461 should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in new zealand
8037462 would you happily stand by and watch someone else friend teacher aunt etc smack your child or is this a holier than thou only i may use violence against my child situation
8037463 do you think you physically own your child or do you believe they are little individuals and its your job to raise and care for them until they can care for themselves
8037464 ive always wondered why do smackers favour hitting children on the bottom really is it because it hurts more there
8037465 to those who advocate smacking would you happily stand by and watch someone else friend teacher aunt etc smack your child or is this a holier than thou only i may use violence against my child situation
8037466 children need to learn that if you take on a bigger person than yourself you will probably loose they need to learn that cars and big mack trucks dont care about childrens rights they need to learn that their actions are directly linked to all those around them obviously if a two year old decides he is going to fearlessly take on the whole world some one has to moderate his ambition a strong willed two year old in full flight is a sight you never forget a strategic smack on the bum can literally save his life
8037467 as i have pointed out elsewhere it is now technically illegal to even physically restrain a child and force them to sit on a naughty mat please explain how you can discipline a violent child without breaking the law

8037489 c s lewis once quipped that the more medieval he became in his outlook the farther from roman catholicism he seemed to grow the history of the doctrine of sola scriptura tends to produce the same effect in many of us once one gets beyond the superficial individualistic confused accounts of this doctrine presented in contemporary evangelicalism this teaching becomes very natural organic medieval and apostolic in contrast roman catholic and eastern orthodox accounts fall out of rather perfectionistic and rationalistic commitments that are alien to the earthiness of biblical reality submitting to an infallible magisterium requires relatively little faith everything is in principle neat and clean like a doctors office or a robot husband a perfect husband would make for a very easy marriage faith wouldnt be hard at all submission takes on much more fascinating dimensions when marriage involves sinners in this light the various widely publicized departures of many evangelicals to roman catholicism and eastern orthodoxy have the distinct aroma of youthful haste and short term zeal the sanhedrin was far better organized than the fishermen and it had a grand liturgy an authoritative line of oral tradition and a succession of leaders in a healthy church those forms are good and holy but to have turned to the sanhedrin at that time would have been to embrace apostasy truth beauty and goodness were with the fishermen

8037492 i think hes the person like he would be always next to you like whenever you need help he would be there

8037495 we were making jokes at olympics i should try compete something else because i was just doing running and sprints
8037496 the evidence is not sufficient to form an opinion on the cause or causes of the mishap
8037497 no debris has been recovered or is likely to be recovered that will adequately explain this crash

8037500 we do not want international forces to leave afghanistan until the time our security institutions are able to defend afghanistan independently
8037501 within the framework of afghan law with respect to international law
8037502 mission is based on a u n mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
8037503 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8037504 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
8037505 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8037506 we can confirm that us ship borne humanitarian aid will be delivered to poti tomorrow
8037507 ego autem fidenter dico quia quisquis se universalem sacerdotem vocat vel vocari desiderat in elatione sue antichristum praecurrit quia superbiendo se caeteris praeponit nec dispari superbia ad errorem ducitur quia sicut perversus ille deus videri vult super omnes homines ita quisquis iste est qui solus sacerdos appelari appetit super reliquos sacerdotes se extollit
8037508 therefore i fully affirm that whoever calls himself the universal priest or wants to be called that elevates himself to antichrist because he vaunts himself over all the others not only does this extreme arrogance lead to error its also perverse since this person wants to be seen as god over all people thus whoever he is who wants to be called the priest alone he exalts himself over all the other priests

8037512 wake up america this is not a call for you to take a new direction from right to left this is call for you to go from down to up up with the rights of workers up with wages up with fair trade up with creating millions of good paying jobs rebuilding our bridges ports and water systems up with creating millions of sustainable energy jobs to lower the cost of energy lower carbon emissions and protect the environment up with health care for all up with education for all up with home ownership up with guaranteed retirement benefits up with peace up with prosperity up with the democratic party up with obama biden
8037513 the energy the excitement and that passion and we have to wake up
8037514 he hit many of the issues right on the head
8037515 i think he inspired this whole convention hall on his points
8037516 he always stands up for what he believes in i knew that he probably did not have a chance to make it to the presidency himself but i think he gave us so much just being in the run just being in the primary just pulling up those issues for him to come on and speak for a state that is so important in this election i think it was wonderful
8037517 i am not running for senate i am not running for senate

8037520 head down this street a while youll see a conoco station turn right or maybe left anyhow its that way
8037521 at this age when the parents dont get to come into the classroom very often its just keeping them up to date with whats going on
8037522 i think its absolutely vital and its the real world if you dont offer children these opportunities these days youre giving them a lesser opportunity to learn
8037523 multimedia is engaging and motivating you can show them something in a context and they respond to it
8037524 teachers have to learn as well and they have to adapt
8037525 the easy thing for us is quick communication and parents can do the same back to us
8037526 this is one of the reasons why it is so important for us to be at events like the dnc
8037527 without the truth trucks i doubt if we would ever get the opportunity to show mrs obama the reality of what her husbands extremist support for abortion really means in human terms a pictures worth a thousand words and she definitely got the message today
8037528 it becomes a little more real when someone like mrs obama sees her family name on top of photos of the bloody bodies of actual aborted babies it is important for the obamas to understand the very tragic consequences of their support for abortion we pray that this encounter affects her on a very deep level and gives her more compassion for the innocent lives that are brutally and inhumanely killed by abortion

8037530 if you were starting life today knowing everything you know about the world is this the name you would want to represent you
8037531 sometimes i wonder whether the world is being run by smart people who are putting us on or by imbeciles who really mean it
8037532 the punishment of wise men who refuse to take part in the affairs of government is to live under the government of unwise men
8037533 we are the greatest country in the history of the world there is nothing thats going to occur to our economy except a continuance of the great economic success our great nation has always enjoyed the sun is not setting on our great nation it is rising it is morning in america
8037534 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede
8037535 this is a remarkable accomplishment the first time it happens in the countrys modern history
8037536 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it

8037549 this is a great example of how numerous partners community non profit and corporate have come together to help build a stronger community
8037550 frontier college is thrilled with the results of our summer literacy camp in partnership with fort chipewyan the imperial oil foundation and other community partners
8037551 its wonderful to see camp counsellors connect with kids to develop a love of reading the other benefit is that it will help kids keep their reading skills sharp before they return to school
8037552 some females rejected the advances of males that were in their enclosures only to become willing participants in homosexual encounters immediately after
8037553 on several occasions more than one pair of females shared the same pole and multiple females mounted each other simultaneously at least one multiple encounter involved five female koalas
8037554 our aim was to determine the extent of differences in the homosexual and heterosexual behaviour of female koalas and thereby to determine the purpose of female homosexual behaviour in the koala
8037555 wild koalas brought into captivity clearly display homosexual behaviour on a regular basis a total of 15 heterosexual and 43 homosexual interactions were recorded in separate animals homosexual behaviour was restricted to females only heterosexual encounters were typically twice as long as homosexual encounters

8037566 it would have provided for the elections commission to say sorry we cannot have elections by october 10
8037567 the fact is that the constitution has given a specific date the institution has no choice but to work towards that target we cannot pre emptively say we need to delay the elections
8037568 next week we can pass two bills or even more the most important things are the elections commission judicial services commission and supreme court
8037569 yeah the democratic convention is in denver and security is tight out there it is very tight its tighter than nancy pelosis face
8037570 but heres what they got lined up for the democratic convention there in denver nancy pelosi will give a speech tonight then theres a film about joe biden then theres a introduction to denver by mayor hickenlooper and im telling you break out the dip cmon speakers include senator claire mccaskill senator amy klobuchar and former representative lee hamilton cut me a slice of that
8037571 i believe that each of us no matter what our age or background or walk of life each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation its a belief barack shares a belief at the heart of his lifes work
8037572 its what he did in the illinois senate moving people from welfare to jobs passing tax cuts for hard working families and making sure women get equal pay for equal work
8037573 i am not a defender of the status quo with respect to welfare
8037574 having said that i probably would not have supported the federal legislation because i think it had some problems but im a strong believer in making lemonade out of lemons i think this is a good start and i urge support of this bill
8037575 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
8037576 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
8037577 eight weeks ago sen barack obama was on top in all three of these key swing states and that would make his election almost a sure thing times have changed and the election is now very much a tossup in these states sen obama needs this convention to give his campaign a jump start
8037578 by smaller margins obama still is viewed as best able to fix the economy which voters overwhelmingly see as the most important issue in the election
8037579 the electorate is split by gender and age the gender gap is not new democrats have been winning among women and losing men for decades but its larger than in some recent elections and that is because of the white vote since obama is going to get virtually all the african american vote male or female but the large age gap is new this could be the first generational election in recent history
8037580 sen mccains lead in florida is largely built upon his margin over sen obama among independent voters the group that probably will decide the states 27 electoral votes
8037581 one edge for mccain is his lead over obama when it comes to who voters view the candidates favorably and unfavorably
8037582 the big question in ohio is how much the gender gap will decide the election gender support for each candidate is a virtual mirror of the other mccain is winning men by the same margin that obama is carrying women something has to give one way or the other
8037583 the obama campaign hopes that sen bidens scranton roots will give the democrats a boost in pennsylvania this poll was mostly done before bidens selection was announced so it is too early for any indication whether that will turn out to be the case obamas still in good shape in pennsylvania but his lead has been cut by almost half in the last two months

8037609 dass die betriebe mit dem stern 96 von 100 punkten erreicht haben ist f r mich unbefriedigend der anspruch eines premiumherstellers muss bei mindestens 100 prozent liegen erreicht man diese punktzahl nicht so hei t das in letzter konsequenz die ausf hrung der reparatur und wartungsarbeiten hat den kunden nicht vollst ndig zufrieden gestellt es w re einen versuch wert wenn der adac oder andere tester einmal mehr als 100 punkte vergeben w rden dann k nnte der hersteller pr miert werden der die erwartungen des kunden noch bertrifft denn darin zeigt sich kompromisslose kundenorientierung und absolute dienstleistungsbereitschaft

8037613 it would take an act of idiocy or 10 a barrel oil
8037614 its one thing to have 20 or 30 researchers working on a problem its another thing to have 100 or 120 researchers trying to find a solution eventually someones going to do something different or wrong and bingo a better battery or process is discovered
8037615 we have to learn more about the volts performance characteristics and overall durability including drive train and the type of energy market the volt enters

8037629 making the destruction of bushs presidency a priority over national security makes joe biden
8037630 bidens unyielding pursuit of engagement with iran for more than a decade has made it easier for tehran to pursue its nuclear program
8037631 on taxes biden has followed a path more overtly populist than the one obama has walked pushing for a more progressive tax code that shifts the tax burden away from lower and middle income families and onto high earners and businesses
8037632 in recent years biden has voted against corporate tax cuts the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of 2006 and a motion to consider a permanent repeal of the estate tax
8037633 while i was opposing the credit card industrys bankruptcy bill that made it harder for working families to climb out of debt mccain was supporting it

8037665 when you can credibly run for the presidency only two years out of the illinois state legislature then something in the society is drawing you forward
8037666 the declaration click for text fails to address racial and ethnic crimes committed by sudan tramples international human rights guarantees on free speech places islam above all other religions and targets israel alone implying that it is uniquely racist
8037667 regrettably durban ii is looking more and more like the original durban debacle of 2001
8037668 failed to review any african countrys actions and its inflammatory provisions now threaten to derail the world conference in april
8037669 not be party to an anti semitic and anti western hatefest dressed up as an anti racism conference
8037670 by failing to review the performance of african countries on racism and related intolerance the conference is ignoring its primary mission and squandering a golden opportunity to help africas many victims of racism and xenophobia
8037671 apart from un watchs plenary speech on sunday neither the conference nor its final declaration addressed the sudanese governments crimes against humanity in darfur including the ethnic killings of at least 200 000 black africans mass rape and the displacement of over 1 million men women and children
8037672 moreover the text fails to review the xenophobic attacks that recently broke out in south africa the leading organizer of the abuja meeting and the overall durban process where foreigners notably from zimbabwe and mozambique were targeted in may during a wave of anti immigrant attacks in which at least 62 were killed and tens of thousands were displaced
8037673 nor does the text review the ethnic crimes in kenya this year that killed 1 000 people displaced another 600 000 and burnt down 40 000 buildings in an outburst of tribal bloodletting millions of african victims of xenophobia present and future are ill served by the conferences grant of impunity for racial or ethnic crimes committed in african countries
8037674 inflexibly clinging to free speech in defiance of the sensitivities existing in a society and with absolute disregard for religious feelings
8037675 mirror efforts by islamic states at the un human rights council to insinuate islamic anti blasphemy prohibitions into international law yet un expert on religious freedom asma jahangir and other international human rights experts have expressly opposed defamation of religion resolutions which seek to alter international human rights law by defining religions instead of individuals as the bearers of rights
8037676 the language goes far beyond the recognized norms for balancing prohibitions of racial hatred with respect for free speech which is the lifeblood of democracy if the right to express ones beliefs to question the dogmas of the day in society law politics art science and yes religion is to be restricted by the feelings and sensitivities of others this will mark the end of free speech as we know it
8037677 seeks to impose a hierarchy of religions placing adherents of islam above all others
8037678 this is contrary to the basic principles of equality enshrined in the un charter and the universal declaration of human rights and undermines the very premise of the global struggle against racism
8037679 reiterat ing its concern about the plight of the palestinian people under foreign occupations
8037680 why is a non african situation mentioned in a declaration about africa one that references neither sudans racist killings nor any other country in africa
8037681 the special reference to the palestinian issue implies that israel is practicing racism
8037682 portraying israels conflict as racial is more than political mischief its an attempt to dehumanize israelis and their supporters as uniquely evil we regret that african states today allowed the extreme political agenda of certain middle eastern governments to undermine their legitimate cause
8037683 it is only one paragraph that mentions the palestinians so the interest of israel was never badly damaged

8037721 we believe the distribution market will consolidate and there will be a few big players
8037722 we think were in a very good position to expand into this business
8037723 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os
8037724 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware
8037725 this is a very nice machine even if it probably resembles a dell or some other fairly standard pc

8037729 he and his campaign staff feel quite correctly that his biggest single vulnerability is his perceived lack of experience especially in foreign affairs they felt like they needed someone who could help to allay those concerns
8037730 hillary clinton is my franchise quarterback she knows how to run the offense and she has the guts to stay in the pocket long enough to get off the play no matter the hit she will take

8037732 my bible has 2000 verses about poverty and that is at the heart of gods heart and that is at the heart of the common good
8037733 what we have seen over the last thirty years is not just a couple people standing up to yell the entire political system has been gridlocked and frozen and unable to deal with this issue
8037734 republicans make this an issue where they win seats instead of reduce abortions obama is talking about how do we break the gridlock and reduce the number of abortions what conditions in society can be impacted to prevent number of abortions
8037735 how do we get beyond the definition republicans have that life begins at conception and ends at birth
8037736 as election day approaches we as christians know we need to be committed to praying for the outcome and for those who will be elected to lead us
8037737 but milestone moments like this in our history should remind us of the importance of asking god for spiritual awakening in our land
8037738 as christians we need god to give us wisdom as we select the next president of the united states
8037739 people must realize that government at every level is a lagging social indicator
8037740 true and lasting change in our nation will come from spiritual renewal in the hearts of americas citizens not from government programs

8037742 they do not provide consumers with accurate details of ryanairs pricing nor do they keep consumers informed of changes in our terms conditions or flight information
8037743 illegal and unauthorised activities of these screenscraper ticket tout websites have caused dramatic slowdowns and outages on the ryanair com website
8037744 acquisition would have combined the two leading airlines operating from ireland which currently compete vigorously against each other
8037745 having said that ryanair should have made it impossible for these internet travel agents to buy its tickets in the first place we urge ryanair not to cancel existing tickets with no option of a refund
8037746 and everyone is saying that the irish economy has run its course
8037747 it is true that it is a softer marketplace but it is performing well for us
8037748 they are in a tough market which by their own admission is going to get tougher
8037749 but they ought to outperform itv and meanwhile they have been diversifying into radio and the talksport and irish radio businesses have worked well for them
8037750 well you can always address the issue to the board and i am sure they will do what they can
8037751 quite honestly we couldnt cope with the front lads once the second goal went in it was disappointing to say the least
8037752 if you defend like that youre going to get beat against any level of opposition and i thought the two centre forwards bullied our defenders from start to finish
8037753 im not used to coming to leeds and losing i usually enjoy coming here and putting one over on them but they thoroughly deserved it

8037759 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8037760 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8037761 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8037762 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8037763 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8037764 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8037765 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8037766 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8037767 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8037771 one intriguing result from sundays washington post abc poll which showed barack obama maintaining a narrow 4 percent lead among likely voters was the democratic candidates vault over john mccain on the question of leadership
8037772 obama moves past mccain on leadership a polling glitch or genuine trend
8037773 in march those surveyed chose mccain as the stronger leader by a 53 40 margin in june mccain had a 47 44 lead but in the august poll obama beats mccain by five points 49 44 that is an 18 point switch in four months

8037781 there should be no question in the mind of that voter that their vote is not going to be counted
8037782 all this does is it diminishes what we have been working on for years it just put another question in voters minds of who is counting ballots
8037783 tom udall needs to stand up and say i dont want any question in voters minds about how this election was administered
8037784 this was a decision made by the secretary of states office we dont have anything to do with their personnel matters and i would direct any personnel questions to their office it was a decision made independently by them
8037785 did the appointment of noel originate with the sos or did big bill who cooper has also served as a campaign manager have a hand in the appointment
8037786 just by the mere fact that you are asking the question means that you are not the only one asking the question

8037793 people who want to be in the city then we want to give them the opportunity to vote people who dont want to be in the city why would we force them to vote
8037794 youre not annexing just the taxes of those people that want to come in your annexing the taxes of thousands of people without a voice in the direction of that government

8037802 im not arguing that i have a legal leg to stand on thats not what im saying at all what im saying is that until a court decided that should happen there really should be no vacancy here but im not gonna stand by and let it appear that im being forced out of office thats not good for district 1 thats not good for the county
8037803 i have never at any time made any effort to remove ms
8037804 they have gone back and searched for any reason whatsoever to deny the claim
8037805 to preclude placing a financial burden on his family who had already suffered through one tragedy andrew purchased a life insurance policy from aig andrew chose to list his parents as sole beneficiaries as he was unmarried and did not have children
8037806 aig said that had they known that andrew white had a car accident when he was 16 years old they never would have written the policy to begin with
8037807 they have gone back and searched for any reason whatsoever to deny the claim rather than look for a valid reason

8037809 patients critics and most media all cite the outstanding job the va is doing outsourcing is not the answer
8037810 i just cannot believe that wed ever allow this to happen
8037811 i think that small business owners have to be fearless i think that if you look at the innovators the visionaries these are all people who when people viewed what they were trying to do they wanted them locked up you know its a good idea when people say youre crazy

8037813 its probably no coincidence that many languages around the world have repetitious syllables in their child words baby and daddy in english papa in italian and tata grandpa in hungarian for example
8037814 the language centre of most right handed adults is located on the left side of the brain
8037815 this is consistent with our finding with new born babies and supports our belief humans are born with abilities that allow us to perceive and learn our mother tongue systematically and efficiently
8037816 the brain areas that are responsible for language in an adult do not learn how to process language during development but rather they are specialized at least in part to process language from the start
8037817 many meanings positive and negative are attached to the term masculinity
8037818 to ask a large sample of men what comprises their own sense of masculinity is very useful for both the media and for research these results suggest we should pay attention and ask rather than presume we know
8037819 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status

8037828 it will renew our emphasis to va staff about sensitivity in communicating
8037829 i can only apologize for the familys perception in this tragic case and to let them know that it will serve as a system wide reminder about the importance of clear and compassionate communication

8037835 youre not asthmatic anymore theres nothing wrong with your lungs ill give you a sample sized albuterol inhaler for the next two weeks just in case but i dont think youll need it if youre using it more than 2 3 times a day in two weeks call me and well rethink this but its really just a precaution at this point
8037836 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8037837 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8037838 suppose you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all which candidate are you going to vote for

8037842 problem list of banks increased 30 percent in the second quarter to the highest total in five years as more commercial real estate loans were overdue
8037843 species invasions and extinction the future of native biodiversity on islands
8037844 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8037845 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8037846 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8037847 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8037848 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8037849 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8037850 that by going in and mucking up the system we may have already created the setting where too many species have been packed in and we just havent waited long enough to see these extinctions start to happen
8037851 the whole point of this study was to start looking down the path to see which of these wildly different scenarios might be right
8037852 we havent nailed the answer yet but weve set the stage for answering whether islands are now saturated or not
8037853 it was very surprising to find such a strong correlation between the number of native and exotic plant species on islands around the world
8037854 in ecological research a strong correlation often explains 50 percent of the variation here the correlation between native and exotics explains almost 100 percent of the variation in other words if you know how many native plants are on an oceanic island then you can predict almost perfectly how many exotic plants are there
8037855 i am so happy with my team at the moment
8037856 its always the same if you go everywhere to england america scotland it is the same the most important thing is to have a good relationship with the owner
8037857 at the moment i am very very satisfied i am unhappy about a lot of things but not dissatisfied
8037858 i dont like to talk about only sunshine here this is not true i am very straight i like to have honest people who tell me if they have a problem

8037874 that they were aware of all the endpoints connecting to their organizations networks perhaps not surprisingly half of the respondents were also concerned that a security breach on their organizations networks could jeopardize their employment or that of one of their staff
8037875 194 respondents representing a variety of it functions and companies that ranged in size from small businesses with less than 100 endpoints to large enterprises with more than 10 000 endpoints
8037876 in todays era of mobility there is simply no clear perimeter to stop the bad guys from coming in
8037877 organizations across all industries are recognizing the greatest threat to the network is the endpoint that connects to the interior once inside endpoints of all types become conduits for web based threats and other malware to propagate within the network
8037878 the survey also queried respondents on how important it is to control network access 86 percent said it was important or very important if they planned to deploy microsoft network access protection 67 percent have no plans to deploy it

8037886 working that angle very hard and thats going to be a very high priority focus
8037887 the question that remains is was it planned or was it something that happened by coincidence or was it a bit of both
8037888 what makes this different is that the targets are no longer strictly military communications infrastructure and were now talking about destroying civilian internet sites
8037889 certainly cases involving soldiers in the midst of a violent war are ones that belong within the military system
8037890 this court finds that defendants discharge was reasonably related to the governments interest in ensuring that its soldiers are fit to serve
8037891 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8037892 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8037893 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again

8037911 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
8037912 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

8037928 much of the press is rolling over and playing dead
8037929 the american media is in need of a spine transplant
8037930 weve had so many people coming through and expressing thoughtful responses from a variety of different viewpoints and thats exactly what we were hoping to get
8037931 they gave us a space it was under a bridge and next to a highway with no parking
8037932 so we decided it wasnt worth spending the energy and money to go up there

8037937 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
8037938 it is important for the program that we play hard and play smart
8037939 you only get so many opportunities to do this thats one good thing about being able to play on a thursday night especially this thursday night because its the first one
8037940 its exciting to have outstanding coaches in place and our fall games lined up
8037941 wake techs sports program is now a reality and we can begin in earnest to prepare for the excitement and challenges ahead
8037942 i knew that the guys we had coming in at notre dame especially with the team it would be with the guys that were coming back it was going to be special
8037943 i knew how young the line was and how good the line would be in a couple of years i just kind of weighed all of those me down the road in the future as a football player and as a student and also how it would be coming in with all these great players and to compete at running back
8037944 its kind of the same thing that happened to me in high school i had to just be patient in high school too my time is gonna come
8037945 lets keep working hard and be patient listen to the coaches take the coaching listen to the upperclassmen and i should be in good shape
8037946 the first week the hardest thing was learning the steps im used to in high school just running straight to the hole not taking any steps
8037947 coach haywood is such a perfectionist he wants it done the right way and i think thats a good thing because my thought process as soon as i get out of the huddle is steps reads all these things its helped me become a better player and a more complete running back
8037948 its hard early on just because so much is expected of you back home you come here and its kind of a reality check
8037949 you really do have to kind of settle down and just be patient its a long 12 game season so as my shot comes ill do whatever i can during that time but right now im just trying to do whatever i can to help the team out
8037950 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

8037966 we did it first ken explained how he used the nz model from cantatech and the taranaki experiment of the one teacher primary schools from strathmore to taumarunui to introduce distance learning to new foundland because rural schools are not able to provide high class teachers for all of the subjects they would like to offer distance learning is the method used to help rural schools survive it requires collaboration in canada as in new zealand rural schools are struggling to attract the high quality teachers they need for all of the different subjects students want to study and to prevent the exodus of students to larger city schools distance learning has been introduced ken ran a programme in new foundland for two years before the canadian government intervened to find out what was involved and then took on the programme and developed it into the nation wide system used now physically small schools have become large institutions via internet and virtual space virtual classrooms are connected and collaborative onsite and online instruction is given open teaching and learning m teacher onsite mediator we call then vc co ordinators or dl co ordinators e teacher teacher of an online class

8037972 if i was carrying nail clippers and forgot about them i wouldnt have gotten so upset but here i was just wearing my underwear
8037973 this has been a cause for worry and has been unfortunate that successive governments have neglected the prisons system
8037974 the yellow ribbon program provides a paradigm shift where and how we can understand where they prisoners are coming from
8037975 we had all three provincial administrators from the three provinces in cakaudrove bua and macuata and weve also had team leaders for all the teams who will visit the different rural villagers
8037976 all team leaders have been instructed to read the documents and study carefully the issues contained within and they will also be briefing the turaga ni koros

8037981 i think were still at that point where jeff has some options we dont really know how bad it is were going to look at it and it probably will be through this weekend where it gets sorted out
8037982 it could be the type of thing where hell be back next week or it could be something major where he needs surgery but we dont know right now
8037983 certainly my prayers are with jeff and you have your fingers crossed
8037984 its pretty well documented how i feel about him and how the team feels about him and how important he is to the team and this offense were certainly hoping for good news
8037985 i did not like to see that the other day in the game and hopefully we can get some good news out of him
8037986 the coaches have really prepared us mentally its coming in getting ready the best we can and going out and playing as hard as we can
8037987 every single day you just have to be ready you never know whats going to happen to anybody so you always have to be prepared
8037988 if jeff isnt playing everybodys going to pick up their game a little bit but it still falls on the center
8037989 its one of those things that thats kind of how we practice and how we do things if jeff is not able to go well have some guys steve justice mike pollak jamey richard or ryan lilja whoever we decide to put in there theyll do a good job and theyll know whats going on
8037990 nobody remembers any autistic children in somalia im sure there must have been some but there were not that many
8037991 so alarmed by the number of somali children in her sons autism class that she started calling politicians news organizations and state officials to call attention to the issue
8037992 not only is it high among us here but we somalis dont accept this disorder
8037993 meanwhile the moment we get tired in the waiting gods spirit is right alongside helping us along if we dont know how or what to pray it doesnt matter he does our praying in and for us making prayer out of our wordless sighs our aching groans he knows us far better than we know ourselves knows our pregnant condition and keeps us present before god thats why we can be so sure that every detail in our lives of love for god is worked into something good

8038000 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
8038001 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
8038002 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
8038003 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election
8038004 its amazing how small businesses were the first to return to the city even as chain retailers were slow to reopen
8038005 theres a lesson for any community in distress after a disaster particularly in neighborhoods where residents are reluctant to return due to lack of services especially retail
8038006 theyve forgotten about us when weve been in business for so many more years
8038007 it was taken for granted that everything about the old new orleans should be erased and replaced with something shiny and new

8038016 peace is better than war and life is better than death
8038017 completely inconsistent with everything congressman paul has said that he stands for but unfortunately it is consistent with his record of pork barrel spending for the folks back home in his district
8038018 is trying to nab public money for 65 projects such as
8038019 a lot of the clinton camp want that kind of attack dog want that red meat to be thrown to the delegates theyre ready theyre ready for that fight the obama folks a little bit more laid back about it saying look you know were reaching across the aisle we want to reach out to the independents and some of the republicans a little less though of that red meat style
8038020 theres a little bit of concern about the fact that hes not going to be sort of go for the jugular the way that many democrats are hoping that they really step up here at this convention here in denver
8038021 he was talking not just about the audacity but the possibility of hope and thats a wonderful wonderful message to be carrying on hes so committed to health care hes so committed to national service hes committed to an honorable end to this horrific war
8038022 we endow them with the immortality that they so clearly deserve and yet here is the youngest brother the little engine that could that keeps going every single day adding something to our agenda adding something to this country

8038031 the gps units continue to be one of the hot commodities

8038035 they are now the objects of that very same anger and wrath of god that is expressed in the torments of hell and the reason why they do not go down to hell at each moment is not because god in whose power they are is not then very angry with them as he is with many miserable creatures now tormented in hell who there feel and bear the fierceness of his wrath yea god is a great deal more angry with great numbers that are now on earth yea doubtless with many that are now in this congregation who it may be are at ease than he is with many of those who are now in the flames of hell
8038036 obrien also listed two players who have left the program and will look to transfer elsewhere sophomore linebacker thomas barnes who played in 10 games last year as a true freshman and freshman defensive tackle kyle linney who enrolled in january after signing with the wolfpack in the spring of 2007
8038037 handing these guides out is a great way to both get noticed by freshmen while they experience new student orientation as well as promote liberty on your campus
8038038 grocers and other business owners who withhold payroll taxes from their employees paychecks hold that money in trust for the united states it is not theirs but satisfies their employees obligations to the government
8038039 when businessmen like mr cohen decide to steal their employees money instead of paying it over to the irs they face being investigated convicted and sentenced to prison they will also have a felony on their records for the rest of their lives as well as having to pay back all the money with interest and penalties
8038040 employers who withhold employment taxes from the salaries of their employees must pay those taxes over to the government failure to do so often results in consequences such as the sentence handed to mr cohen today
8038041 this mission will be the synthesis of many things but above all of three elements first residential infrastructure where the april 13 mission will engage in an integral urban transformation second synthesize the social missions in order to achieve a superior aggregate and in third place is the communal economy of social property which will bring productive forces to the barrio

8038044 the creep and gore factor are off the charts there were actually times during the scenes we shot in the woods that i got a little spooked myself this movie is going to deliver on every level its a horror fans dream
8038045 my love for horror flicks has been with me since i was a kid poltergeist and a nightmare on elm street are burned into my identity so when i was asked to be ripped open by the watcher in drive in horrorshow i jumped at the chance it was awesome and this movie will not disappoint any fan who enjoys the beauty of a perfect slasher flick
8038046 the tragic death of margaret and ken is no doubt our towns darkest chapter
8038047 the person responsible has destroyed our family they have taken from us a mum and a dad a grandma and a pop they have taken our friends and theyve taken our communitys innocence
8038048 our family and community will never be the same we now hope justice will take its course
8038049 this is a time to gather in support and grief
8038050 we thank god for margarets faith and prayer we are consumed by grief and pray that our hope will be restored
8038051 they were inseparable in life and will remain so in passing
8038052 our heartfelt thanks go to all the police particularly senior constable mark shaw and constable craig thompson who were with the family the night ken and margaret were found and our local detectives dan bishop and john robertson
8038053 my friends of course it wouldnt be mccain without those two words let me present to you my pick for the next vice president of the united states
8038054 there is a growing consensus in america that we need to overcome narrow partisanship on this issue for both women in need and the unborn
8038055 going forward we want to develop a system whereby one card can be used across all the systems which means transit and non transit also we want to introduce competition and hopefully bring down the cost for commuters
8038056 dont you ever feel like theres something at this school thats evil
8038057 i couldnt stand it if they took it out on you
8038058 nicollette sheridan and michael bolton have amicably ended their engagement they appreciate your respect for their privacy in this matter
8038059 i consider this proposal to be of national significance it is relevant to new zealands obligations to the global environment in terms of the kyoto protocol
8038060 in addition the proposal will have direct physical effects on more than one region in this case the franklin and waikato districts and the waikato region in terms of security of electricity supply the proposal will have potential effects beyond these areas
8038061 basically it will depend on how many they need to make the project economically viable
8038062 depending upon the final proposal there might be one or two south of forest trail
8038063 since ive been telling people theyve just been appalled at it
8038064 we think its quite exciting to bring this concept to the great lakes
8038065 toronto hydro already has some experience with wind power we think theres a really good opportunity because the great lakes have already proven to be a possible location
8038066 there is also a desire for greener and cleaner energy
8038067 in the lake front here its not that windy a place
8038068 im not against windmills at all i just have environmental concerns
8038069 the real issue is its going to cost tens of thousands of dollars
8038070 i think its a very good opportunity for the state government to partner with a highly regarded organisations
8038071 its like winning a heat at the olympics you dont jump for joy at the heat you wait for the final
8038072 no we didnt jump for joy when we heard about this but were not displeased however we recognise there is a long way to go
8038073 we are in the process of actively recruiting to all vacancies including new positions as a result of these service enhancements
8038074 a worldwide shortage of specialist mental health medical staff which makes recruiting psychiatrists in particular to a regional area like the illawarra challenging
8038075 acute mental health care and inpatient facilities are provided across the area on a networked basis with inpatient facilities based at shellharbour and wollongong hospitals
8038076 currently the areas priority is to enhance community mental health services in the shoalhaven to provide the necessary supports for people outside of the hospital setting
8038077 by enhancing community based services we aim to improve the quality of peoples lives by supporting them in their homes helping them stay well and reducing the need for acute services
8038078 a community mental health team an older persons specialist mental health team and a specialist adolescent mental health team operate in the shoalhaven
8038079 in addition two specialist clinical nurse consultants are based at shoalhaven district memorial hospital providing specialist services to the emergency department and the general hospital

8038086 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
8038087 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8038088 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8038089 it was only one sentence it could have been a bit more than one sentence but it was appreciated
8038090 they seem to be round the wrong way but yes i can see the resemblance
8038091 i will not discuss anything outside of my mourning and sympathy for the upshaw family
8038092 i struggled to find the words to articulate my appreciation for the experience of working intimately with one of the greatest union leaders in history
8038093 all who made sacrifices to advance the cause of the players

8038098 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8038099 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8038100 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8038101 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8038102 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8038103 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8038104 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8038105 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8038106 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8038107 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play

8038113 most indications are that gustav will be an extremely dangerous hurricane in the northwestern caribbean sea in a few days
8038114 im not too happy about it because i needed to get paid today
8038115 i knew it was coming but i was hoping to be out before it came
8038116 singaporeans are practical people it makes sense to communicate well at work but some of us dont want to come across as stand offish if we speak proper english in an informal setting this is a view we want to change
8038117 i dont see how speaking proper english will help me earn more money so why should i bother as long as people understand me its enough
8038118 i dont want it its noise that is not there now why would i want it
8038119 i live there you dont what about the value of my home
8038120 if you dont put up a pole and study it how do you know what kind of wind youre going to have
8038121 the sewer plant is here and i can hear the motor when the windows are open
8038122 youre color coding it and youre making it sweet noise travels
8038123 at night i can hear the crickets whats in it for me im a resident dont i have rights
8038124 im not here to fight with you sir im just here to provide information
8038125 ice falls off a lot of things and it would fall off this thing too
8038126 weve tried to find objective information although we did not make any conclusions we tried to provide objective information so the community can understand were going to tell you what has been done around the world
8038127 i remember seeing that in the paper and being terribly amused by that
8038128 wait a minute wait a minute you think im trying to lie to you
8038129 im worried we are going to lose valuable waterfowl people come for all over new england to see
8038130 when you put up a house you kill more than that
8038131 youre going to kill them all youre going to kill all the birds in the pond
8038132 birds are not stupid birds know the path to follow
8038133 i ask people to really search their soul think about the future if we dont take it upon ourselves to act its never going to happen
8038134 the momentum since that in my opinion has fallen off
8038135 we dont have the capacity to be looking after babysitting people waiting to be transferred to an acute mental health facility
8038136 trying to get a patient in to see mental health services in this region is extremely difficult
8038137 we feel very strongly that it does a good job not a comprehensive job but a very good job of informing the public of the health and safety concerns surrounding a project like this
8038138 i cant say enough about the people who worked on this report they were very dedicated
8038139 this report focuses on health and safety concerns of wind turbines rather than positive impacts of renewable energy and the motivating effect that development of wind energy in barrington might have on surrounding communities
8038140 they did a very nice job compiling worldwide information the renewable energy research laboratory was also very helpful theyre a neutral academic source
8038141 to date all but one of the documented injuries from wind turbines have been associated with accidents involving wind industry workers and not structural failure
8038142 interior noise either inside dwellings or in the high school itself is estimated to be well below who and american national standards institute standards only with windows closed
8038143 bat mortality at wind farms appears to be higher than bird mortality and in the eastern u s averaged between 21 and 48 fatalities per turbine per year
8038144 the u s fish and wildlife service recommends avoiding placement of turbines or turbine arrays in known areas of high bird or bat concentrations
8038145 it wasnt just barking at the horse it came running up to us and savagely attacked and kept attacking

8038160 ive watched the vmas in the past and the presenters are always like these mega stars like jamie foxx jennifer garner
8038161 and now you know for me to be doing that im really lucky and excited and looking forward to it
8038162 ive watched some of the videos this year and one of my favorites thats going to be up as a nominee is chris browns forever
8038163 its a really really cool video and chris brown hes like an acrobat like me i do a lot of flips and tricks and he does too
8038164 the title of the new album is folie deux it means the shared madness of two thank you dictionary com
8038165 its not an overtly political record but im not gonna say what it is
8038166 and i also wouldnt say its not a political record its just one of those things
8038167 well just let the record speak for itself but it is coming out on election day
8038168 weve done a little bit of the campaign for this record already where we came up with this idea because weve liked a couple of viral campaigns that had happened in the past but then we realized we didnt have the money or the time to hire those publicity firms to do it for us
8038169 so we came up with this idea to create an autocratic overbearing big brother organization that had these sort of vague messages like change is here
8038170 laurel miss federal officials said tuesday nearly 600 suspected illegal immigrants were detained in a raid on a manufacturing plant in southern mississippi making it the largest such sweep in the country
8038171 my favorite is the black raspberry chip it has an intense raspberry flavor with huge chunks of milk chocolate throughout its their no 1 brand that they mail nationally
8038172 sure its rich with 2 cups of heavy cream but dont skim youd be sorry just get some extra exercise the next day
8038173 theyve run a model franchise and i think everyone in pittsburgh recognizes how proud they are of the steelers and we in the nfl recognize how fortunate we have been to have dan rooneys leadership and now arts leadership
8038174 that is certainly a consideration the ownership of other clubs wants to make sure this team is going to be run consistently with those principles and if dan rooney wants an opportunity to continue to run the franchise i think thats an interest that some of the owners have
8038175 but i think these are issues because of their complexity and because theres clear emotional issues here we have to be patient but firm with respect to getting these resolved
8038176 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
8038177 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
8038178 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
8038179 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
8038180 the nearest swimming pool for me is a long drive away and so is the nearest badminton court which requires days of advance booking
8038181 in terms of per capita expenditure sweden and singapore probably spent as much money as we have but the key difference is that we have spent most of our limited funds on competitive sports while others have spent theirs on public sporting facilities that are less capable of generating gold medals
8038182 tennessee has a proud role in the history of womens suffrage
8038183 the republican party celebrates those who have sacrificed and fought to permit great women to vote and to serve in elected roles
8038184 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8038185 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8038186 we hope to make torchwood a gripping and surprising tv event with storylines that push our team into greater danger and sacrifice
8038187 joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
8038188 the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race
8038189 phooey pig go bill clinton should form bull hawg party
8038190 when that happened i thought wow there probably are things i could learn about safety
8038191 i havent been on a bike in years and even when i did it wasnt in traffic
8038192 im getting hammered by mayors asking what are you doing about all these new bikers on the street and nobody knows the rules of the road
8038193 says robert raburn executive director of the east bay bicycle coalition in oakland when the organization started classes in 2003 it offered maybe two a year now it has six slated for september with two more to be announced
8038194 biking kind of gives me a sense of independence im not dependent on fossil fuels
8038195 what we are really pushing for is more education both for cyclers and cars we have cyclists riding down wrong ways in bike lanes and drivers not looking when they are turning or opening doors
8038196 im in favor of this idaho rolling stop rule because you dont have to come to a complete stop to be completely safe
8038197 on a bicycle you are only really endangering yourself when you speed through an intersection while thats certainly not true when you are in a car
8038198 it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance
8038199 i dont care how late you were up last night we dont count hours in this business we only count men and the credit they bring in so if you want to eat youd better get ready to work
8038200 ah sir she can barely contain her excitement to see you
8038201 come right this way you will be the first with her this afternoon and i know how you men enjoy being first
8038202 i must go wake the kitchen help as soon as hes had his turn with her hell be wanting tea
8038203 good ill want to be sure no one sees you leave my house
8038204 she moaned as inch by inch his thick shaft entered her body
8038205 but heres what you couldve done if youd been a little more intentional and aware
8038206 pour toi acacita qui a fait pousser ce livre dans mon ventre
8038207 i will not leave government house until there is any political change
8038208 if they want to take me out they will have to kill me and drag my body out of here
8038209 they want bloodshed in the country they want the military to come out and stage a coup again
8038210 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on with their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
8038211 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
8038212 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
8038213 the u s a isnt on the short term radar as an anticipated market for us but with the right product it would be good to return there
8038214 my superiors were not happy the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either
8038215 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
8038216 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8038217 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
8038218 many monasteries in italy are dying because of a lack of religious vocations
8038219 the worst thing that could happen like an axe blow to the plane
8038220 youd have one motor pushing ahead and the other dragging in the opposite direction
8038221 as the md 82 plane has both engines on the tail close to the spine of the aircraft
8038222 i noticed the plane perhaps lacked speed then a wing dipped i clung to my seat and dont remember any more
8038223 it was something personal between two individuals in the county
8038224 theyd rammed each others vehicles or something and i think one of them got out and shot the others motor or tires
8038225 yes i will put all my energy at the service of my beliefs
8038226 we have to propose an alternative path to the french to balance our public finances and increase investment
8038227 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was
8038228 the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
8038229 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft
8038230 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
8038231 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
8038232 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
8038233 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8038234 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
8038235 the first thing we do in these situations is divert to safety
8038236 the crew cant be making passenger pa announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8038237 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off
8038238 the mind of a woman in love is operating at the
8038239 support obama or you are not supporting me and what i stand for
8038240 no i am not going to walk you through it it was a confidential process
8038241 a clear message that the jury wants these parties to fight in the marketplace and not in the courtroom we are disappointed that they awarded any damages however it is a rebuke to mattels aggressive and overreaching tactics
8038242 in texas the president of the university of the incarnate word in san antonio has signed the initiative so did pat obrien president of west texas a amp m in canyon
8038243 i am not encouraging teenagers to drink that is not why i signed it
8038244 we have a drinking problem in the nation on college campuses the current law does not resolve it
8038245 the most practical way as adopted in most countries im aware of is to leave the decisions to the local level but constitute the ethics committee properly
8038246 should include members from outside the hospital as well as doctors and non doctors
8038247 let us see how when we have fully wrapped up the case in the courts to see whether there are better ways of doing it
8038248 investigators have assumed that asthma is not a complication of pediatric hiv infection because studies conducted before haart was introduced in the mid 1990s did not detect the problem
8038249 it was not until the era of haart which restored the t cell levels that an increased incidence of asthma was noted
8038250 the nations founders staked everything on creating a country where there would be no taxation without representation anywhere in america in that tradition democrats proudly support the vote in congress for the 600 000 citizens of our nations capital
8038251 we will keep the promise made to the unknown soldier who was the first to die from the district in the war against taxation without representation and we will keep that promise for 21 year old d c national guard specialist darryl dent the first d c resident to die for his country in iraq
8038252 if george bush wont sign the d c voting rights act its most prominent co sponsor our next president barack obama will
8038253 its another opportunity to underscore the importance of voting rights for the district to see norton up there and for this issue to reach this level its incredibly important
8038254 its also an opportunity for her to let the nation know how close we are
8038255 la compa a rob de una manera consciente a sus clientes muchos de ellos pobres o que hab a muerto recientemente al dise ar y aplicar esas transferencias
8038256 enterraron la informaci n y continuaron con esa pr ctica ilegal
8038257 this has potential as time goes on to turn into a much bigger mess
8038258 we do not think it would be prudent to offer an advisory opinion on an international agreement between two nations in a case where it will have no practical effect
8038259 the minors presence in russia makes it impossible for us to fashion an effective remedy moreover the effective dates of the challenged orders have passed and fathers subsequent conviction for murder makes it extremely unlikely the minors will return to this country under the provisions of the treaty
8038260 im just a celebrity but i came as a working mom im supporting the hrc im also a friend of the family of the lgbt community and im a big supporter of civil rights for everybody
8038261 si no sab as cu ntas casas posees no sorprende que pienses que la econom a est s lida
8038262 est desconectado no creo que se da cuenta de lo que atraviesan los estadounidenses de a pie no creo que la administraci n bush se da cuenta de lo que atraviesan los estadounidenses
8038263 tendremos un gobierno que asegurar que los trabajadores no corren riesgos innecesarios
8038264 la mayor fuerza en pro del bien en la tierra
8038265 tenemos que enviar un mensaje claro a rusia y unir a nuestros aliados los rusos no pueden cargar contra otros pa ses por supuesto ser a mejor si nosotros di ramos ejemplo de eso
8038266 al final confundir esos temas solo lleva a m s problemas a la violencia y la agresi n
8038267 como defensor de los oprimidos y una fuerza de bien
8038268 yes theres some wounds yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about
8038269 the entrenched powers of the bush cheney years have everything to gain from keeping things just the way they are they will pull out all the stops to elect john mccain because they know hell keep looking out for them
8038270 but i have news for them their days are numbered
8038271 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8038272 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect barack obama
8038273 west virginians value hard work patriotism and faith in god they mine the coal make the steel and work the assembly lines that make our industries tick their experience and knowledge has earned each of them a ph d in life they can shake your hand look you in the eye and touch your heart
8038274 and let me tell you something they cant afford four more years like the last eight they need and deserve better from washington
8038275 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8038276 mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy 11 times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up
8038277 i think this report is in response to the concerns expressed by some residents
8038278 what this report does is give us good information for the health and safety issues for those two sites the committee for renewable energy in barrington will digest this and come up with recommendations
8038279 shocked that the high school would be the target for the installation
8038280 in terms of the report we didnt cut any corners even if we had another month i dont think it would have made any difference
8038281 one of the things i came away with was that we really dont know there is no good data for new england
8038282 im really kind of struggling with the whole thing because it could be bad for the birds but on the other hand this is a good form of energy personally i have not fallen on one side or the other i dont know i really dont know ive been going back and forth with this throughout the process
8038283 if we had a better sense of what was going to happen that would be different but there isnt a lot of information on these wind turbines on the east coast the bat mortality information was found almost by accident
8038284 you would really have liked to understand it a little more i dont think theres been enough time to look at all the different ways to investigate this i think everybody wishes they could think about it and spend a little more time on it
8038285 a task like this will take as long as you give it
8038286 there is a certain balance between moving deliberately and carefully and getting the job done
8038287 strong preference for siting the wind turbine at legion way
8038288 by putting more energy into exploring the legion way site it is beginning to look less feasible or less likely that the high school site will be able to withstand the necessary scrutiny associated with this project
8038289 i dont think theres any doubt that this report is devastating to the high school location
8038290 now that mr guida has the report the school committee should take a vote to say that the wind turbine will not be allowed at the high school its just too dangerous
8038291 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8038292 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8038293 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8038294 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8038295 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8038296 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8038297 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8038298 minnesota will love joe biden when they get to know him i can just see him up on the iron range right now he has blue collar roots hes a very warm person
8038299 the guys wont see you and the tide is not so high and i will be your watchman
8038300 for god sake arent you the hr director havent you ever done a transfer for a sales person
8038301 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels
8038302 if you force assad to choose to leave the alliance with tehran first as a condition for u s support for the peace talks hell never do it
8038303 you have to offer a slow choice he will gradually discover he doesnt need the alliance with iran
8038304 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
8038305 we the peoples should never let the law interfere with our right to run the court of the publics opinion
8038306 have i got an opportunity for you imagine being able to reach out to your exact target audience and influence their conversation about your product or service
8038307 how do i correlate these advertisements directly to my sales
8038308 you cant this is a new form of engagement advertising which is changing the way your customers interact with your brand
8038309 since your name is facebook well give it a shot with 5 million in advertising and see how it goes if good results are produced perhaps well try it out again
8038310 we are getting great client feedback and many have returned to run new campaigns
8038311 most every ad agency in the u s and europe are still 100 attached to impressions and clicks
8038312 they are becoming less scared of non traditional clicks such as contests groups virtual gifts etc but thats only because they can still tie it to a user and a click
8038313 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8038314 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8038315 study links increasing fuel costs to steep drop in traffic fatalities
8038316 report no umtri 2008 39 the university of michigan transportation research institute ann arbor michigan july 2008
8038317 listen to me carefully meet lieutenant giyas tonight at 9 30 sharp hell be at royal garden waiting for you

8038319 thats all what if i get caught and if i do this im home free
8038320 if you get caught its all over youll know whatll happen to you once you see the contents
8038321 you go back to your miserable little life you have my word
8038322 one more thing where do i find the motor cycle
8038323 well inform you tonight at 2 am till then keep the envelope safe
8038324 we are not trying to play god but we are trying
8038325 i think that boy wants money to buy a handphone
8038326 she is a peacock in paradise i am like a crow in the jungle
8038327 no doubt this is the most major change the judiciary has seen in the maldives history i welcome this big change
8038328 in the interests of public morals public order or national security where the interest of juveniles or a victims of a crime so require or in other special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice
8038329 unlike before anyone who wants to access court orders and case reports must be able to access them we never had a case reporting system so we are working on setting up such a system
8038330 when we examined the enabling bill the criminal procedures regulation is not given legal standing
8038331 we have noted clauses in the current legislation that contradict the constitution and changed them accordingly
8038332 the judges are independent and subject only to the constitution and the law when deciding matters on which the constitution or the law is silent judges must consider islamic shariah
8038333 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
8038334 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
8038335 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
8038336 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
8038337 i have thrown these boxes away before on many occasions they are taken to thilafushi the waste disposal island
8038338 no dismissal procedures but has information relating to accommodation and the way i am supposed to dress
8038339 we are prepared to fight the case in court if necessary
8038340 this is very sad i believe the dismissal is only for personal reasons when they are firing people as they see fit
8038341 ali has good work ethics is well behaved and doesnt have any bad record senior staff are also very surprised such a harsh measure was taken
8038342 we do not think it is reasonable for tourism sector staff to be treated differently
8038343 there is an increase in costs but our employees satisfaction is more important for us than that cost
8038344 i would say that if there is a creature who could preferably sense a magnetic field it probably would be a cow
8038345 just like the needle on a compass they just line themselves up
8038346 sea turtles will do it and even the monarch butterfly navigates we feel that its because of the earths magnetic field
8038347 the contractors had a schedule but it was a very aggressive schedule that was established
8038348 when we say were going to do something we do
8038349 we wanted to make the experience for the traveler as easy as possible and not have them jumping through hoops going over ladders or under ladders
8038350 when we first opened in tortola in the british virgin islands i can remember there was a whole family of chickens living in the airport
8038351 era una donna che ogni tanto sbagliava che a volte di mattina o di sera da sola nel letto piangeva
8038352 the ringworm has manifested itself in the cats and just is spreading all over the place so were stopping the intake of animals
8038353 its a four week gestation period for it so we dont know how many are going to come down with it we do need foster homes anyone willing to deal with this its not real difficult
8038354 sadly to say 18 of the cats we were not able to keep due to the fact that we only have about ten cages for isolation
8038355 neuer alter judenhass beigesteuert mit dem ph nomen der nationalen sozialisten f r israel auseinandersetzt ich spoile mal und nehme die reaktion der gesandten an der israelischen botschaft in berlin ilan mor vorweg
8038356 gott beh te uns vor solchen freunden mit unseren feinden werden wir schon fertig wir brauchen die hilfe solcher leute nicht das ist v llig absurd
8038357 die israelische bev lkerung zu den t tern von heute oder stellten entr stet fest dass aus auschwitz angesichts der leiden der pal stinensischen bev lkerung nichts gelernt wurde
8038358 our country has been hijacked and the democrats were in on it we can see clearly now who the real stick up artists are and thats why we are in denver
8038359 the labor of love bone marrow and blood drive offers a quick and painless test for people of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds to help increase the likelihood for patients to find a life saving match
8038360 it would be an honor for the enid community to come out and show their support in the life saving event
8038361 were not asking for money were asking for bone marrow
8038362 were saying you might not match tallie but you might match somebody else
8038363 whoa this place sucks what i have the bomb how do i put it down
8038364 it has the potential to undermine the economies of the internet
8038365 the firefox plug in adblock which eliminates most display advertisements automatically and gives me the freedom to block flash and other annoying components of the web
8038366 microsofts addition though makes that a default setting within the browser
8038367 different countries have their own so called bible from the health ministry
8038368 in the us their western drugs may be very advanced but when it comes to complementary medicine or chinese herbs it takes more time compared to malaysia and thailand where some of the herbs may be widely used
8038369 this is meant for long term and serious players and it weeds out fly by night operators
8038370 were a young company and our pockets are not as deep as big boys like p amp g so weve got to strategise
8038371 unlike countries like the us chinaor india where the local demand is high singapores small domestic market spurs local smes to look beyond singapores shores for growth
8038372 when engaging in cross border trade smes need to protect themselves from the risks they may face like importers defaulting on payment and issues like political risks
8038373 oh i think its a great facility and ill be good to have something in structure from a year to year or every other year basis
8038374 theres the latest technology thats out whether that be steel whether that be genetics they can come and see whats going on to make them more money in agriculture
8038375 the farm economy is going very very well right now you hear a lot of things about the housing industry and how its down and so forth but the ag industry is up
8038376 as soon as this shows over three of these combines have to go immediately to the customers and theyll start harvesting with them in the next one to two weeks
8038377 no force was needed the individual surrendered himself which is exactly the way we would hope for in this case and exactly the way we train exactly the what we could hope for best solution we could hope for
8038378 the installation of this cable median even though its 200 000 a mile is very very cost effective its probably the most cost effective safety counter measure we can install in the state of iowa
8038379 it looks intrusive to a motorist driving down the roadway at 65 70 miles per hour but i think if they look at what the alternatives are i think theyll accept it
8038380 rod has been with us through our last two successful runs weve had and its good for the program to have that stability and continuity
8038381 lamont bilal and jason each brings something different to the program lamont gives us maturity while bilal and jason both bring a high energy and high work capacity to their two spots
8038382 you seem so amazing who the hell wouldnt want to be with you
8038383 you seem so amazing there must be something wrong with you
8038384 you know i really dont wonder why a guys single until he starts asking me why im single
8038385 with obama having opposed the war theres no real reason for demonstrations
8038386 radicals of the 60s dont get credit for what has happened for good in the democratic party
8038387 all this talk about 68 because we have a fascination with round numbers
8038388 our country is full of the wreckage of the 60s
8038389 there is a new social movement on a vast scale
8038390 these young people will plant seeds for the next twenty five years
8038391 he is losing he is gonna lose the electoral college
8038392 adobe as a software company has to figure out a way to make money as we move to web 2 0 where everything is online and everything is free
8038393 theres lots of competition in this area so how can it take its franchise photoshop and turn it into something usable
8038394 whats happening is this capability photos and videos is coming within the reach of everyman
8038395 the tools making it accessible need to be put into place as well they need to broaden their products to appeal to wider markets that doesnt mean dumbing them down but hiding their complexity making the controls easier
8038396 its early yet and we expect further speed improvements in the near term
8038397 tracemonkey can be used in developer builds now but you have to enable it using a hidden preference it will be enabled by default for firefox 3 1
8038398 firefox is about three times faster than firefox 2 in various javascript benchmarks
8038399 or make its performance less snappy than it should be for all sorts of advanced web apps image processing games spreadsheets word processors etc
8038400 mozillas new initiative uses an implementation technique called just in time compilation that delivers significantly greater speed
8038401 other languages like and vb net have been using this technique for a while but those languages have a design that is more conventional and easier to enhance applying this technique to javascript has been a challenge until now
8038402 this work also speeds up firefox and mozillas other xul xml user interface language based applications which use javascript for their user interface programming
8038403 it really enhances the xenapp technology that has been in the hands of fortune 500 companies for years
8038404 the major enhancement is really around what they are doing with the local streaming technology
8038405 every time you install an app you start to create dependencies you install one application and then another you can break things easily
8038406 okay dont panic you just had a really good drink go back to cleansing your hands
8038407 holy shit thats the coolest thing i had ever seen
8038408 hes nervous because hes the kind of guy that wants everyone to be pleased with his performance starting with himself hes a perfectionist
8038409 but i think when it comes down to the concepts that our people have asked him to understand the true xs and os that people have asked him to understand i think hes done an excellent job
8038410 a tremendous athlete someone whos willing to learn hes humble now
8038411 we had to show him a little bit that this is a different level and everybody starts from the bottom
8038412 i usually challenged him and talked junk he got mad a few times
8038413 i wouldnt hit him the way to test somebodys humbleness or where they are mentally is to challenge them verbally to see how they can handle people coming at them and how they handle pressure in a game a lot of guys talk junk you have to be able to just take it in stride and keep your cool at first he had a little trouble with it but hes fine now
8038414 the seniors must get after him pretty good because every once in a while ill get a text from him saying are we supposed to get up at 5 30 or is this another senior prank on me
8038415 our chief concern is that we never underestimate an opponent
8038416 are we going to have offsides are we going to have mental breakdowns are we going to stay together
8038417 because theres going to be crunch time in every game
8038418 i told the team i didnt want them to feel any pressure because i want them to be loose in every game
8038419 the trip out west to play in that january bowl game was just about the bowl game this is all about making an impression
8038420 a long time ago as a little kid i learned that the most lasting impression is your first impression so this needs to be a big first impression
8038421 i hope i remain the same guy ive got a nice bride at home whos going to make sure i dont crow too much and i got a 13 year old son who keeps me in line and friends in the business that wont let me forget who i am
8038422 it hasnt been that both have done bad or both have done great
8038423 its just that both have been very consistent the players rally around both of them
8038424 its a great situation for us both will be hungry to play and i want it that way i want them both to be very competitive but i also want both of them to know theyre on the same team
8038425 i guess well find out when everybody else finds out
8038426 yall know just as much as i know so well see
8038427 i know that im going to be out there and i know ill be playing so im not worried about it i think were both going to play
8038428 the thing about kodi is hes still in the learning mode
8038429 chris has been in this offense since diapers hes been running it forever without a big separation i think its great on kodis part to be able to catch up and learn chris has been a big part of that chris has been helping him out
8038430 we cant let this divide the team at all between me and chris weve got to stay strong as quarterbacks and not let our individual things get in the way of our team goals
8038431 were worried about what were going to do on saturday well let the offense handle their business
8038432 when they bury me are they going to put on my gravestone youre one win ahead of bobby bowden
8038433 its attainable if i stay healthy and whole and win like i should
8038434 its working out you dont have to be a genius to figure out that clark was the guy who should be the guy who developed to be number one
8038435 we have a fluid situation we have a nice situation
8038436 i still dont want to go into the season where you have a two quarterback or three quarterback system
8038437 i think clark ought to go in there and have a little fun playing
8038438 were out here trying to educate people about ideas for real change
8038439 its just time to let this theme go its from another era in our history and its time it had some new life and new meaning
8038440 isaiah and i were back and forth with a few variants of r7 to make sure that 2hadow and yourhead plugins would play nice together under normal use
8038441 this version should do the trick making 2hadow stable enough to be let loose in the open source pool
8038442 lets say this im not going with the quick hook
8038443 hell yes i have a fear of it thats why i dont sleep very well even after ive seen it in games i wonder if its going to show up the next game
8038444 dare tanto amore ed affetto a ki almeno x1attimo nn mi abbia distolto lo sguardo da altro
8038445 se la persona a cui tieni di piu spicca il volo se la ami davvero e tieni a lei piu di ogni altra cosa la lascerai andare
8038446 det er der s meget andet der ogs g r
8038447 foi uma aventura que come ou ap s um epis dio triste e se transformou em alegria
8038448 eu estou muito feliz porque deu tudo certo um grande al vio que ela tenha completado a volta e chegado em casa com seguran a estava muito preocupado que algo desse errado
8038449 sto meglio se dalle pressioni di madrid si e passati a quelle di londra
8038450 questo non lo posso dire dice sorridendo ndr perche se qualcuno mi ha promesso ad abramovich non sono stato io ovviamente scherzo io ho sempre detto che sono contento al milan e finche il mio obiettivo e lo stesso del milan io rimango qui finora e sempre stato cosi il mio traguardo assicura e quello di vincere quello del milan pure e si vede anche dagli sforzi che sta facendo la societa in questo senso rinforzando la squadra e facendo in modo che questa sia sempre una squadra vincente finche siamo cosi io restero al milan
8038451 sheva e un caso un po particolare perche faceva parte del gruppo e andato via e ora e tornato ma in ogni caso tutti si inseriscono molto bene e credo che non ci sara nemmeno problema per sheva di ritrovarsi e riadattarsi lo spogliatoio del milan e sempre stato molto bello i giocatori sono di esperienza sono vincenti non ci sono problemi di gelosie nessuno che fa casino credo aggiunge che alla fine sia questo il punto di forza di questo milan avere un gruppo cosi forte
8038452 non sarebbe male giocare con i miei connazionali pero io sogno un milan ono nel processo finale della cura e della terapia mancano solo pochi giorni per finire la parte della fisioterapia poi potro cominciare a fare la preparazione e a mettermi a posto per cominciare la stagione
8038453 penso che dopo la sosta saro pronto per cominciare a giocare
8038454 diciamo che non mi spiacerebbe nemmeno vincere la coppa uefa dice questo gruppo ha vinto tutto quello che poteva vincere questanno ci tocca la uefa se la vinciamo non sarebbe male pero si lobiettivo principale sara vincere lo scudetto
8038455 eh succede anche questo pero ce da dire che il vero ritrovo del milan non ce stato non abbiamo mai giocato e non ci siamo mai allenati con tutti i giocatori che fanno ora parte della rosa alcuni prosegue kaka sono arrivati e poi sono andati alle olimpiadi altri sono arrivati dopo basti pensare che deve arrivare ancora senderos sheva e appena arrivato solo ora la squadra comincia a creare unidentita a prendere forma in ogni caso speriamo di continuare a restare imbattuti in italia durante tutto questanno
8038456 la squadra da battere per quel che ha fatto in questi anni poi certo ce la juve che si e rinforzata questanno giochera anche la champions e puo fare un grande campionato e poi ce sempre la roma che e una squadra che gioca molto bene queste saranno le avversarie del milan durante la stagione poi ce sempre qualche sorpresa la fiorentina che e una squadra che gioca ormai insieme da tanto tempo e lanno scorso ha fatto un grandissimo campionato e puo sicuramente ripetersi anche questanno poi vedremo se ci saranno altre sorprese
8038457 mi ha confortato un po questo infortunio al ginocchio se finora non sono riuscito a curarmi e a stare bene vuol dire che non ero pronto neanche per andare a fare i giochi per il resto prosegue il brasile deve sempre giocare per vincere quindi il bronzo pur essendo una medaglia non conta come quello che tutti si aspettavano in ogni caso io credo che sia una bella impresa perche era da tanto che il brasile non riusciva a prendere una medaglia olimpica nel calcio maschile pero ci manca sempre loro
8038458 sia una cosa normale anche se la trovo brutta poi chiaro il calcio e sempre lo sport di cui tutti parlano anche se poi le olimpiadi girano intorno a tante altre cose tanti altri sport e tanti altri atleti
8038459 i have become thinner after losing5 kilos look at my waistline now i have to tighten my belt by four notches i now look more handsome than before theres no more pot belly
8038460 i think everybodys saying oh they dont deserve to be in the top 10
8038461 weve just got to go out there and prove them wrong
8038462 it doesnt take a rocket scientist to look at the last couple of years and see three or four plays that kept us
8038463 we need to know where we stand right now our goal is to win the national championship
8038464 mondays meeting with the team will be awfully important one way or another
8038465 for the sake of the kids knock on wood we can keep that going and keep these guys able to play camp was very physical and very aggressive and the guys were able to handle it we were in great shape to handle the workload and its showed up and paid off for us so hopefully well continue

8038467 c j gable came flying he had a great day of practice yesterday
8038468 he was at full speed and was on a mission to prove that he was full speed hes not missing this game we all thought he was in big big trouble but he just wouldnt hear of it
8038469 i feel great ive been healthy for a week and a half
8038470 it was definitely a frustrating experience i learned a lot about medicine how it works it was scary at times i had a real high fever bad stuff i was on antibiotics for 10 days they said that should kill the bacterial infection they werent letting me do anything
8038471 i cant remember going into the opener with the team pretty much intact luck helped
8038472 its a big time football game we expect its going to be a very difficult game were holding nothing back were not resting anybody and were not going to get somebody ready for a couple weeks from now were going for it and thats the only way we know how to do it
8038473 we have a lot of similarities they are a a pretty classic as i would see it classic run and play action team its an nfl offense is what it is and an nfl 3 4 defense that al groh brought from his years in the league
8038474 coach grohs team looks a lot like the patriots the jets teams he was a part of
8038475 this is a sign that people want change that they want to be taken care of and the price of petrol will go down when we go to putrajaya

8038509 for life is more than food and the body more than clothing

8038606 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgian brigade weve been able to achieve this success because of an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence

8038613 his words appeared to rule out the presence of any u s military advisors special forces and air support after the withdrawal date
8038614 a direct challenge to the bush administration which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground
8038615 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8038616 than an agreed upon 2011 date is for combat forces only
8038617 despite the tough words aides insisted a compromise could be found on the two main stumbling blocks to an accord governing the u s military presence in iraq after a united nations mandate expires at the end of the year

8038619 a police official says the bomb was planted in a car parked on a street used by local government officials going to work
8038620 but it is usually the job of the party nominee to build unity once a vanquished rival has conceded and made the right gestures unless the loser happens to be a woman then its just like high school and she must do the work
8038621 we must have an opposition party in this country and the green party with over 200 elected officials on the local level can be that opposition but we have to expand and broaden the green party to reflect the entire fabric of all of the communities that are in this country we have done a great job of reaching out to people of all diverse backgrounds and we wanted to make sure that people understood that not only is green party a viable alternative it is imperative

8038629 up to 65 000 passengers a day are now using terminal 5 a number that has risen steadily from 40 000 a day in april passengers are extremely happy with terminal 5 which is working well and provides an experience vastly superior to the rest of heathrow it is not surprising if other airlines are envious
8038630 its ironic that just as regulators are breaking up one monopoly baa british airways and american airlines are trying to create another
8038631 our results prove that consumers want choice on transatlantic routes unless the regulators block the proposed ba aa monopoly consumers will lose out and theyll pay higher ticket prices for the privilege
8038632 a heap of growers emu and ostrich growers put in quite a lot of money to upgrade the abattoirs and unfortunately it fell over and we lost a lot of money on that

8038634 however when we expandedto thailand and hong kong the demand for an international quality publication became more strident
8038635 we needed to spruce up our design quality to match publications from united states and europe
8038636 our brief was to design a product that is not only elegant and sophisticated but also cutting edge sounds simple enough but our local talent then had the potential but lacked the exposure and theadventurous streak

8038652 i love the chipotle for its intense smokiness and heat i loved canned chipotle in adobo and i found this bag of golden morita chipotles in the kitchen at de santo which i steeped in sherry vinegar i sprinkled the flavored vinegar on all kinds of things
8038653 to cook with habaneros you have to cut them theyre hot as hell you want to extract the flavor but it comes with the heat sweetness balances them out i also use them for garnish theyre pretty
8038654 a purple green fresh they taste like a red pepper but a little spicy

8038662 the jewish people as a whole will be its own messiah it will attain
8038663 great strength of thought and insight its design is well above the abilities of an ordinary mind it is more complicated than a nuclear bomb
8038664 his majestys government views with favor the establishment in palestine of a national home land for the jewish people and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non jewish communities in palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by jews in any other country
8038665 as birds flying so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem defending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve it
8038666 large numbers of jews almost amounting to a second exodus have been migrating from eastern europe to the american zones of germany and austria with the intention in the majority of cases of finally making their way to palestine it is clear that it is a highly organized movement with ample funds and great influence behind it but the subcommittee was unable to obtain any real evidence who are the real instigators

8038671 the arab people want to fight we have been waiting for the right time when we will be completely ready
8038672 we are facing you in battle and are burning with desire for it to start to obtain revenge
8038673 we feel the soil of palestine is the soil of egypt and the whole arab world why do we mobilize because we feel that the land of palestine is part of our land and we are ready to sacrifice ourselves for it
8038674 we have returned to our holiest of holy places never to be parted from it again no power on earth will remove us from this spot again
8038675 if russia disturbs the balance of power in the middle east the united states will move to assure israels security

8038677 i can say without reservation as president of the united states of america that we will continue to do so remain committed to israels security not just for thirty years but forever
8038678 now we accept the formation of the palestinian state in part of palestine in the gaza strip and west bank we will start from that part and we will liberate palestine inch by inch
8038679 the plo recognizes the right of the state of israel to exist in peace and security
8038680 our first goal is the liberation of all occupied territories and the establishment of a palestinian state whose capital is jerusalem the agreement we arrived at is not a complete solution it is only the basis for an interim solution and the forerunner of a final settlement which must be based on a complete withdrawal from all occupied palestinian lands especially holy jerusalem
8038681 there is a state which was established through historical force and it must be destroyed this is the palestinian way
8038682 all the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasure of the kings house
8038683 all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of the lord
8038684 to keep the road from the coast to jerusalem free from bandits
8038685 except for the ark and the tablets in it this jeremiah preserved
8038686 the mountain where moses went up and beheld the heritage of god
8038687 in principle i agree that the ark should be returned to the temple but the correct time has not yet come
8038688 his seat in the temple of god displaying himself as being god 2 thessalonians 2 4 see also rev 11 1
8038689 in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that is fallen and close up the breaches thereof and i will raise up his ruins and i will build it as in the days of old
8038690 the treasures of the first temple are under the mount and we know exactly where they are
8038691 we are at the stage where david was when he liberated jerusalem from that time until the construction of the temple by solomon only one generation passed so it will be with us
8038692 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers

8038712 saffc are a winning side and i guess sometimes it gets a little frustrating because i miss that feeling of winning titles
8038713 and i do miss the winning mentality of the warriors team
8038714 but i am enjoying my football here at geylang its also been a great learning experience for me getting to play alongside promising young players here like syed thaha and lau meng meng
8038715 with 11 games to go in the season i think we can even finish fourth if we really work hard for it
8038716 our recent good run of results has also helped us greatly and i think it has given the boys a real boost in confidence
8038717 i have one year left in my contract and we have a good bunch of lads here at the club so i am looking forward to helping the team do even better in the coming season
8038718 playing balestier is always a difficult proposition no matter their league position

8038720 he thought apparently the dvd case was a great spot to hide it from me and it was i didnt think to look there
8038721 we are obviously watching that because the concern we have raised is that the governments own task force is not going to report to the government til december and yet theyre proceeding to publish the second plan before theyve even finished that consultation
8038722 but most importantly to be able to determine which services are delivered in their community whatever the budget is
8038723 they must have the ultimate say on which of the services are to be delivered
8038724 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8038725 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8038726 we have been working closely with operators of airport and ferry terminals shopping malls furniture malls and owners of tourist attractions to provide chartered and shuttle taxi services at their doorsteps

8038729 kay hagan is trying to run a campaign in north carolina that casts her as a moderate but the money thats paying for it is coming from the left wing fringe of political thought
8038730 kay hagan does not represent the values of this state she is a trojan horse for a long list of wacky left wing outside groups bent on policies that would horrify most north carolinians if they knew about it
8038731 this latest revelation of support from anti religion activists will not sit well with the 90 of state residents who identify with a specific religious faith

8038737 we need her to send the message its time to move on
8038738 i am asking those of you who supported me i will be forever grateful to work as hard for barack obama
8038739 let us join together here let us remember what we were fighting for
8038740 we were not just fighting to elect a particular person president we were fighting to take our country back let us join hands we may have started out on different paths but we are on the same journey now that journey leads not just to the white house but to a better future for our families and children
8038741 when she said this is not about the candidate this about our country that touched me it will be hard for me not to vote now but it was her it was her she spoke to me not him

8038748 im not telling anyone how to vote it doesnt have to be unanimous
8038749 this is a very important feature of the agreement and shows that asean has decided to move as it indicated in the asean charter last year that asean will increasingly be a rules based regime
8038750 we are looking at a major paradigm shift in our processing of trade inputs
8038751 now that tariff variables in asean are very low more than 90 per cent of goods traded are zero per cent tariffs
8038752 we are now looking at how to remove and reduce some of the cumbersome documentation and trade procedures to facilitate business transactions
8038753 9 y es que te sent as muy bien dentro de los 18 metros del rea donde no todos se encuentran bien

8038755 rbi baseball were dancing in my head and instantly i was having a much better time playing the game the controls dont work 100 percent of the time but the mistakes and bad plays in the outfield are random enough and hardly cause much harm
8038756 power pros 2008 but then again you dont pick up a game like this as a
8038757 legend hand of god was a breakaway hit or an outright failure what makes it such an easy review is that i could not even get the game started yes thats right the game would never load

8038768 a tax exempt organization must make available for public inspection its approved application for recognition of exemption with all supporting documents available and its last three annual information returns
8038769 what im hoping they do is they look at this bill and know that this sort of thing is the right thing to do now and it is unfair to put building workers through another couple of years of the oppressive star chamber tactics of the abcc
8038770 we think it is a very harsh thing to do and we would encourage the school rather than just banning it outright to really look for some providers of developmental gymnastics programs give the kids a real learning experience on how to do these things safely
8038771 look ill have to have a look at that i wasnt the worlds sportiest kid
8038772 during that attack they had to deal with things like roof collapse and floor collapse the building was very badly damaged by the fire it took them about 45 minutes to control but during their operations they very very sadly and tragically located the body of a two year old child
8038773 the child that perished in the fire was one of five that were inside the house and they were staying with a grandparent
8038774 if theres anyone out there that is currently concerned they may be the subject of this particular investigation they are urged to come forward in the strictest confidence and contact crimestoppers
8038775 these allegations happened some 20 odd years ago there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that the college involved is has been looking to anything in the current day
8038776 the college involved has been cooperating with the police completely with this inquiry
8038777 it is absolutely a requirement for this matter to be open for this matter to be addressed and this matter to be resolved
8038778 its highly regrettable that the rudd government has chosen to embrace the flawed and discredited howard government funding model for schools
8038779 having embraced it the consequence of that decision and subsequent policies will result in a loss of funding a real cut in funding to public schools
8038780 what kind of education revolution would cut money to public schools
8038781 thats what our trade training centres in school are all about thats what the digital revolution is all about
8038782 there is additional money flowing to schools but there is much more to be done
8038783 we are also in a process of talking with the states about how we provide additional funding particularly to disadvantaged schools
8038784 weve got a whole variety of stunts and things that are intended to manage a 24 hour news cycle but we dont have real decisions which affect australians as far as their cost of living pressures
8038785 weve got no no clear strategic economic direction for the rest of this term of government and from our perspective mr rudd is now having us believe hes going to go to the press club and give us his direction for the country
8038786 the only things that the government has done since the election are the continuation or the implementation of howard government policies or symbolic things like ratifying kyoto and saying sorry in the parliament
8038787 he might as well be speaking mandarin for all the sense he makes
8038788 hes got to tell the australian people why he wants to raise a raft of new inflationary taxes when the government already has a huge surplus when inflation is elevated and every one of these taxes will put upward pressure on inflation
8038789 what we are doing is tackling inflation the imf has recognised that
8038790 the budget we brought down has put downward pressure on inflation
8038791 inflation has been fuelled in recent times by spikes in the oil prices and so on thats why we bought down the budget that we did
8038792 and the budget is reducing taxation as a share of gdp in the economy
8038793 it beggars belief that you can take 2 5 billion off the bottom line of a company like woodside and not have that passed onto australians in other ways
8038794 as far as im concerned hes been very supportive and working hard for the people of higgins
8038795 i dont believe that there is anyone who would do a better job in the current circumstances than brendan
8038796 weve got no policies lets just hold every budget measure up maybe itll make labor look bad
8038797 weve got a whole variety of stunts and things that are intended to manage a 24 hour news cycle but we dont have real decisions which affect australians as far as their cost of living pressures

8038805 in a facility like this the possibility for injury is enormous
8038806 its pretty standard to lose an eye lose a limb lose a life were going to have a government that makes sure workers arent put at unnecessary risk
8038807 the only things that the government has done since the election are the continuation or the implementation of howard government policies or symbolic things like ratifying kyoto and saying sorry in the parliament
8038808 he might as well be speaking mandarin for all the sense he makes
8038809 this is a person who is addicted to process as someone said during the week he hit the ground reviewing
8038810 were saying you know what penny please dont give up
8038811 if all parties in the senate want to see us saving the coorong and the lower lakes theyll support this motion
8038812 religious charities have had to knuckle under to the directives of the federal government if they wanted public money
8038813 planned parenthood receives bundles of federal money and hires only the like minded
8038814 sometimes you go to war with the media you have not the media you wish you had
8038815 the president has authority under the constitution to take action in order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the united states as congress recognized in public law 107 40
8038816 to take appropriate action in accordance with the constitution and relevant laws of the united states to bring iraq into compliance with its international obligations
8038817 its quite clear that this country needs a third political force made up of people all over the country who are committed to the proposition that corporations and their governments must become our servants not our masters as they are at the present time
8038818 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
8038819 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
8038820 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
8038821 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8038822 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it
8038823 areas such as the north kimberley coast are owned by aboriginal people and many of them are doing excellent work managing that country providing environmental services for all australians
8038824 its nieve to think all us humans will not have an impact on our planet
8038825 in a fun sort of way my relationship with george lucas is quite similar to that of a master and padawan hes a good mentor teaching me how he made star wars and i have been a student of his for the past three years
8038826 he was very excited and very involved in the project

8038834 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena

8038836 to gain our share of investments and jobs asean needs to become a well integrated community
8038837 we have to continue strengthening our economic foundations reducing tariff and non tariff barriers and simplifying business regulations
8038838 we are concerned with the emerging risks of stagflation this presents huge socio political as well as economic risks in the next three to five years opportunities may be limited in such a scenario
8038839 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months
8038840 its a proxy for economic growth we recently concentrated on the us and united kingdom primarily because we see value
8038841 and as a result we can ride through the storms
8038842 this may impact temaseks ability to divest its stake in various entities and manage its portfolio
8038843 keep in mind that the bar goes up each time and makes it more difficult to get over that hurdle
8038844 we are prepared to take opportunities in any part of the world
8038845 and above all fascism the more it considers and observes the future and the development of humanity quite apart from political considerations of the moment believes neither in the possibility nor the utility of perpetual peace war alone brings up to its highest tension all human energy and puts the stamp of nobility upon the people who have the courage to meet it
8038846 all men are enamored of decorations they positively hunger for them
8038847 we need a lot of battleships to war on this nation or that nation
8038848 eliminating the public sphere total liberation for corporations and skeletal social spending

8038854 produced dozens of stories that questioned the bush administrations claims about the need for war and exposed the serious reservations that many intelligence foreign service and military officers had about the rush to invade iraq
8038855 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier
8038856 i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages
8038857 we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
8038858 you are not my people and i am not your god
8038859 where it was said to them you are not my people they will be called children of the living god

8038862 it begins in the classroom while you are seated and ready to learn the educated negro has been taught to have contempt towards his own people and admire the hebrew greek latins and the teuton the teaching of the subject negro is either dismissed or thought of as having little consequences
8038863 this concept is the worst sort of lynching there would be no lynchings if it did not start in the classroom
8038864 covenant spice is dedicated to strengthening marriages and increasing playfulness and intimacy in your sex life
8038865 we are one of the only christian intimacy sites where no nudity means just that
8038866 covenant spice and other christian adult online sites are tapping into what was hitherto an ignored market conservative evangelical christians who also want more fun in the bedroom or on the kitchen counter or on the couch when the children are away

8038868 in reality st marys south brisbane has taken a roman catholic parish and established its own brand of religion
8038869 the response and support from across all social justice networks has been overwhelming
8038870 st marys is a church which takes seriously its identity as a catholic community and practices the teachings of the catholic church which call for homosexual persons be accepted with respect compassion and sensitivity
8038871 such acceptance calls for practical action which welcomes gay and lesbian people to the life and worship of the community
8038872 those who have concerns about our support for sexual minorities need to remember that the catholic church also teaches that every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided in this spirit the church has opened its doors to the brisbane lesbian and gay pride choir who use the church for weekly rehearsals as well as supporting the musical and religious culture at st marys
8038873 gay and lesbian catholics who prefer more traditional worship have always been a presence at the cathedral of st stephen where one of the beautiful stain glass windows is dedicated to a gay member of the famous mayne family of brisbane

8038879 they apparently went out to the boat to mess with the person they were going to go out and just trying to scare him however when they did go out driscoll entered that boat along with the other suspects driscoll was the one who went through this cabin after he apparently went through this cabin he was stabbed by the occupant
8038880 whether driscoll had it in his mind that he was going to go out there and severely beat this person or just go out and damage the property were just not going to know that

8038885 our next president will have a mandate to build an enduring global peace on the foundations of freedom security opportunity prosperity and hope
8038886 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8038887 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8038888 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8038889 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8038890 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8038891 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment

8038909 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
8038910 ayers is clearly a relevant issue as it relates to obamas pattern of relationships
8038911 its hard to see how one actually could resolve having any sort of relationship with an admitted remorseless domestic terrorist
8038912 be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8038913 the last time obama saw ayers was about a year ago when he crossed paths with him while biking in the neighborhood
8038914 the suggestion that ayers was a political adviser to obama or someone who shaped his political views is patently false
8038915 im not pretending i drink to ignore my problems i spend more time with my computer than with my friends i dont have a very good relationship with men i am angry and lonely im being honest

8038935 the new census figures are a reminder of how important it is to ensure that all americans have access to affordable health coverage
8038936 nearly 46 million americans have no health coverage and remain vulnerable to financial disaster if a serious illness or accident strikes
8038937 this report shows how critical medicaid medicare and schip are in providing a safety net to americans who cant afford health coverage especially during tough economic times

8038961 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8038962 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
8038963 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8038964 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8038965 this show is about authenticity from the artists who visit us in the studio every week to the people watching at home

8038970 faculty have always assessed students in their classes to make sure they know how to do a particular skill but this is the first time were assessing particular outcomes targeted to each program every year college wide
8038971 well test two of the outcomes a year so we can assess all of them over the three years of the college plan
8038972 if the outcomes are negative we can recognize this year that we need to change something next year if we have good results well continue as is and assess two more outcomes
8038973 when you take the whole program youll have been exposed to all of these
8038974 if someone is just dropping in for a personal growth class in trigonometry they wont get data analysis but theyll get all the other four it is accountability over a whole program
8038975 if everyone in a program knows exactly what the students are supposed to learn everything can flow from that to meet your objectives
8038976 the goal is to be able to verify students are learning what we want them to learn regardless of the campus and to make changes if that isnt happening
8038977 total enrollment at pcc which is the sixth largest community college district in the u s is about 75 000 when non credit contract and adult education class enrollment is included
8038978 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8038979 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8038980 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8038981 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8038982 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8038983 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8038984 he did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working its entire history not just the skeletal stuff
8038985 any time you work anywhere you have to understand this history you just cant walk in and cowboy it pull some stuff out and draw conclusions in the absence of understanding the bigger picture

8039106 safety is unfortunately not a big part of the purchase decision of indian consumers
8039107 our best selling small cars are typically not the safest vehicles on the road because consumers are more worried about and the cost of ownership and would rather not pay for safety features such as air bags and anti lock brakes
8039108 we do believe the need for training is becoming increasingly relevant due to the increase in vehicle volumes high speed roads enhanced performance of vehicles and the requirement of specific skills for application vehicles
8039109 as more cars are sold there is a demand for more drivers transporters also want drivers for commercial vehicles where the need for training is perhaps most acute
8039110 tata has struggled with the fact that during the boom there werent enough experienced drivers which can actually dent demand for trucks

8039127 cari figli con amore materno vi voglio stimolare allamore verso il prossimo che mio figlio sia la fonte di questo amore lui che poteva fare tutto con la forza ha scelto lamore dando lesempio a voi anche oggi dio attraverso me vi trasmette limmensa bont e voi figli miei avete il dovere di rispondere ad essa con la stessa bont e generosit comportatevi con le anime che incontrate che il vostro amore le converta in questo modo mio figlio e il suo amore risorgeranno in voi vi ringrazio
8039128 i vostri pastori devono essere nei vostri cuori e nelle vostre preghiere
8039129 sono quasi imbarazzato nel darle del lei ha detto nellintroduzione alberto savorana portavoce di comunione e liberazione per quellamicizia che con don paolo ho condiviso fino adesso ci tengo a chiedergli che cosa ha generato il s di un giovane in servizio di leva allinvito di un commilitone chi avrebbe mai immaginato questo filo della storia
8039130 oggi don gius si compiace perch un suo figlio stato chiamato a collaborare affinch quel suo sogno giovanile di unit della chiesa di dio diventi realt
8039131 quando mi hanno chiesto di parlare a questo meeting ha esordito monsignor pezzi ho subito pensato a quando venticinque anni fa io montavo questo palco come volontario cera il mio amico aldo che teneva la supervisione sapeva tutto di come si doveva lavorare e io seguivo lui oggi sono a parlare da questo palco ma nella sostanza lo stesso
8039132 nella mia vita ho sempre cercato la risposta al mistero di dio ha continuato magari anche ingenuamente e incoscientemente ma ho scoperto con stupore un disegno buono sulla mia vita
8039133 dire s a cristo nellaccettare la nomina del papa come quando venticinque anni fa dicevo di s ad aldo che mi chiedeva di portargli una chiave numero cinque per montare il palco
8039134 per rispondere devo rimanere in rapporto con dio perch il s a cristo sempre un s a persone e circostanze concrete per questo mi interessava di pi il s che continuare a sognare circostanze favorevoli al mio temperamento ci che fa fiorire il deserto lofferta quotidiana perch anche la vita di tutti i giorni di un vescovo piena di cose aride ma questa unoccasione di protagonismo solo se si offre ogni cosa a cristo
8039135 gli dissi che lui rimaneva in monastero perch io potessi partire non si rimane infatti se non per partire e non si parte se non per rimanere solo rimanendo nello stupore ritrovo il gusto dellavventura della mia vita e della missione che ho imparato a gustare allinterno della fraternit san carlo borromeo e nel rapporto con don massimo camisasca
8039136 nel 1984 in occasione del trentennale del movimento ha raccontato scrissi a don giussani che ero cos grato dellesperienza vissuta da essere disposto ad andare ovunque nel mondo non avevo mai pensato alla russia se non per le affascinanti letture del samizdat partire per rimanere per me stata una condivisione di vita che oggi si riflette nellattirare uomini in un miracolo di comunione la vita si trasforma solo nellobbedienza ha aggiunto che la condizione secondo la quale tutto quello che fai esprime la comunione che affermi piegarsi alle circostanze invece che perseguire un proprio progetto
8039137 oggi ci si arresta a livello di analisi della situazione dimenticando qual la priorit e il punto di partenza per chi vive in cristo lecumenismo infatti landare verso laltro col desiderio di conoscere la verit in lui presente attraverso di me la presenza di cristo tende a diventare trasparente e questo lo posso vedere nella mia amicizia con alcuni preti ortodossi con i quali ci troviamo in incontri informali che hanno a tema leducazione di noi stessi e di chi incontriamo
8039138 tutta questa mia esperienza ha concluso il vescovo mi fa guardare con piet alle persone che incontro senza voler ingrossare le fila per me significa guardare con attenzione alla realt della russia e della sua chiesa ortodossa ricordandomi che tutti gli uomini compresi i russi sono bisognosi di cristo

8039366 myth cfcs are heavier than air so they cant reach the ozone layer
8039367 1 to relieve of a responsibility obligation or hardship 2 to clear from accusation or blame
8039368 turns out that while its true that cfcs are heavier than air so is water but if you actually bother looking for them youll discover that they both can be found quite high up in the atmosphere

8039379 someone told me that electric cars that are almost as powerful as petrol run cars have already been invented but didnt go into production coz if it did the fuel companies would suffer terrible losses wonder if its really true
8039380 nobody can claim to have all the answers to a specific question science has made us technological junkies and a lot of corporate scum only see the dollar sign at the end of tunnel what needs to be done is truthful marketing and labeling of products

8039392 scientists using federal grants spread fertilizer made from human and industrial wastes on yards in poor black neighborhoods to test whether it might protect children from lead poisoning in the soil families were assured the sludge was safe and were never told about any harmful ingredients
8039393 nine low income families in baltimore row houses agreed to let researchers till the sewage sludge into their yards and plant new grass in exchange they were given food coupons as well as the free lawns as part of a study published in 2005 and funded by the housing and urban development department the associated press reviewed grant documents obtained under the freedom of information act and interviewed researchers no one involved with the 446 231 grant for the two year study would identify the participants citing privacy concerns there is no evidence there was ever any medical follow up

8039435 bayers management has to be called to account since the risks have now been known for more than 10 years
8039436 we are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
8039437 i dont think this is the last word yet a lot depends on how far apart they actually are on an agreement on verification
8039438 it may well be that both things are going on at the same time
8039439 for the north koreans they dont have anything to lose from waiting
8039440 the deal has come undone and the north koreans are playing brinksmanship because they know the administration will blink or else itll run out of time its a no win situation
8039441 all that was agreed upon at the present phase was to set up verification and monitoring mechanisms
8039442 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8039443 were not afraid of anything of the prospect of a cold war
8039444 of course we dont want that in this situation everything depends on the stand of the world community and our partners in the west
8039445 but if they choose a confrontational scenario we will be responsive
8039446 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8039447 of course this raises some questions because normally battleships do not deliver aid and if it is a battleship diplomacy or rather battleship humanitarian diplomacy of course it does not make the situation more stable
8039448 but this is the choice of those who deliver aid
8039449 this is like a bullfight in spain when someone sticks a knife in the bull and it is bleeding and people are waiting for the bull to die
8039450 each case of recognition is by its nature a separate case a special case in kosovo a special case in south ossetia and abkhazia
8039451 this super tough attitude angered russia and finally it kind of took the bit between its teeth and said all right if this is the way you make the world see it we shall go the way we want
8039452 this decision is fraught with serious consequences and primarily with a deepening crisis in russias relations with the west
8039453 the war with georgia dealt these relations a crucial blow but the kremlin does not care it is willing to demonstrate that it can afford to ignore western opinion
8039454 we have already seen the georgian army cannot resist the russian army and i dont see that any western countries are eager to send their forces here
8039455 its high time to understand whats happening in georgia is not about georgia its about the world order
8039456 i dont think we should really be afraid of isolation
8039457 we are in for a long period of mutual malevolence
8039458 were going to have to do some forensics these are very complicated systems
8039459 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all
8039460 candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver
8039461 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8039462 if we were to do 10 ballots id support her on every one
8039463 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person i just dont think he gets it i dont think he realizes what ordinary americans are going through but i do and thats why im running for president
8039464 i think its time for a change in our administration with the economy the housing mess
8039465 most people are just trying to make it and theyre not focused
8039466 women historically are the last group to make up their minds
8039467 hes had a rocky relationship with the partys conservative base
8039468 the republican party is the next guy in line party whoever he picks as vice president could become the next guy in line if he picks a mainstream conservative then the conservatives can get excited not just about the mccain candidacy but the future of the party
8039469 a week ago romney and pawlenty looked like the two most likely conservative choices but i think over the last several days events have conspired against both of them
8039470 ive got nothing for you on the vp question he will select a fine running mate i dont know who that will be
8039471 i think his aides floated the idea of lieberman to prove to mccain that it would get knocked down
8039472 rysslands agerande bara f rv rrar det sp nda l get och komplicerar diplomatiska f rhandlingar
8039473 they said the call last night was a mistake that they had not ruled the staff had decided to sleep on it the apology was sincere
8039474 i guess i made a mistake in cutting a joke
8039475 julio you know what i actually ran into julio in the spring recruiting
8039476 i said hello to him and said i guess ill be seeing you at the end of august then he got out and got in his escalade and drove off thats serious
8039477 and then i went over and watched alabama freshman burton scott at vigor high school at the track over there
8039478 and burton scott was running around he went and got in his escalade out at track practice and drove off so im familiar with those two guys
8039479 he couldnt figure out why i would say something like that
8039480 i said well i was joking around at the end of practice yesterday and it just got taken the wrong way so it was my mistake for even joking around in that environment
8039481 a guy makes an off the cuff comment and i know were really looking for things to write about and talk about on the internet and on talk shows
8039482 if we wouldve had some bad blood in the past but heres a school that weve had zero bad blood
8039483 that shows you how insignificant i think the statement is
8039484 thats not me to cast stones or to have ill feelings toward that
8039485 it was my misjudgement in saying something in a joking manner that got taken and run with
8039486 hes nervous because hes the kind of guy that wants everyone to be pleased with his performance starting with himself hes a perfectionist
8039487 but i think when it comes down to the concepts that our people have asked him to understand the true xs and os that people have asked him to understand i think hes done an excellent job
8039488 a tremendous athlete someone whos willing to learn hes humble now
8039489 we had to show him a little bit that this is a different level and everybody starts from the bottom
8039490 i usually challenged him and talked junk he got mad a few times
8039491 i wouldnt hit him the way to test somebodys humbleness or where they are mentally is to challenge them verbally to see how they can handle people coming at them and how they handle pressure in a game a lot of guys talk junk you have to be able to just take it in stride and keep your cool at first he had a little trouble with it but hes fine now
8039492 the seniors must get after him pretty good because every once in a while ill get a text from him saying are we supposed to get up at 5 30 or is this another senior prank on me
8039493 i walked by the meeting room and terrelle was in there watching film this morning and i asked him if he was nervous
8039494 he just had that big smile and was trying to act like he wasnt going to be but hell be nervous
8039495 a little bit of the virginia story where we actually got democrats and republicans to work together
8039496 an awful lot of america has been forgotten by both parties the last 30 years small town america
8039497 we are delighted to be in the draw for the next round and we hope to mount another good cup run
8039498 we knew cowdenbeath would battle for every ball and that they did throughout the game but we were up for it and we controlled the vast majority of possession
8039499 our two first half goals settled the tie and then we played some great stuff in the second half
8039500 it was great to see jon daly get a hat trick but the finishing of both strikers was first class
8039501 we did well in the early part of the game and posed them a problem or two at times but the longer it went on the more difficult it got for us and in the end we were well beaten although some of dundee uniteds finishing was lethal
8039502 we now want to put that into action in our forthcoming fixtures
8039503 on iran joe biden has been wrong he has pursued a policy of engagement with a terrorist sponsoring regime
8039504 when he came back my father was a mentor for him
8039505 we will focus on results on good ideas that dont have a d or an r beside them
8039506 if they wanted a slash and burn contrasting speaker thats not me
8039507 im not going to say one thing in richmond or in danville and another thing at the democratic convention in denver
8039508 im asking virginians to give senator obama a chance let him make his case
8039509 this man will bring in policies at the national level that weve tried to do
8039510 this is not going to be the year that we make big changes
8039511 inclusive candidate who understands that our party needs to reach out to all americans to win this election
8039512 this was an endlessly fascinating process already and its still got some twists and turns between now and november
8039513 but underneath that and in the background there is also a different story which we dont want to unearth much on the convention floor because its not really what were trying to do but which you should be mindful of
8039514 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8039515 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8039516 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out
8039517 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
8039518 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8039519 i know this is not coming from barack obama but his supporters are helping us decide who to vote for
8039520 i hate the feeling that you shouldnt wear your hillary gear unless there are two or three of you together
8039521 i cant imagine not going into a convention and hearing alabama and the whole world looking up to see what comes next
8039522 but as typical of these roll calls at a certain point somebody has the votes and the protocol and graciousness come through and that will have its own dynamic
8039523 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
8039524 so let there be the no mistake about it we are united we are united for change
8039525 people like fights but thats not what im seeing here
8039526 i was elected as a hillary delegate so whatever she says
8039527 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
8039528 a great american story modest means but big dreams and encouragement from loving parents
8039529 instead of asking for candy were going to go out and ask people to vote
8039530 this is a unifying effort coming out of here dont you go telling anyone anything different
8039531 weve been working really hard against the im just going to stay home or the the countrys not ready for an african american president
8039532 they were like thats going to do it for me
8039533 we know that the racial factor is a component for some union members
8039534 trump any kind of hesitation they have about the color of his skin
8039535 the retirement sector simply because of the way they grew up they are the ones who will have to look at the issues
8039536 the economys in shambles and i think people are going to vote more on their pocketbook than maybe they have been
8039537 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight
8039538 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause
8039539 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8039540 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
8039541 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
8039542 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8039543 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8039544 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8039545 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
8039546 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8039547 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
8039548 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
8039549 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
8039550 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8039551 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
8039552 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
8039553 estamos de fato agregando valor ao nosso neg cio e ao de nossos parceiros
8039554 i think people are looking for whos going to fight for them in the white house
8039555 and if they have confidence that im going to make their lives better their childrens lives better i dont think they care whether im green blue or polka dot
8039556 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8039557 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
8039558 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
8039559 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
8039560 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8039561 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
8039562 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8039563 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
8039564 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
8039565 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8039566 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8039567 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
8039568 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
8039569 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
8039570 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
8039571 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8039572 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
8039573 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
8039574 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
8039575 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
8039576 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
8039577 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8039578 virginia should feel complimented that three virginia democrats were being considered
8039579 obama and kaine have similar philosophies on economic and human rights issues
8039580 i would have loved to see tim kaine on the ticket
8039581 for us to share an asset like tim kaine would have been great
8039582 could i just mention to you jay that in a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
8039583 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
8039584 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
8039585 every one of us could stand up and recite all the reasons why we must elect barack
8039586 so let there be the no mistake about it we are united we are united for change
8039587 now i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8039588 it may unite our party against the outsider what he said was the truth but it may unite us against him
8039589 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
8039590 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
8039591 if they wanted a slash and burn contrasting speaker thats not me
8039592 im not going to say one thing in richmond or in danville and another thing at the democratic convention in denver
8039593 im asking virginians to give senator obama a chance let him make his case
8039594 this man will bring in policies at the national level that weve tried to do
8039595 we have a great ability here to adjust the electorate
8039596 im 72 and i thought id see the first woman president before i die
8039597 i want it on my tombstone that i supported hillary clinton
8039598 i will never leave her in spirit and mind but i am going to work to make virginia blue
8039599 just to not walk that fine line again we have to move forward we dont have much time here and we have to unify the party and strengthen the party unity
8039600 i think theres some work to do not to say these obstacles are insurmountable
8039601 is critical because shes done extraordinary work in her public life and she deserves such an honor
8039602 doesnt magnify any problems it just honors her public service
8039603 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
8039604 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
8039605 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
8039606 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
8039607 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
8039608 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
8039609 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
8039610 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
8039611 obamas major challenge at this convention is to focus on the middle class to show empathy because he had to climb his way up
8039612 proud arizonan she wants to preserve one of the states great traditions
8039613 arizonans are rightly proud of our state the democratic governor said on the podium of the democratic national convention
8039614 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt she said
8039615 theres a pattern here barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president he lost bruce babbitt ran for president and he lost
8039616 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8039617 something positive here about here fellow arizonan sen john mccain the republican partys candidate for president
8039618 well we needed to get the word out about keokuk that were open for business 365 days a year we thought billboards would give us an opportunity
8039619 this is a classic case where both sides are right
8039620 essentially since 12b 1 fees have evolved as a substitute for sales loads funds charge these fees to recoup the cost of prior sales even if they are now closed to new assets
8039621 once you make it prescriptive there are ways around it
8039622 the fact that a manager is closing a fund does show a sense of responsibility towards investors
8039623 you know joe biden is an impenetrable thicket of words romney replied in an interview on cnns
8039624 i cant imagine anybody is ready to debate joe biden
8039625 senator biden seems to be an impenetrable thicket of words so i cant imagine having to go up against him i think that almost anybody that goes up against him would find themselves outspoken
8039626 but i dont have anything for you the vp front romney told both cavuto and cnns wolf blitzer
8039627 im not sure when john mccain will make his announcement and who it will be but i have confidence in his instincts hes proven time and time again that those instincts serve him well and i think hell make a wise choice
8039628 out of the mainstream at least in my view of conservative republican thoughts
8039629 well i think that the mccain campaign would be happy if they played that ad with my comments because it just points out something that well i think everybody in america knows and that is that john mccain is his own man that hes not a carbon copy of any other republican including president bush romney said in response to the clips
8039630 and this whole line of attack that hes a continuation of bush just isnt going to fly
8039631 you know in a debate we talk about why were the right person to win and the other guy isnt romney said
8039632 but one thing i never said about john mccain so far as i can recall i never said he wasnt qualified
8039633 you know i really dont think i want to do this can i please leave now
8039634 see she slept through the entire procedure and shes still asleep
8039635 take your bend your leg and dont raise your head
8039636 dont raise your head it puts pressure on the artery
8039637 it was really that it was cloudy but its clear now so thats fine
8039638 should i call my friend to pick me up it will take him at least an hour to get here
8039639 you dont have to leave and i dont think your pain is managed yet
8039640 youd better take the basin with you just in case
8039641 you do what you have to do in the moment thats best for your family but either way you hurt someone you care about
8039642 i felt like i was being torn between a mother figure and a brother figure
8039643 two members of the family one who i felt like i owed something to but the other who was kind of really appealing in a different way
8039644 it was the most stressed ive been in my life
8039645 at that point the only way i could see her getting a majority is a way that would tear the party apart and i didnt want to be a part of that
8039646 its like a coming of age where you close the door on one chapter and you open it on another
8039647 i was closing the door on sort of what politics was about when i first got involved and who were the key players and who were the role models and who got me in the door and moving more toward whats the future and thats just never an easy transition for anybody
8039648 but the fact that i was personally involved in it made it even harder
8039649 the eastern shore part of virginia and delaware are very very similar
8039650 i think theres a lot in common and joe understands that
8039651 hes a great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level and virginians like that
8039652 election night could well come down to virginia and colorado
8039653 more than likely if barack obama can win just one of them hell get the keys to the white house
8039654 based on a technique developed at uc irvine called trace trees
8039655 a few of us have spent the last two months and most of the last few nights teaching spidermonkey some exciting new tricks
8039656 tracing follows only the hot paths and builds a trace tree cache
8039657 another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
8039658 even with this very very early version were already seeing some promising results
8039659 there are many wins left in each one of those benchmarks and well be working on those through firefox 3 1 and beyond
8039660 but were charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1
8039661 we have right now x86 x86 64 and arm support in tracemonkey
8039662 this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
8039663 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
8039664 hey seniors sleep through your first class of senior year joke about hott freshmen boys with the other first year girls in your classes make out with said freshmen wear string bikinis to frat parties drink too much on the weekdays make friends with your profs draw too much attention to yourself dont shower if youre doing thesis work its like a badge of honor act like youre over albions high school bullshit because lets admit it you really are throw wicked sweet house parties barbecue every friday realize how much youve grown as an academic and as a person when listening to younger brits talk in class wear yoga pants religiously try something other than pbr or bells theres more to life we promise engage in thoughtful debate even though youve taken upper level classes and you know youre right start worshipping the quad god so you can graduate in style come may invest in memories and your future simultaneously work hard party hard pull a miss j
8039665 its an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
8039666 we didnt hear anything about her being consulted they treat her as if shes a black sheep
8039667 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
8039668 que sepa el destino que sos vos el que decid s cuando
8039669 vas a ir al banco el mi rcoles pr ximo y vas a calentar al comienzo del 2 tiempo para entrar cuando falten 30 o 20 minutos

8039679 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations
8039680 it is vital that the international and afghan military forces thoroughly review the conduct of this operation in order to prevent a repeat of this tragic incident
8039681 foreign and afghan military personnel entered the village of nawabad in the azizabad area of shindand district
8039682 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
8039683 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8039684 according to the villagers their enemies give false report to americans that foreign fighters were gathering in the village
8039685 i cant blame the afghan national army for the incident as they had no authority for leading the operation
8039686 we got people in we got people out we didnt ask any questions
8039687 every plan we hatched was to make sure we didnt get caught thankfully we did not
8039688 it was a time concern and a privacy concern we didnt want anything to get lost
8039689 oh barack was meeting with evan bayh today that actually was so far from the truth it was easy to get to someone else
8039690 ive had more contact from the mccain campaign since the nomination than from the obama campaign
8039691 i still firmly believe there is a tremendous amount of untapped resources that can be tapped if the obama campaign pro actively engages people in the clinton world
8039692 senator clintons speech and president clintons speech wednesday will be significant statements about the future of the democratic party and the importance of the election of barack obama
8039693 barack obama as well meaning as he is is simply wrong on all the major issues
8039694 as the republicans whine outside in their pathetic display of support for the bush mccain agenda our historic convention is moving along full steam ahead
8039695 it shall be an offence to deliberately mislead through advertising in relation to the termination of pregnancy and alternatives thereto
8039696 any person association or body corporate shall be guilty of an offence
8039697 material which contains false information and is untruthful or in its overall presentation deceives or is in any way likely to deceive the average person even if the information is factually correct
8039698 causes or is likely to cause the average pregnant woman to take a decision in relation to the termination of her pregnancy she would not have taken otherwise
8039699 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
8039700 we realize that mistakes have been made but were excited in florida
8039701 michigan had the guts to take the system on and we made progress this year
8039702 you see the candidates coming to michigan talking about the issues talking about manufacturing and we think we need a nominating process that gives every state that chance to talk about the issues
8039703 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
8039704 running a hedge fund is harder than it looks on tv
8039705 the eastern shore part of virginia and delaware are very very similar
8039706 i think theres a lot in common and joe understands that
8039707 www lds org gospel library gospel topics holy ghost additional information
8039708 better than expected we thought during 1st couple of weeks we would have some confusion
8039709 oh absolutely kids know eash other really well and of course winning a state championship doesnt hurt for kids to get to know each other
8039710 its not too hard you get to meet a lot of new people also more educational classes are available now
8039711 its okay it wasnt as hard as i thought it would be most of my classes are in two sections because i am taking college classes so i will get a head start in life
8039712 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
8039713 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8039714 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
8039715 he was able to make the medicare vote and that was the vote that turned the bill around
8039716 the convention would be a nice thing for him to show up at
8039717 its certainly one hed like to do if he could but the medicare vote was a must do this is not a have to
8039718 that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8039719 picks up where obama is lacking we think it is a good choice for obama
8039720 i havent seen kaine on the national stage very often like i did biden
8039721 i dont think kaine casts a wide enough net to get the support of the country i think biden is more recognizable
8039722 i definitely was on joe bidens side the whole time
8039723 he has extensive foreign policy experience hes a great debater hes smart he knows how to work in the senate which is going to be an important thing
8039724 he was my pick i dont think kaine should be disappointed tim kaine can do great things for virginia and he didnt have any of the things to make obama complete
8039725 i dont know if it will help obama a lot since he will win delaware anyway
8039726 if this is what obama feels the country needs then i agree with him and i think hes wise enough to make a good choice
8039727 senator biden has some foreign policy experience and i think that is an advantage governor kaine has some budgetary responsibilities here that i think should be addressed i think he has a job to do in virginia
8039728 i just think they would have been better overall candidates
8039729 the rapid increase in foreclosures this year has led many lenders to consider loan modification as a method of loss mitigation
8039730 our goal for the website is to help connect homeowners facing foreclosure with foreclosure prevention specialists since many homeowners are not aware of loan modification or how to start the process
8039731 for decades he brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8039732 the economy the mortgage crisis gas prices and of course world affairs
8039733 we started this campaign with a simple belief that the american people are better than their government in washington
8039734 we cannot afford four more years of the same politics four more years of the same policies
8039735 there is something about this guy there is something about barack obama that allows him to bring people together
8039736 this is no ordinary time this is no ordinary election this may be the last time to restore americas soul
8039737 to put your feet in the right place and stand firm
8039738 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
8039739 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
8039740 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
8039741 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
8039742 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
8039743 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
8039744 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
8039745 i dont think its fair to lump all celebrities together
8039746 most serious celebrities dont pretend to be anything more than activists and good citizens why should ben affleck be penalized just because hes an actor and a director hes smarter more articulate better read on foreign policy that 98 percent of us
8039747 why shouldnt he be in denver he has nothing to be ashamed of
8039748 it depends on the celebrity whether it hurts or helps
8039749 i dont think oprah hurts i think she helps a lot
8039750 i am very excited that senator obama has selected senator biden to be his running mate
8039751 the obama biden ticket provides the united states with a new and meaningful dialogue with world leaders and will improve americas standing with our allies and the global community
8039752 as a governor i know the value of having reliable partners who are willing to tackle tough challenges in washington
8039753 mamma che cretina a fare sto intervento chi vuoi che lo legga dai per le visite ce lho quindi a qualcuno la mia vita interessa ahahah che cazzate che sparo a volte solo pensare alla mia vita mi sembra strano dagli stronzi che odiavo a me stessa che mi sento una stronza globale e ora che mi invento beh dai come si dice in questi casi nessuno perfetto e nemmeno chi penso io lo ma forse proprio perch si imperfetti che si piace bella questa che poeta che so beh pu darsi come mi ha detto una persona alla fine la perfezione viene a noia meglio vivere nel caos e io ne so qualcosa visto che la mia stanza sembra un campo minato di vestiti oddio devo trovare quella borsa quanto era bella mamma a quella ragazza glielavrei scippata sarei stilosa con quella specie di tracolla figa vuoto oddio bella la canzone twist and shout a qualcuno dovrebbe far venire una serata passata in macchina dove lui faceva la prima voce e io il coro belli quei ricordi i migliori ma ora basta pensare a lui e di conseguenza scrivere di lui senn facevo un intervento su di lui e festa finita che figo quel citto per il corso ca o ma non potevo pensare ad altro ecco ora tutti sapranno che ho visto un figo allucinogeno per il corso grrrr che testa uffa e ora che scrivo sono a corto di idee alla fine mi sputtano per bene dai sputtaniamoci per bene in questo intervento scrivo quel che penso ragazzi statemi alla larga sono lincertezza fatta in persona ecco fatto che cavolo mi preso si ma non possibile che mi torna sempre qui lui forse perch ci ho appena parlato fra relax ormai hai chiuso e te non provi pi niente anche perch i maschi per ora li stai trattando veramente malissimo e checca mi dispiace ma non si fa nonono mah sar anche per via dei debiti oddio lho passato uno quello di tecnica wowowowowowowowo che figata grande riccia anche nei momenti di panico mi hai fatto ridere
8039754 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
8039755 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
8039756 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
8039757 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
8039758 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
8039759 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
8039760 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
8039761 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
8039762 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
8039763 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
8039764 the some were from the places that have a stereotype about fox but when i asked them if they ever actually watched fox the answer is almost never
8039765 my sense is that there is a recognition that we cant ignore or give the back of our hand to the largest audience in cable television news
8039766 they have nothing to do with a progressive point of view
8039767 i dont think you would find anybody in the progressive movement who would say yes they are spokesmen for what we believe in
8039768 is a disaster at standing up for democrats that must be why fox hired him
8039769 without liberals and progressives to yell at without liberal positions to make fun of fox doesnt exist
8039770 people who know me know that im not a shrinking violet
8039771 i didnt sign up to be the guy who plays the harlem globetrotters
8039772 you can walk into a room where everybody agrees with you give a talk and everyone applauds you so you leave the room thinking youve accomplished something or you can go into a room filled with people who either havent made their minds up or disagree with you and try to open some minds
8039773 being on fox is like going into the second room
8039774 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
8039775 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
8039776 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8039777 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8039778 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8039779 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
8039780 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
8039781 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
8039782 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8039783 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
8039784 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
8039785 when any position is fixed i am sure the campaign and the convention folks will release it
8039786 i dont think there is any question that virginia is in play
8039787 they are making an all out full court effort in virginia
8039788 i have no delusions that this is an easy task but virginia is doable
8039789 i dont think the democrats euphoria is enough to overcome the fact that obama is wrong for virginia
8039790 habr algun negocio multinivel en internet que me de m s libertad de tiempo
8039791 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
8039792 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
8039793 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
8039794 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
8039795 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
8039796 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
8039797 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
8039798 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
8039799 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
8039800 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8039801 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
8039802 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
8039803 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
8039804 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down

8039807 a severely food allergic consumer would probably want to contact a restaurant well ahead of the time that they plan to dine out it would be important to talk to the chef who is involved in meal preparations the owner or the manager
8039808 i think each and every member state is very clear that it is of the utmost importance to find a common position and i am going to do whatever i can so that we succeed
8039809 the russian federations actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation the nation of georgia
8039810 this a challenge to the entire world not just georgia
8039811 the point here is the russians are bluffing and theyre overplaying their hand
8039812 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
8039813 the ball is in the europeans court if they want a worsening in relations they will get it of course
8039814 if they want to maintain strategic relations which is in my opinion totally in the interests of russia and europe everything will go well
8039815 we will always abide by the decision of the committee we will need the support of the leadership otherwise we will not be able to implement it
8039816 look what has happened to our country today we will be opening ourselves to questions at this point in time we have not heard our constituents
8039817 if we remember there were massive protests in 2006 the house shelved the charter change proposals precisely because of the massive protest from the people its now 2008 has the sentiments of the people changed we should consult the people
8039818 is it the right time to discuss charter change if we take on the issue of charter change it will really add to the stress and tension of muslims in mindanao
8039819 as a career focused art and film school we encourage our instructors to remain professionally active in the areas they teach with the expansion of our new film facility 14th street studio our instructors and students have more opportunities to participate in career related projects outside of school we are also proud of the fact that the film was entirely shot in arizona with local talent and film crews

8039824 the index results show a significant shift in consumer behavior especially among female consumers

8039832 as a couple with two young children we were becoming increasingly concerned about our impact on the environment and we started to look actively at how we could reduce our own carbon footprint like many families up and down the country we realised there are no easy answers and you cant suddenly become green overnight the philosophy we adopted was to think big and act small both my wife and i work in an office environment and we noticed that we are always using search engines and thats where the idea for click4carbon came from
8039833 the principle behind click4carbon is to offer users one simple means of reducing their footprint through an everyday activity that they already do we are not trying to reinvent the wheel google is by far the most popular search engine in the world all that we want to do is provide users with that same experience but with a different goal in mind click4carbon is our way of trying to make a difference
8039834 the ponente just gives a copy of the decision to the other members of the division if they agree with the decision they just sign the ponencia
8039835 it will be the first time that i will see that transcript
8039836 justice roxas said it is a transcript then he said that it was only a summary of the points you talked about on july 14 then you say that it is only an impression of your meeting which is which
8039837 they were only changing the date because he wanted to cover his reyess tracks
8039838 i still dont know how its going to feel swinging
8039839 im being a little tentative to do so im going to give it a couple more days its definitely taken some good steps forward in the past week a lot less pain in the last week
8039840 they are going to reveal what they want to reveal when they want to reveal it
8039841 ive always thought it sounded a bit unlikely but im not going to tell you it hasnt been flattering
8039842 i havent because i dont know how but my son has
8039843 how obamas new brand of politics play in states previously left for dead by the democratic party
8039844 2008 is the first year when production has reached the level prior to that of saddam husseins fall
8039845 daura refineries resumed producing gasoline after repairing a technical malfunction that occurred days ago
8039846 on monday moo supplied 6 450 million litters of gasoline to gas stations
8039847 the oil companies want more war against iran will mean 10 a gallon gasoline the oil administration wants to drill more into your wallet wake up america weapons contractors want more an iran war will cost 5 to 10 trillion dollars
8039848 i recently challenged my colleagues to step up to the plate and help me provide the resources our candidates need to compete in races across the country
8039849 it has become clear that my call has gone largely unanswered
8039850 i have had no choice but to decrease the total budget
8039851 its extremely difficult because failure breeds failure and contributors are less likely to spend money on a losing cause
8039852 republicans just need to adapt to the conditions in each individual state because if this election is a referendum on the state of the country then theyre going to do very badly
8039853 from the type of symptoms we are seeing their duration the underlying age and health status of the individuals we really dont believe that this is listeriosis
8039854 its not unusual during the summer to see clusters of gastrointestinal illness in a summer camp setting
8039855 our overall advice to candidates has been to stay home
8039856 not to separate themselves from the democratic party but because thats where their constituents are you dont find your constituents in denver and these are important days
8039857 thats what this election is all about are the american people going to be sure they have someone in the white house who is fighting for them
8039858 a man who will bring about change at a time our nation needs it
8039859 the nice thing is that were doing events in the home stretch in virginia
8039860 we need somebody of excellence we need somebody whos a unifier
8039861 was mayor of the 105th largest city in america its not a big town
8039862 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8039863 herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8039864 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8039865 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8039866 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
8039867 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
8039868 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
8039869 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
8039870 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
8039871 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it
8039872 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
8039873 but seriously i dont think you can i dont think seriously that the point is that im trying to make here seriously and im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
8039874 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
8039875 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8039876 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
8039877 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8039878 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8039879 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8039880 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
8039881 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8039882 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
8039883 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
8039884 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
8039885 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
8039886 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
8039887 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programs to encourage and support behaviour change
8039888 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
8039889 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
8039890 this is the first massive effort in the political world
8039891 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
8039892 all this coaxing this being coy and planning to the nth degree is going to invite the most detailed critical scrutiny that youve ever seen
8039893 in spite of the fact that the rumored choices are all wonderful people none of them is jesus and none of them is moses even their friends can point out shortcomings
8039894 so this is going to be something that most people havent seen in their lifetime
8039895 if you let expectations get out of control and you cant satisfy them youve got yourself into a big hole
8039896 i think that race is always a factor in the minds of some people but i think thats the tiny minority here in virginia and around the country
8039897 i think that people are looking for whos going to fight for them in the white house
8039898 and if they have confidence that im going to make their lives better their childrens lives better i dont think they care whether im green or blue or polka dot
8039899 nobodys going to take the guns of law abiding virginians away from them
8039900 we need to do things to reduce the numbers of abortions through support for adoption and support for mothers and providing education and various strategies to reduce unwanted pregnancies
8039901 the fact that were tied i think that sends a good signal about what were doing
8039902 this is a state in transition obviously the success of former gov mark warner and tim kaine and sen jim webb indicate that democrats can win statewide but its going to require everything weve got in order to pull this out
8039903 hes one of my earliest supporters he was my earliest gubernatorial endorser outside of my home state and he is a great friend of mine
8039904 i havent because i dont know how but my son has
8039905 youre just going to have to hear from the campaign
8039906 theyll make the announcement when theyre ready ill just call that taking the fifth or something theyll let us know when they want to
8039907 for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country
8039908 all this coaxing this being coy and planning to the nth degree is going to invite the most detailed critical scrutiny that youve ever seen
8039909 in spite of the fact that the rumored choices are all wonderful people none of them is jesus and none of them is moses even their friends can point out shortcomings
