4390000 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4390001 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4390002 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4390003 our 14 offices are part of a highly structured volunteer heavy plan to win in new hampshire
4390004 we are creating neighborhood teams with volunteers who are trained equipped and empowered to build a campaign organization in their own neighborhood
4390005 i think weve built on that grass roots effort from 2004
4390006 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4390007 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
4390008 because in math and organic chemistry you find truths someone cannot say 2 2 5 or that a carbon molecule no longer has a molecular weight of 12
4390009 unfriendly ghosts from your past may never disappear entirely they can return to haunt you at a moments notice the key is to keep meeting these apparitions head on
4390010 the harder we try to keep bad memories out of conscious recall the more powerful they become since they are not allowed to enter through the door of our minds directly they come into our personalities body mind and spirit in disguised and destructive ways
4390011 we can alter our lives by altering our attitudes of mind
4390012 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4390013 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges

4390015 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together

4390017 republican presidential candidate john mccain now enjoys a healthy 88 7 percent lead over barack obama among republicans
4390018 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4390019 m ost of america understands that the competence bar is set so low for gov george w bush of texas that its practically lying on the ground
4390020 doesnt seem to realize that in the real world people hate eddie haskell
4390021 for every complex problem there is a solution that is simple neat and wrong
4390022 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4390023 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4390024 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4390025 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
4390026 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
4390027 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
4390028 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4390029 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4390030 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4390031 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4390032 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4390033 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4390034 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4390035 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4390036 considering what the current neo con president has actually succeeded in doing to the balance of power between the branches which far supasses fdrs now feeble looking attempts
4390037 bush has gotten away with dispicable acts that any civilized democracy should not tolerate
4390038 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4390039 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4390040 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4390041 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4390042 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4390043 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4390044 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4390045 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4390046 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4390047 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4390048 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4390049 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4390050 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4390051 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4390052 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4390053 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4390054 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4390055 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4390056 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4390057 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4390058 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4390059 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4390060 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4390061 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4390062 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4390063 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4390064 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4390065 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4390066 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4390067 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4390068 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4390069 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4390070 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4390071 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4390072 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4390073 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4390074 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4390075 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4390076 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4390077 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4390078 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4390079 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4390080 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4390081 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4390082 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4390083 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4390084 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4390085 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4390086 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4390087 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4390088 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4390089 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4390090 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4390091 i leave for egypt on the 11th and arrive in cairo on september 12 if i go on the 14th i will miss two days
4390092 our grass bushes and trees are lush green really a coolish august almost autumn like weather temps
4390093 just finished a short bio of doc holliday he had a short life love those wild west portraits those were the days
4390094 people are being asked to put in more hours in the office and that is clearly starting to take its toll employers who ignore the happiness of their workers leave themselves open to a mass exodus as soon as the economy picks up
4390095 we are not against the sale of gt but we believe ghana is being cheated in the whole process vodafones offer is too small to warrant what they are getting we dont know why higher bidders like telecom south africa were rather sidelined
4390096 we are aware of the political implications of everything mr speaker let us move forward ghana has got one of the best deals mr speaker we are moving forward there is no better offer
4390097 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4390098 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4390099 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4390100 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4390101 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4390102 just so you all know we did set a record
4390103 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4390104 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4390105 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4390106 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4390107 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4390108 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4390109 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4390110 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4390111 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4390112 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4390113 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4390114 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4390115 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4390116 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4390117 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4390118 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4390119 for climate changes he glosses over that this local planetary system is in constant change and we cant accurately measure the recent relatively small changes and anthropogenic contributions are an open question
4390120 how would the developers in this audience feel if the news media were opining on the benefits of one programming language over another and other people with no knowledge of programming were making strong statements based on what theyd read or heard in the media
4390121 im curious robert whether you are also skeptical about evolution that would be a good litmus test of whether this is a political religious disagreement or a scientific one
4390122 right now your choices are between the scientists who are actually conducting the research and analysis and pundits who are opining on something that they have no data research or proper science to support
4390123 most scientists think that global warming is an issue i think its bunk
4390124 there no agreement among scientists that weather patterns are changing as a result of human activity
4390125 look they are saying there may be the equivalent of war crimes trials one day
4390126 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4390127 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4390128 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4390129 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4390130 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4390131 von denen man nicht will dass sie ein sechsj hriges kind h rt
4390132 sunday was such an important day for them so we added that back
4390133 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4390134 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4390135 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4390136 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4390137 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
4390138 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
4390139 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4390140 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4390141 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4390142 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
4390143 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
4390144 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
4390145 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4390146 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4390147 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4390148 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4390149 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4390150 we have begun the recruitment process for the smarter travel richmond team one of the first priorities for the team is to focus on research and strategy development
4390151 we expect that the programme will be launched jointly with tfl next spring with a range of initiatives designed to increase travel awareness and influence travel behaviour
4390152 the role of the programme manager is being temporarily covered by an existing senior member of staff until the position is filled
4390153 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4390154 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4390155 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4390156 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4390157 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4390158 we are confident the performance of our athletes in the olympic games will serve as a catalyst for our sport as we continue the summer long avp crocs tour
4390159 we look forward with great anticipation to our flagship event the historic manhattan beach open in september and also to the second year of the hot winter nights tour
4390160 vladimir poutine avait pilot pendant ses ann es au kremlin une rude mise au pas des oligarques et une concentration des grands groupes gazier et p trolier russes ils sont d sormais en ordre de bataille et servent une politique ext rieure de retour la puissance les premi res r actions diplomatiques la guerre avec la g orgie illustrent l parpillement europ en il ne faut pas d sesp rer moscou semble t on signifier

4390162 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4390163 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4390164 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4390165 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4390166 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4390167 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4390168 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4390169 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4390170 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4390171 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4390172 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4390173 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4390174 global warming is the greatest scam in history i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4390175 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4390176 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4390177 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4390178 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4390179 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4390180 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4390181 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4390182 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4390183 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4390184 a travers ces r cits s nonceront diff rentes chroniques du temps qui passe des corps qui se transforment tout ge in luctables choses de la vie
4390185 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4390186 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4390187 that will make the 40 40 club in vegas the largest sports booking operation people can gamble both at the tables and on games the sands will also have the right to open 40 40 clubs in london and across europe
4390188 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4390189 please use public transit bicycling or other climate friendly means
4390190 have to go back 15 years to find ice expansion so far south
4390191 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
4390192 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
4390193 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
4390194 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to
4390195 wir rechnen aber trotzdem f r 2009 noch mit leicht besseren zahlen als in diesem jahr
4390196 vor dem hintergrund der warnsignale aus der wirtschaft mit risiken verbunden
4390197 die zahlen beobachten wir genau sie sind aber f r den arbeitsmarkt im moment nicht entscheidend
4390198 russland hat gehandelt um auf eine aggression georgiens zu antworten
4390199 die usa sollten das nicht tun das macht die lage nur komplizierter
4390200 ist keine person der man vertrauen sollte aber es ist sache des georgischen volkes das zu entscheiden
4390201 and that leaves them more vulnerable to getting caught up in the strong ocean currents
4390202 aside from the oil in the campos basin the pollution is lowering the animals immunity leaving them vulnerable to funguses and bacteria that attack their lungs
4390203 it still amazes me that people actually watching me with a gun didnt just burst out laughing
4390204 this guy is treating our legal system like a revolving door and its time we closed the cell door on him
4390205 wait a minute doc ah are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean
4390206 the way i see it if youre going to build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style
4390207 gruffs really nuts about the life of john z delorean and the crazy history behind the man and his machine
4390208 were hoping to be able to offer gruff a ride round in one as well so if anyones got a mint delorean they want to show off then let us know

4390213 i had a gun with sticker darts and we were trying to shoot guavas and mangoes off peoples heads it started off as a bit of fun
4390214 before we knew what was happening there were 40 people involved there was a league system going it was amazing
4390215 it was an amazing pub which we all had some great and messy times in
4390216 theres no other places to have a good drink and a good laugh

4390218 it was so sociable everyone there was amazing and really fun it was somewhere you could sit back and meet people
4390219 we started going there because we made some friends who lived in camden every so often youd sit next to someone and get chatting and it would turn out that theyre a tv presenter
4390220 we wanted to top it off with winehouse but i dont think shes here
4390221 i wanted a lifestyle change and to incorporate my love of falconry into a business so when i saw nbc bird and pest solutions i thought it was perfect
4390222 an integration of a number of components from a variety of different sources
4390223 the demand side is a major concern supplies from opec countries are rising but there is a shortage of buyers the industrial use in
4390224 while still a dangerous transitional period the fact that diplomacy will now replace military action bodes well
4390225 i am satisfied that the history given by jatinder to the ambulance officers and to doctors of the consumption of 16 panadol tablets was not true
4390226 i also accept expert evidence that the amount consumed must have been well in excess of that disclosed
4390227 my wife was very friendly a good lady i still miss her

4390255 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4390256 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4390257 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4390258 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state left and right and these new regulations will make matters worse
4390259 rather than conforming our policies to questionable scientific theories we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse

4390261 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
4390262 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
4390263 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

4390265 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

4390296 i think the time is perfect for technocrats and particularly bits alumni to enter the field
4390297 not as employees but as founders and management who are the real decision makers and we can involve our friends and well wishers in these projects
4390298 somebody had to make the first move and start the first private engineering college where founders were bitsians
4390299 just imagine the collective impact of say 6 bits pilani campuses and 10 alumni founded colleges after 5 years without doubt this will help make bits pilani as probably the biggest brand for engineering education in india
4390300 we are working on a common structure guidelines and use of a common name which will also help strengthen bits pilani brand obviously these colleges will not use bits name and will be at locations where bits pilani does not plan to open a campus these colleges will take complementary role to bits pilani in all aspects and potential areas for collaboration and cooperation will be soon explored
4390301 and nuva is special because it is the first such college the team is gearing up for conquering next coimbatore and dehradun

4390307 that while the concept of industry academia partnership is picking up with tifacs mission reach initiative industry must realise that the primary role of academia is to encourage innovation our educational centres of excellence should be developed to create new applications rather than be seen as a low cost substitute to solve routine technical problems

4390318 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4390319 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4390320 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits
4390321 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
4390322 people who were highly anxious had raised wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
4390323 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
4390324 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
4390325 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
4390326 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress

4390346 el acuerdo es de dos partes y tambi n de diecisiete porque la propuesta tiene una parte bilateral y otra multilateral
4390347 lo que dice el estatut y lo que dice el texto es que tiene que haber un acuerdo en materia de financiaci n no que el gobierno tenga que hacer esto o lo otro el matiz es importante
4390348 el acuerdo es de dos partes y tambi n de diecisiete porque la propuesta tiene una parte bilateral y otra multilateral

4390354 est dispuesto a recuperar la iniciativa pol tica en el tratamiento del frenazo econ mico
4390355 mejor es tomar iniciativas que quedarse quieto mientras pasa el vendaval
4390356 es este sentido hay que aplaudir el traslado al terreno estrictamente econ mico de la vocaci n reformista de este gobierno pero las propuestas concretas recitadas ayer por el presidente zapatero provocan dudas
4390357 refleja una resistencia a reconocer que sus causas no son s lo ex genas
4390358 la situaci n exige menos agitaci n gestual a la que tanto recurre la oposici n y m s realismo
4390359 el mal es general pero la crisis tiene en espa a causas internas que no se atajaron a tiempo y caracter sticas singulares como el persistente diferencial de inflaci n y el elevad simo d ficit exterior efecto de la p rdida de competitividad las medidas anticrisis deben tener en cuenta esa singularidad y servir para estimular el cambio de modelo de crecimiento
4390360 felicitarse por el hecho de que alemania o francia tengan dificultades es escupir al cielo
4390361 el error al poner el acento en tratar de blindarse de las cr ticas antes que en encontrar verdaderas soluciones a los problemas
4390362 el gobierno ha vuelto a perder otra oportunidad y como gr ficamente se al ayer ciu su plan es en realidad una aspirina para un enfermo grave
4390363 no s lo fracas en su prop sito de transmitir confianza a los ciudadanos ante la crisis econ mica sino que aliment la controversia sobre el futuro modelo de financiaci n auton mica
4390364 es pertinente aunque de nuevo tard o porque la guerra ya se ha desatado
4390365 simular ahora contundencia para matizar con tecnicismos o rectificar los inadmisibles privilegios financieros que acept en su momento para catalu a genera tanta incredulidad como sus razonamientos para combatir la crisis con seriedad y eficacia
4390366 no ha agotado todo el margen de maniobra que tiene para sacar a espa a de la grave situaci n en que se encuentra y ser a bueno que lo hiciera
4390367 el gobierno podr a haber hecho mucho m s de lo que ha hecho el presidente zapatero no cerr ayer la puerta a nuevas medidas a qu espera pues para adoptarlas mejor ser a actuar antes de que la econom a pudiera entrar en recesi n no estamos en ella pero la rozamos
4390368 zapatero vuelve a vender optimismo para hacer frente a lo que denomina frenazo econ mico
4390369 el optimismo siempre es bueno pero no como receta a una situaci n que afecta a todos los ciudadanos
4390370 no les aporta ninguna soluci n sino que crispa m s sus nimos al comprobar que no se toman medidas eficaces contra la grave situaci n
4390371 esa apreciaci n reincide en un optimismo ret rico que se ha demostrado inoperante para contrarrestar la realidad de unas cifras cada vez m s deprimidas obviando que la extensi n de la crisis en nuestro entrono merma las capacidades para remontarla y soslayando tambi n la vulnerabilidad que aqueja a espa a por su dependencia energ tica el desmedido peso de un sector inmobiliario en franco declive y el aumento del desempleo m s pronunciado de la ue
4390372 criterios muy austeros lo cual se quiera o no reconocer repercute directamente en el volumen de dinero disponible para que lo gasten las distintas administraciones
4390373 y a n es menos de recibo poner en duda la utilidad de informar al congreso y debatir las dificultades de la negociaci n del modelo de financiaci n porque de la resoluci n del problema depende la estabilidad parlamentaria del gobierno
4390374 aunque es obvio que no se le pueden pedir responsabilidades pol ticas a quien no ejerce ning n cargo p blico no es menos cierto que el ex presidente tiene una deuda moral con su partido y con la sociedad balear si matas no da la cara ser la de rosa estar s la que acabe parando los golpes
4390375 el ex presidente matas abandon el barco al no lograr acuerdos que mantuvieran al pp en el poder ahora ha vuelto de vacaciones a mallorca y son muchos los que echan de menos que d la cara

4390384 there is lots of anger and fear in the local community and people fear that if this violence is not brought to an end eventually somebody will be killed

4390395 its almost been like a no hitter type streak or something

4390405 the theme this time is brightons infamous west pier it opened in the late nineteenth century and was the place for elegant promenading for the first half of the twentieth it was used as a set for many films including oh what a lovely war and brighton rock but fell into disuse and decay and was closed to the public in 1974

4390411 why i can recall with a tear in one rheumy eye when sfwa was a just a wild idea put forward by damon knight

4390425 continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans

4390428 im 73 and im not sure ill live long enough to see the memorial open
4390429 lots of older people who lost loved ones are simply not going to make it
4390430 we dont understand the cost overruns or the delays all we understand is theres a big expensive hole in the ground where a memorial should be
4390431 total sum and finality of our financial commitment to the project
4390432 if there are additional costs we would expect to work with the port authority which is managing the construction to minimize them and identify funding to cover them
4390433 i run my office like i want government run i cut costs where i can and return what i can

4390435 climate change threatens our security and our economy more than any political problem we have at home or abroad but unfortunately it is not considered as a priority by any of the political parties in lebanon
4390436 the absence of climate change on the priorities of all major political parties in lebanon demonstrates either the inability of these parties to manage the country or their indifference to the threats facing its the people
4390437 lebanese and arabs in general have a cultural tendency to not really care about large environmental issues and dont seem willing or prepared to deal with them that is what this is all about
4390438 influencing lebanese and arab society as a whole to take action
4390439 throughout our conversation he has been calm measured and disinclined to rubbish the supermarket chains
4390440 but my suggestion that big food industrial scale operators are the way ahead sends him whizzing off piste jabbing his finger at me he lets rip what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
4390441 bouncing in his chair the prince sets out his nightmare vision a world in which millions of small farmers are driven off their land by global conglomerates into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
4390442 very important to talk to them they respond i find
4390443 few of his claims are based on data from the real world while some of the agricultural and environmental problems he highlights are clearly genuine his explanations for them are long on bombast and short on evidence
4390444 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
4390445 hundreds of millions of consumers in the united states have been eating gm food for 12 years with no evidence of any health problems
4390446 gm crops have not contributed to the problem but they may help to offer a medium term solution scientists are working actively to develop new crop varieties that require less water and that grow in more saline soils using both transgenic and conventional breeding techniques

4390526 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events

4390528 infants accounted for only an estimated 6 3 per cent of ed visits
4390529 because japan was an isolated island for so long there is so much that is unique about our culture
4390530 i want japanese to be proud of our traditions to understand that something japanese can be just as fashionable as something from the west
4390531 you pick up an ipod and it emanates california cool just as bang amp olufsen products feel very scandinavian
4390532 what you see coming out of japan now are designs that will be loved because they have a feeling of japanese ness
4390533 for my parents generation cool meant something was from the west

4390538 operating a business in a manner that meets or exceeds the ethical legal commercial and public expectations that society has of business
4390539 companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis
4390540 the commitment of business to contribute to sustainable economic development working with employees their families the local community and society at large to improve their quality of life
4390541 the less power an individual firm has to influence the market in which it sells its products the more competitive the market is
4390542 our plan to win is designed to deepen our connection with customers by delivering great mcdonald experiences in every restaurant in every time this plan revolves around customer focused business drivers people products place price and promotion
4390543 management systems with the purpose of making a corporation capable of reacting quickly and competently to changes in its environment

4390546 we are working with the airlines to rectify this problem we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers
4390547 may not be serving well the interests of either airlines or passengers
4390548 apparent lack of responsiveness to the differing needs of its airline customers and hence passengers and the consequences for the levels quality scope location and timing of investment and levels and quality of service
4390549 you get the total package with the cadillac especially if you get the all wheel drive v 8 model that we had
4390550 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4390551 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4390552 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4390553 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4390554 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4390555 the bible teaches that since sin entered the world way back with the very first human beings we have lived in an imperfect broken planet and that causes hurricanes and tornadoes
4390556 the main push has been a firmer us dollar across the board as well as weaker commodities
4390557 the us is not out of the woods but seems to be improving compared to the rest of the world
4390558 thats why the sentiment towards the us dollar has changed
4390559 while i applaud nbc for rolling out its total audience measurement index tami its confusing some of the knuckleheads in the press who conclude from it that a greater percentage of people are watching online than actually are there are some who would conclude from those numbers that 92 of the viewing of events occurs on television but when you see the minutes for the actual streams which actually are very impressive numbers for the internet its more like 99 5 of the viewing of the summer games is coming from television
4390560 nous avons t mal conseill s au d part la personne avec qui nous faisions affaire nous faisait miroiter que le joueur de hockey martin brodeur souhaitait investir dans notre projet alors quil nen tait rien
4390561 on pr voit r investir les b n fices des premi res ann es mais si tout roule bien il y aura rapidement un partage des profits
4390562 evidemment je ne suis pas daccord car cette mesure est une mesure qui une fois de plus ne r gle rien long terme
4390563 on va essayer de ne pas r percuter cette mesure dans nos tarifs cette ann e
4390564 je ne veux pas prendre dengagement pour les ann es qui viennent
4390565 so whaddaya think i say saakashvili is going to restore the territorial integrity of georgia five minutes before the opening ceremony starts in beijing and dare the russians to invade while the games are on
4390566 i said nothing about the possible russian response but if you had asked me i would say that moscow could not have taken it lying down
4390567 certainly the next white house will not be as supportive of saakashvili as this one and so if saakashvili wanted to reunite georgia he really had to do it this year and he was probably hoping the olympic games gave him the right cover
4390568 there is a presidential decree and it will naturally be implemented
4390569 i guarantee that we will do everything to ensure the presidents decree is carried out
4390570 we have one general commander for the black sea fleet it is the president of russia
4390571 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
4390572 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
4390573 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
4390574 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
4390575 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
4390576 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
4390577 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
4390578 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
4390579 we came to fight since our old neighbor russia thinks that it can fight us
4390580 this country thinks that old times will come back but that time is over everyone knows that the next one could be ukraine then poland
4390581 democratic market ways is ultimately a better way than authoritarian
4390582 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
4390583 president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission
4390584 must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
4390585 the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
4390586 will now need to review the full range of our relations
4390587 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4390588 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4390589 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4390590 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4390591 a poster child of the extremist elitist gun control movement
4390592 i led in the abramoff hearings in the in the obscure indian affairs committee for which people are still testifying and going to jail
4390593 i can prove it with the international organisations already bringing testimony to what im saying
4390594 if tomorrow mr saakashvili signs the document that we have negotiated with russian president mr medvedev then the withdrawal of russian troops can begin
4390595 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4390596 this is going to be a defining crisis in the united states russian relationship the danger is that neither side feels it can back down
4390597 we may only be at the beginning of this crisis rather than at the end of it
4390598 we have no idea what they are doing there why such a heavy force
4390599 one explanation could be that they are just trying to battle the civilian population
4390600 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago
4390601 lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians
4390602 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
4390603 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
4390604 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
4390605 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
4390606 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
4390607 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
4390608 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
4390609 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
4390610 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
4390611 diab te le cholest rol lhypertension mais aussi linsuffisance cardiaque

4390613 sur une p riode de trois mois la diff rence est de 10 63 euros en faveur du conditionnement trimestriel
4390614 i would feel the same way if i were you
4390615 i knew all along that for us to spurt we needed to play better on the road
4390616 we needed to put more runs on the board and thats exactly what we have done
4390617 yeah it feels good to accomplish something but you can tell by the atmosphere in the clubhouse its pretty numb in here
4390618 im not happy obviously your expectations are high what i was worried about in my two rehab stars it came to fruition i was worried about how sharp i really was and how much i was able to do what i wanted to do
4390619 against a lesser lineup maybe i get away with some of that stuff
4390620 i definitely would have been upset if i had been thrown out of the game
4390621 i was thrown out of one here last year for no good reason
4390622 i tried to avoid the tag i tried to slide away from him i couldnt breathe it knocked the air out of me
4390623 nds needs to have the strategic agility and flexibility to enter into any type of value enhancing transactions news corporation has decided to reduce its ownership position in nds so that nds can capitalise on these new opportunities with a more independent structure and the expertise of permira
4390624 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit
4390625 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to the democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4390626 the challenge especially with small cars is to bring the price down to where more people can afford it and this is our goal for this new hybrid model to make it affordable to a new generation of car buyers
4390627 wat zie je er mooi uit ga je naar een feest

4390634 after almost two weeks of suffering with unbearable back pain and unable to get any sleep he was so weak and looked horrible
4390635 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me
4390636 because he could no longer withstand the suffering inside the facility
4390637 pee u do you ever stink what did you roll in
4390638 i came in with the best attitude ive had in any olympics
4390639 i think in the past i put too much pressure on myself i dont have to be the show or a great player i told myself coming in whether we finish first or we finish last as long as we play as well as we play and i play as well as i can play im happy with it
4390640 as much as id love a gold medal ive come to a realization it doesnt define me or my career
4390641 i think it put us on a course to perform well at the end
4390642 and obviously i dont know how all this is all going to turn out but i am real happy of the fact that we havent even played our best volleyball yet but weve played much more consistent and with much more energy and heart than the other teams thats what we have to pride ourselves on
4390643 he definitely stepped up in a role where hes talking a lot more and i think put a little bit more of himself out there for the team to use as an example
4390644 its great to have a guy thats been to four olympics hes played volleyball for such a long time and he has so much knowledge that i couldnt even imagine at this point in my life
4390645 i came in with the best attitude ive had in any olympics
4390646 i think in the past i put too much pressure on myself i dont have to be the show or a great player i told myself coming in whether we finish first or we finish last as long as we play as well as we play and i play as well as i can play im happy with it
4390647 as much as id love a gold medal ive come to a realization it doesnt define me or my career

4390657 mike and chris pioneered the genre more than 18 years ago and have shaped the sports talk format into what it is today
4390658 we wish chris nothing but the best and look forward to all that mike will do in a role in which he has excelled at for years
4390659 i didnt think about the streak until i started walking back on the mound
4390660 the first thought that popped in my head was i cant believe that just happened with a runner on first but i guess the good thing it wasnt a cheap one a whole bunch of things fell at once and so that way theres no pressure from this point on
4390661 carlos is a hit magnet the way he hits he stands over the plate
4390662 if carlos gets hit the way he gets hit i dont mind that but if he gets hit the way i dont think he should get hit then its a problem
4390663 its almost been like a no hitter type streak or something
4390664 unbelievable what hes done but ill get him right back out and try to start another one hes been tremendous
4390665 this type of win is whats been happening since early in the season when we started win a lot of games late
4390666 weve got our confidence up and we believe as long as we go on that field weve got a chance to win
4390667 i made the play and i never felt anything pop
4390668 we believe strongly that the changes we have made for the upcoming season as part of the pilot will have a very positive impact on the future direction of junior hockey in ontario
4390669 stronger franchise governance principles the use of division wide educational agreements meaningful reduced roster sizes mandatory play rules for 16 year olds reduced roster positions for 20 year olds the use of 2 referee systems amongst various other changes
4390670 the watered down product and quality of programs offered in a 36 team league has noticeably deteriorated in recent years as evident by the disparity of teams in all current divisions as well as the substantial reduction in opjhl players advancing to the next level be that the ohl cis ncaa or professional hockey
4390671 the central division is a good mission it is setting an example for junior
4390672 weve known for the last three years that something was going to happen the bone of contention is how did those eight teams get chosen it should have been an invite however it was done by all types of calls in the background
4390673 we understand that some of the teams in the opjhl are disappointed with the emergence of the central division however we are very encouraged by the number of those teams who have indicated to us that they support our vision our core operating principles and objectives and very much look forward to working with us closely
4390674 initially there will not be a major impact as the recruiting of players for this year was not based on this test pilot but rather the current system
4390675 change is never easy to manage and im sure there will be growing pains and challenges to educate in one year players scouts and associations as to why the concept will be beneficial to junior hockey long term
4390676 the intent of this pilot is to improve junior hockey as a whole across ontario at all levels this is a test pilot and it may prove to be only that a one year pilot but like anything else sometimes you need to isolate a small group to understand what changes are best for a wider group
4390677 some teams will survive the changes and some teams wont
4390678 potentially less teams over a larger geographic region would make for a more competitive product on the ice night after night which would benefit players wanting to develop for the next level be that the ohl cis or ncaa
4390679 we both supported each other 100 percent and we just wanted to go out there and give it our all and have fun because this is the games
4390680 its 20 years earlier that i competed in the olympic games
4390681 i was second in that one i guess its nice to fix the little mistake that i had so i am very proud of my baby
4390682 if i could have told you a month ago i would have said no that i was done
4390683 but after being here and experiencing the whole experience its just a dream come true id give anything to feel that again if i can in 2012 ill be there no matter what
4390684 there have been so many battles and injuries just to be at the olympic games is amazing
4390685 its really cool how its opened a whole new world to us and to everyone else
4390686 bmx is an exciting fresh sport and i know a lot of people are anticipating what its going to be for us this process i dont like we never thought this could happen
4390687 its kind of amazing bmx is going to be in the olympics im just in awe too
4390688 we were teasing water polo players to say we should set up a match just as long as the pool is shallow so some of my guys can touch the bottom in case they might not be able to swim and to not be too physical with us
4390689 we have a great rapport with our team those are our teammates
4390690 everyones hanging around and getting treatments or going about what they need to do to prepare for competition
4390691 its such a funny feeling because it kind of is like a college experience multiplied because everyones world class its kind of like having a whole team of stars
4390692 a lot of other national olympic committees have the expectation that organizers are going to take care of them
4390693 weve taken the initiative and been proactive to say let us control our destiny
4390694 now you really feel that were not individual sports but were all going as one
4390695 thats really the greatest feeling that its us against the world and i like that
4390696 if you get in a situation where you feel like youre alone the stress just seems to magnify
4390697 when you can share your experiences and your daily schedule with others its a camaraderie that lessens it and makes it enjoyable actually
4390698 everyones been around here because we come in and out for practice time
4390699 we all communicate we all talk and laugh and joke and i think thats great
4390700 im telling them that they need to get to bed
4390701 its going to be a big shock because never in history has taiwans team lost to mainland china in international play
4390702 for a long time we thought we had an advantage
4390703 we won a game and the last thing i want to do is talk about politics
4390704 taiwan has more than 30 years of baseball history so its a mature sport and for china its just starting
4390705 we both supported each other 100 percent and we just wanted to go out there and give it our all and have fun because this is the games
4390706 we were teasing water polo players to say we should set up a match just as long as the pool is shallow so some of my guys can touch the bottom in case they might not be able to swim and to not be too physical with us
4390707 we have a great rapport with our team those are our teammates
4390708 everyones hanging around and getting treatments or going about what they need to do to prepare for competition
4390709 its such a funny feeling because it kind of is like a college experience multiplied because everyones world class its kind of like having a whole team of stars
4390710 a lot of other national olympic committees have the expectation that organizers are going to take care of them
4390711 weve taken the initiative and been proactive to say let us control our destiny
4390712 now you really feel that were not individual sports but were all going as one
4390713 thats really the greatest feeling that its us against the world and i like that
4390714 if you get in a situation where you feel like youre alone the stress just seems to magnify
4390715 when you can share your experiences and your daily schedule with others its a camaraderie that lessens it and makes it enjoyable actually
4390716 everyones been around here because we come in and out for practice time
4390717 we all communicate we all talk and laugh and joke and i think thats great
4390718 im telling them that they need to get to bed
4390719 that would also create ground for us to return to the negotiating table
4390720 he is ready to resign but he is putting conditions like indemnity for the november 3 action
4390721 back door talks are still going on things have not yet been finalised lets see what happens
4390722 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4390723 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4390724 feel that their voices were heard and their views respected
4390725 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect sen obama president of the united states
4390726 the one thing you really have to do as a nominee is establish your dominance over the party
4390727 people want to see the presidential nominee controlling the convention
4390728 in the interest of being gracious and avoiding the alienation of the clinton people they basically folded
4390729 reluctantly conceded it was safer than having these people walk away from denver disgruntled
4390730 how do you handle this so you dont offend people who dont like the clintons
4390731 on the other hand you dont want to offend the clinton supporters

4390734 defra is proposing to consult on specific proposals later this autumn as part of the wider responsibility and cost sharing agenda
4390735 there were a couple of scares but we have won convincingly in the end and are obviously in a very strong position for the second leg
4390736 we need to tighten up defensively but im pleased to have won
4390737 but i wouldnt treat the second leg lightly at all our intention is to try to get through
4390738 since it is obvious we dont have any chance in the second leg we will concentrate on the league
4390739 the game was over before it began we let in two goals in six minutes when there was a total lack of concentration
4390740 i do not know if players showed aston villa too much respect which was not necessary
4390741 if you go two goals behind against such a team at home obviously it will be difficult but we tried and showed sometimes that we are a good attacking team
4390742 but in football you must also play defence and that we did not
4390743 when the 2008 focus range was first revealed to rcuk the izalco team immediately stood out as the pick of the bunch combining a reasonable price and a cracking spec the team sits third from the top in the izalco range and the frame aside from the integrated seat mast is virtually identical to the two above rarely does a bike manage to pack such a punch on paper with the teams spec comprising a full sram red groupset fulcrum 1 racing wheels and top end fsa carbon finishing kit not to mention the full carbon frameset nestled in between the sparkly components happily the team delivers once it is being ridden as its looks demand the oversized carbon tubes give the frame huge torsional stiffness steering is well balanced and out of the saddle climbing is a joy the low weight makes ascending something to savour and in the sprint for the town name signs its a match for any other bike a short headtube promotes a low racy and aggressive position so hands on the drops and head down is the position of choice and it is when in this mode that the team most excels around race circuits it absolutely thrives pitching you out of corners with a frightening velocity theres just enough flex in the frame to soften imperfections in the road but dont expect the team to reward those seeking a comfortable long distance cruiser for sportives its just not the teams cup of tea racing is where its at so for the budding racing seeking a well priced and top specced bike revel in the izalco team and it offers an engaging ride for riders seeking that quality
4390744 i expected it because its the truth and i know the truth always stands firm
4390745 its a great vindication and shows us the faithfulness of god
4390746 my personal point of view the lawsuit was a complete waste of time because the incident didnt rise to any kind of level i fly all the time ive seen a lot worse than that happen on airplanes
4390747 we gave the truth to the jury we are happy we had an opportunity to try our case
4390748 for the average american these inflation numbers are very bad news it means that their purchasing power has been cut and their wages arent going very far
4390749 all of their costs are rising very quickly and they are getting hammered
4390750 were retired and you can see it in the grocery stores
4390751 today we got the truly shocking news that inflation hit a 17 year high of 5 6 percent
4390752 families have now lost an entire decades worth of raises to inflation as weekly earnings adjusted for inflation lies below the level they reached in august 1998
4390753 if this administration were competing in the bad economic policy olympics theyd receive four gold medals today
4390754 it will take some time for the economy to turn around
4390755 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4390756 het zou mij niet verbazen als ik het onderwerp van haar verliefdheid ben
4390757 we hebben pasgeleden met elkaar gewerkt voor de film mijn vader is een detective en toen maakte zij een heel charmante indruk op mij wat opviel was dat ze heel moederlijk omging met de kinderen die op de set waren
4390758 a magistrate today set a 25 000 bond for detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick in connection with two felony assault charges filed by the michigan attorney generals office magistrate renee mcduffee of the 36th district court ordered the mayor to post 10 of a 25 000 bond or 2 500 for release on the new charges the mayor posted the bond this afternoon and was released mcduffee said she could impose conditions only on the case before her the two assault charges stemming from an altercation with wayne county law enforcement officers trying to serve a subpoena
4390759 kilpatrick who spent the night in wayne county jail on an unrelated criminal case appeared on a television screen in 36th district court to face the two felony assault charges mcduffee entered a not guilty plea for the mayor kilpatrick made no comment mcduffee then scheduled a preliminary examination for aug 15 kilpatrick attorney james thomas argued for a lenient bond saying that the mayor already has posted bond at considerable personal expense in relation with the perjury case against him
4390760 the latest charges pose yet another threat to the livelihood of the 38 year old mayor who has steadfastly remained in office while battling eight other felony charges and possible removal hearings by the city council and gov jennifer granholm the other criminal charges all relate to the text message scandal exposed in the free press in january
4390761 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4390762 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4390763 we have seen the total motorcycle participation in vehicle miles traveled go up
4390764 we might see more people moving to that mode of transportation
4390765 obesity is a huge problem within our society and among children
4390766 we just feel that banning one type of restaurant is not the answer to a healthy california
4390767 i happen to like the mcdonalds salads and i dont think we should be telling our residents where they can and cannot eat
4390768 nobody has any idea what fast food is and how you define it
4390769 are we going to ban the taquerias chinese food places
4390770 a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
4390771 when you talk about fast food restaurants youre thinking burgers and fries and chips and pizza
4390772 its important to keep things healthy but we also have to have choice when we have ordinances that limit businesses it sets a precedent that sometimes has wide ranging effects
4390773 i think people sometimes think we have to do something to make ourselves feel good regardless of whether it will have any effect
4390774 no matter how many fast food restaurants the city manages to keep out kids are going to find it somewhere
4390775 this worrying trend highlights the need to provide racially diverse and low income communities with healthier eating options and to take steps to curtail the increase in high fat low nutrition options like fast food
4390776 he is a very energetic coach who brings a lot of enthusiasm and passion to the game and we look forward to working together over the next few years
4390777 this is something that we talked about in the early part of the summer we knew that it was just a matter of time before we got it done
4390778 i love being a part of this organization and the direction that the team is heading i am extremely happy to be a part of it moving forward
4390779 during sleep individual components of a scene seem to become unbound
4390780 this allows us to selectively preserve only whats most important and worth remembering physiological and chemical changes in the brain during sleep appear to actively give emotional memories their staying power
4390781 there is a popular belief that the consequence of sleep deprivation is simply tiredness and that a good nights sleep on the weekend can completely reverse any deleterious effects of mid week deprivation
4390782 the many college students medical public safety and transportation personnel who practice such sleep bulimia depend on continued learning for the effective performance of their tasks a clear understanding of exactly how sleep loss contributes to a failure of memory consolidation should provide important arguments to help counter this cultural drift towards less and less sleep
4390783 marc is a player i looked at and i feel has got a little bit more developing to do
4390784 i think hes a good player and someone i will keep my eye on but i dont think hes someone harry redknapp wants to loan at the minute as hes a bit short himself
4390785 it is heartbreaking every time you dont play and one year sitting on the bench would not be good for my development
4390786 i have been trying to leave for a while because last season the week after i signed a contract i was told i wasnt playing
4390787 sven was telling me he wanted me to play and let me develop and every day he was asking me about my contract situation
4390788 but as soon as i signed the contract when i got to the hotel before playing newcastle away in september i was told i wasnt playing
4390789 at the time i was playing and i had a good offer of a good contract but it might have been a mistake to sign for the four years
4390790 i think we need to stop talking about the new signings
4390791 the manager the chairman whatever it is they have to do they are going to do it for the best of the club
4390792 they know what theyre doing the manager is very keen to bring in top players and hes been waiting he doesnt want to bring us two names he wants to bring three of four class players
4390793 weve got three weeks now left of the transfer window so hopefully we will do it
4390794 cedia expo is the largest trade show in this industry and we all want to come away from it with our pockets filled with leads of interested integrators whove visited our booths
4390795 but what about the thousands of integrators who attended the show but didnt have a chance to visit with you
4390796 but we dont just have a database we maintain that database as well something that is especially important since email addresses change so frequently companies that try to maintain their databases themselves frequently find that the email addresses they have are no longer valid our integrator database is a living entity and we keep it at 10 000 integrators
4390797 this new custom program includes newsletter creation spam filter testing database blasts forensic analysis and more based on client needs
4390798 we got into this business because of our passion for music and producing these kinds of events for our dealers is such a blast
4390799 den meget st rke mand som mussolini ubetinget er er netop hvad det misregerede italienske folk tr nger til
4390800 nu ved v lgerne at folkestyret er forvandlet til et rent partistyre uden hvilket saglige hensyn skubbes til side for de partipolitiske og derfor kan man g ud fra at et flertal af v lgerne oprigtigt nsker diktaturet som den eneste udvej til sunde forhold i statsstyret
4390801 der vil ogs kun blive gr dt t rre t rer ved weimar forfatningens grav
4390802 det tyske diktatur betyder s ledes b de en fordel og en fare for europa en fordel fordi der derved er rejst et st rkt bolv rk mod kommunismen og socialdemokratiet p samme tid er blevet sat grundigt p plads og en fare fordi det forel big ikke kan undg at for ge sp ndingen og nerv siteten for en ny krig
4390803 mussolini reddede italien fra den kommunistiske syndflod som et udueligt parlamentarisk styre havde gjort det modent til og ingen kan vel bestride at hans diktatur har v ret en velgerning for det italienske folk
4390804 naar man har fulgt j desp rgsmaalet i europa i aartier kan man til en vis grad forstaa tyskernes animositet overfor j derne ogsaa hvis man ser bort fra de raceteorier der betyder saa meget i den nationalsocialistiske verdensopfattelse vi ved at titusinder af j der ford mmer de j diske forretningshajer de j diske pornografispekulanter og de j diske terrorister men alligevel kan det ikke ben gtes at de erfaringer som tyskerne som mange andre fastlands folk har gjort med hensyn til j derne danner en vis basis for deres forf lgelser man maa indr mme tyskland at det har ret til at skille sig af med sine j der
4390805 la nation a inflig des dommages importants et des souffrances de nombreux pays notamment aux peuples des pays asiatiques
4390806 jexprime ici au nom de la nation de profonds remords et mes sinc res condol ances toutes les victimes
4390807 jai pri pour que les mes de ceux qui ont offert leurs vies pour le pays reposent en paix
4390808 il est incompr hensible que ni le premier ministre fukuda ni lempereur ne viennent rendre un hommage
4390809 le gouvernement est pleinement conscient des difficult s de la situation conomique
4390810 hes talking a little bit more than he usually does motivating guys
4390811 this fall he knows the defense so i dont even have to look over there or worry about whats going on hes making his checks and hes confident in what hes doing out there
4390812 we dont have a strong safety and a free safety
4390813 we have a left safety and a right safety were moving back and forth to see who can do what it might get established later on but its nothing right now
4390814 hes certainly learned more and more and more about playing defense back
4390815 we moved him over and he played linebacker in high school its a little bit of a work in progress to kind of get him to learn all the little innuendo things about playing the deep part of the field hes made a lot of progress hes a lot more confident hes a good tackler
4390816 i was 220 when i weighed in but i dropped down to 213 ill probably be playing around 215
4390817 last year i was a little stressed but i had to work through it just not playing football
4390818 hopefully we can get all the details worked out in the near future
4390819 im not certain it would be wise or prudent to embark on another major fundraising campaign for athletics right now
4390820 we do not want to get out in front of the president
4390821 we are working with architects davis architects of birmingham to be ready when we get the nod from the president we dont know yet when that will be
4390822 i told him that i was offering him the position that hes taken now
4390823 i also told him that i was aware that a lot of people would like to have my job but i like it too
4390824 i think mal wants me to be involved with that
4390825 my understanding is that all facets of the department will report through me to coach moore i would think that he wants me to be involved in every aspect of the program
4390826 i was coaching as an assistant on paul bryants football staff when dave was playing basketball in the early 1970s so when the opportunity came up to visit with dave i wanted to do so
4390827 he came up during basketball season and stayed here three or four days at the time there wasnt any more thought behind it it was just a visit but later i thought he would be really good for our department and felt that hiring hart would give me an opportunity to do some of the things i want to accomplish
4390828 price told me that there was no problem with hiring dave hart
4390829 in fact he said that hart had taken the high road in this
4390830 my visit with dr robert witt the president of ua made a great impression on me
4390831 it just feels good to be here it feels good in my guts it feels good in my heart
4390832 this place is very very special our past is very important our present is very special but i am focused on the future
4390833 i feel like every program should excel when coaches have facilities resources and administrative commitment you should expect excellence
4390834 at the same time everything ebbs and flows on the heels of what football accomplishes
4390835 blessed to be coming back to alabama at this particular time
4390836 nicks vision where he wants to go was part of my reason for coming here
4390837 right now i am just trying to listen and learn its important to gain knowledge of the existing structures i want to get a feel for things and then discuss with mal if we need to do anything differently i didnt come because i thought mal was ready to retire because i know hes not
4390838 i also wanted to do something i was passionate about i am passionate about this place this is a very very special place
4390839 a little more intensity better enthusiasm more guys playing with the kind of intensity wed like to see on a day to day basis i think we made some improvement
4390840 his leadership has been a real positive on the development of our offensive team
4390841 the biggest thing with our young players is they have to be able to stay focused on the process of what they need to do to be complete players at their position
4390842 in some cases they came in and thought they would be able to make a significant impact and some of them will be able to do that
4390843 they tend to personalize everything because theyre frustrated because theyre not getting the kind of results theyd like to get
4390844 they have to be able to not get frustrated and be able to stay focused on the things they need to do to get better
4390845 weve been able to stay fairly healthy knock on wood
4390846 hopefully we can continue to do that and continue to improve as a team and practice smart so well be able to do that
4390847 we try to practice safe and we try to stay off the ground
4390848 we try to play fast play blocks stunt people but we try to stay off the ground
4390849 two guys last year were injured in practice because one guy got cut and another guy got drug down from behind which is not the way we want to do it
4390850 all i can tell you is when i go home at night
4390851 oh my last company didnt allow me work with that but ill be able to grab that in a day
4390852 pattern x is better than pattern y why youre choosing x
4390853 why are you doing z in this way who taught you this
4390854 i have done research on db normalization and you teach me schema
4390855 what happened with the company x you were working on
4390856 look here has suffered a minor problem which will stop her running at york next week
4390857 she is also doubtful for the st leger and i will be making no further comment at this stage
4390858 i didnt come here to make the cut ive got to do well to make my card and avoid the qualifying school
4390859 i think my game is pretty consistent i can see myself finishing top 20 quite a few times and if i have a good putting week that can be top 10 top five

4390867 i got spanked by the pool on the bare butt by my mom and dad they just used their hands but my butt hurt alot
4390868 we were looking for the best offer for the country they the government have used their numbers to push it through
4390869 i dont think its really set in but i feel like this journey has been so long
4390870 standing on the podium and hearing olympic champion next to my name was a dream come true
4390871 i just knew that i had to give the routine of my life
4390872 i was pretty far behind but i couldnt control that i gave a great meet today that was probably my favorite moment finishing on floor because i knew i had given it my all and i couldnt change anything
4390873 its a feeling i dont think any father can describe
4390874 just to know that he was so close to the all around gold and didnt quite achieve it
4390875 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything
4390876 you can think about the what if what if what if
4390877 the chinese team is responsible for a lot of peoples dreams
4390878 this year has not been very good for china theres been a lot of disasters so these olympic games theres a lot of pressure its impossible not to be nervous and its how to cope with the nerves is our job and right now i feel very excited
4390879 if you play him enough times hes bound to have an off day
4390880 this is a very good team weve been talking about playing with our backs against the wall this will be a good test for us
4390881 its just hard coming off the individual competition you fence so hard and you only have so many days later
4390882 im not looking for excuses but we werent fencing up to our potential
4390883 its been a tough three games for us but the tournament is still in progress
4390884 after missing the first couple it seemed like i kept forcing it
4390885 it was totally in my head not taking the time to relax and put it where i needed to put it
4390886 i am very sad in a way because i feel i may have broken the tradition set by those archers who were before me
4390887 however i feel that by winning the silver it will make me crave the gold more and make me appreciate the gold more in the future so i think its a good experience
4390888 the skill as far as im concerned is having learned the tricks to effect a professional finish in as short a time as possible fewer hours spent on a piece by carefully planning the steps involved in an economical way reducing the need for clean up etc
4390889 chen ying burst into tears when she found out over the phone what her mother had done for her
4390890 my girl won the gold medal it was worth suffering the pain alone for all that time
4390891 it was hard for me to admit that i had lied to her i just wanted her to be able to concentrate 100 percent on her shooting i know how hard she has trained for the olympics over the past four years
4390892 im really fed up with the pain the treatment causes me but i know my next session will be a lot easier because i will have my daughter there to hold my hand
4390893 if everyone who wanted a volt could get one that would be the dream
4390894 i dont know if there is any other vehicle or any other technology that has generated this kind of interest because of the state of the market and gas prices
4390895 the nuclear agreement that we are negotiating with developed countries will end indias nuclear isolation it will open up new opportunities for trade in dual use high technologies and nuclear materials and equipment opening up new pathways to accelerate industrialization of our country it will enable us to provide electricity to meet the needs of our farmers our artisans our traders and our industry
4390896 we must apply modern science and technology to find long term solutions to our energy problem our crude oil and gas reserves are limited we must find alternative energy sources i would like our scientists and engineers to find ways in which we can make better use of solar energy wind energy biogas and other sources of energy
4390897 all over the world there is growing realization of the importance of atomic energy to meet the challenge of energy security and climate change it is a clean environmental friendly and renewable source of energy indias atomic scientists and technologists are world class they have developed nuclear energy capacities despite heavy odds
4390898 woah wouldnt it be like totally cool if we like got married

4390900 we were being very focused on data and targeting students who needed the extra push
4390901 a slow phase in of a bigger dependent exemption would provide no benefit whatsoever to 101 million families who do not have children or other dependents or who have a low income
4390902 why they didnt just argue that there are few that care about rich yuppies taking a tax hit i dont know
4390903 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4390904 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4390905 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4390906 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4390907 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4390908 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4390909 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4390910 het is geweldig om op deze wijze aan concrete hulpverlening te doen en mee te helpen het transport in oekra ne te krijgen het is wel een hele onderneming maar we nemen de reguliere rusttijden goed in acht
4390911 fantastisch toch dat de stichting spoetnik zoiets organiseert de mensen kunnen de goederen goed gebruiken je komt in oekra ne werkelijk vijftig jaar terug in de tijd en als je daar niets doet dan gebeurt er ook niets ik hoop dat we daar allemaal veilig en gezond langs de controleposten komen
4390912 de gezondheid van kinderen is enorm belangrijk maar een school sluiten is niet niks we zijn zo zorgvuldig mogelijk geweest
4390913 het gezin heeft twee jaar geleden al voor het eerst bij de alliantie aangeklopt maar er gebeurt niets het geduld mag wel een keer op zijn wij zijn van mening dat er sprake is van een strafbaar feit het is dus niet meer dan normaal dat justitie daar naar gaat kijken
4390914 zij wijzen op mechanismen die verschillen tussen beide geslachten kunnen verklaren boeiend is ook dat het verschil tussen jongens en meisjes optreedt tijdens de vroege puberteit
4390915 uit een recente opiniepeiling blijkt dat de republikein daar een kleine voorsprong heeft op obama door nu in georgia campagne te gaan voeren dwingt obama zn rivaal om in georgia actiever te worden meer dan mccain in ieder geval van plan was in deze solide rode staat dat gaat mccain dus extra geld kosten dat hij liever zou besteden aan twijfelstaten obama heeft veel meer geld tot zijn beschikking en maakt het mccain financieel dus moeilijk hij deed in de voorverkiezingen hetzelfde in zijn strijd tegen hillary clinton obama dwong haar bijvoorbeeld om in pennsylvania meer geld uit te geven dan zij van plan was en tot haar chagrijn kijkt zij mede door dat soort manoeuvres nu tegen een miljoenenschuld aan
4390916 tijdens deze presidenti le campagne van hem hoor ik echter eigenlijk niets waarin hij verschilt van de president op het gebied van ons catastrofale beleid in irak het onverantwoorde fiscale beleid enzovoort het risico is eenvoudigweg te groot dat hij gekozen wordt daarom steun ik de groep republikeinen voor barack obama
4390917 om iets te doen aan de doorgeschoten partijdigheid in washington
4390918 dat was een leuk mediabedenksel maar het is uiterst onwaarschijnlijk toegegeven hagel is fel tegen het irakbeleid van zn partijgenoot bush maar uit zijn stemgedrag in de senaat blijkt dat hij op vrijwel elk ander terrein veel te conservatief is voor de democraten ik zie hem daarom niet als potenti le running mate maar acht het niet onwaarschijnlijk dat obama eenmaal gekozen hem in zn regering vraagt zulke overstappen zijn tenslotte niet ongebruikelijk wel ongebruikelijk is dat een groep prominente republikeinen zich inzet voor de kandidaat van de tegenpartij als ik mccain was zou ik mij daar zorgen over maken
4390919 perhaps we were a bit behind them in terms of sharpness and match fitness but that is no excuse in the first half we had too many unforced errors we needed to be more dynamic show more personality and to try to drive the play
4390920 we need to get up to speed before the weekend and hopefully this game will let us know where we are at and what we need to do
4390921 we did not pay an agent when benjani joined from auxerre and his transfer to manchester city was approved at the time by the premier league and the fas compliance unit
4390922 this is nothing more than a technicality which we will strongly contest
4390923 fortunately no one was seriously injured by these violent acts
4390924 however i fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt or even killed because of the research they perform or merely because they live in the same home as one of the targets
4390925 uc researchers and staff along with their spouses and children live in daily fear for their safety
4390926 the escalation of violence has grown at an alarming rate
4390927 maybe they didnt know the names of any single player in our team
4390928 maybe they made stupid decisions because they lost the ball and thought it would be so easy to get it back
4390929 we certainly werent there this evening we did not play at a level we expect to i believe we have good players here but unfortunately we did not get the performance we needed from the vast majority of them
4390930 mike and chris pioneered the genre more than 18 years ago and have shaped the sports talk format into what it is today

4390958 the crime here is that people think they can protect themselves against inflation by investing in a bond that increases its principal by a flawed inflation gage like the cpi
4390959 the signs were seeing in the tips market right now are very conflicting
4390960 prior to this latest report on thursday the ppi producers price index had been running hot while the cpi hadnt been going up much at all
4390961 but now that the cpi has really jumped inflation is bound to receive more attention from both consumers and investors
4390962 while some goods and services are clearly going to be more expensive others are clearly going to be cheaper
4390963 it doesnt appear to be one of massive hyper inflation that would most benefit an etf
4390964 they work much like a tips fund but a cd will protect your principal as well which is appealing to more conservative investors interested in holding tips as part of their long term allocation strategy

4390976 rick joyner is one of a new breed of super prophet in our day a breed which desires nothing less than to redefine biblical christianity in these last days of the church
4390977 a true god chaser is not happy with just past truth he must have present truth god chasers dont want to just study from the moldy pages of what god has done theyre anxious to see what god is doing
4390978 occasionally look at people and know details about them such as problems they were having or spiritual callings on their life
4390979 lack of intimacy with the lord had caused him to lean more on formulas and procedures than the anointing that is essential to giving life to truth
4390980 was again called back into ministry by the lord with the word that his commission would be given to another if he did not return at that time
4390981 it is typical of our western mind set to want a clear formula for how to get to know the voice of the lord there must at least be an obvious how to in the scriptures we think many have attempted to wrestle one out of the word but it is not there the only way we can come to know the voice of the lord is the same way that the sheep came to know their shepherds voice through time spent in his presence
4390982 the scriptures alone are used for establishing doctrine while the voice of the lord is used to give us day to day guidance as well as revealing the strategic will of the lord the bible does not address some of the most important decisions we must all make whom we should marry our choice of professions where we should live
4390983 reproof correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work
4390984 thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path
4390985 many protestant and reformed theologies not only hinder but actually prohibit christians from knowing gods voice these theologies can be traced to the extreme interpretation of the prime reformation motto
4390986 we all would like to have a basic formula for interpreting dreams but there simply is none
4390987 there are only two ways to please a woman and nobody knows what they are
4390988 morningstar already has bought over 300 acres in the pores knob n c community with moving its headquarters there from charlotte joyner and his family moved to a house near the intersection of price and broyhill roads in late 1997 and there are plans to provide housing for 40 to 50 other families moving here with morningstar joyner has said events leading to the move to the pores knob community began with a man in kansas city dreaming joyner moved to a place in north carolina the man also dreams joyner would meet recording star ricky skaggs a few weeks later joyner met skaggs skaggs is on the morningstars board joyner said he felt god was leading him to visit the pores knob section of moravian falls and he did so in 1989 joyner said it caught his attention when he learned that moravian falls was a center of newspaper publishing around the turn of the century and that one of the early newspapers was called the morning star

4390990 some of the revelation came in open visions these were visible external visions that were like watching a cinema screen others were gentle internal visions that are like having the eyes of your heart opened i now have frequent visions and dreams that are filled with symbolism requiring interpretation like most of the biblical visions but these were not that way many of the details that you read in this book i actually saw in the visions some of the understanding shared in this book came in literal conversation with the lord i did not hear his voice audibly but it was more intimate and real than i could ever remember knowing before
4390991 one of the primary forms of false prophets who try to infiltrate the body of christ they will usually have a clean professional appearance and will often establish their credibility by prophesying information that they know in the natural
4390992 the most severe difficulties will come from the panic generated by the situation
4390993 the lord told me to observe the problems that y2k will cause in the natural world as a reflection of the problems we have in the body of christ
4390994 devoted to the distribution of strategic prophetic words dreams and visions that have critical timeliness
4390995 your name is prophetic there is a new zeal that will arise from the church in new zealand this zeal for the lord and his purposes will help to bring conviction upon the worldwide body of christ for her laodicean spirit of lukewarmness your zeal will be a new zeal
4390996 even though i have not been able to go to journalism school or even bible school in many ways i would not trade my education for anyones like paul i can say that what i received i did not receive from men
4390997 there are no direct statements of scripture to support the fallible prophet concept
4390998 in any case how this passage can indicate that new testament prophets are inferior to old testament prophets is not clear since the entire congregation of israel was also told to scrutinize their prophets deut 18 22 the word diakrino does not imply that there is both good and bad to be sifted out it is often used in a context such as this in reference to rendering judgment between two people that is determining which one is right and which one is wrong d a carsons statement that discern refers to judging the prophecy itself if correct would mean to judge whether the entire prophecy were true or false it would mean not to sift out the good from the bad and consider the good parts as from god and the prophet as a genuine prophet this is contrary to biblical practice it does not imply that there are true and false statements in all new testament prophecy or that a genuine prophet may give false prophecies
4390999 this doctrine is used i think to intimidate any who may criticize into thinking that by doing so they are operating under the spirit of satan
4391000 in the near future the church will not be looking back at the first century church with envy because of the great exploits of those days but all will be saying that he certainly did save his best wine for last the most glorious times in all of history have now come upon us you who have dreamed of one day being able to talk with peter john and paul are going to be surprised to find that they have all been waiting to talk to you you have been chosen to see the harvest the fruit of the seeds that they were planting
4391001 miracles which exceed even some of the most spectacular biblical marvels will cause whole nations to acknowledge jesus the appearances of angels will be so common that they will cease to be related as significant events the lord himself will appear to councils of apostles and elders to give them directives
4391002 a new wave of ministries is about to be released with extraordinary prophetic gifts others with revelatory gifting who were sidetracked because of controversy or other problems are about to get back on the fast track the apostolic ministry that opened the church age will be raised up at the end to complete it the lord is restoring the apostolic authority to the church and soon this will become a major emphasis there will be almost a general openness to this as men of true apostolic authority with a true apostolic lifestyle take their place in leadership
4391003 the result of the last ten years of hearing from the lord both in visions and revelations
4391004 i have allowed you to see a little into the future
4391005 at the end of the vision in the call i saw the glory of all ages in a single moment
4391006 religious authority in mormonism includes the concept of continuing revelation through the current church president who holds the titles of seer prophet and revelator
4391007 his big thing is the great christian civil war like the american civil war the coming spiritual civil war will also be between the blue and the gray in dreams and visions blue often represents heavenly mindedness the sky is blue and gray speaks of those who live by the power of their minds the brain is often called gray matter this will be a conflict between those who may be genuine christians but who live mostly according to their own natural minds and human wisdom and those who follow the holy spirit the morning star prophetic bulletin may 1996 2
4391008 the violent images joyner adopts are it seems to be directed
4391009 for the first time in this letter paul ventures a name for the new evangelists in corinth they are superlative apostles huper lian apostoloi v 5 they were spiritual hupermen they were superlative because they claimed to go beyond paul and others in both message and life paul made christians in name they made christians in spirit paul accented a crucified messiah who gave grace they brought a glorified messiah who gave power paul brought the spirit but they brought him fully paul in other words brought something of the gospel but they brought the full gospel yet paul now declares and the fact that he must even say it strikes us as somehow pathetic i think that i am not the least inferior to these ii cor 11 5 however his commendable self control will not last much longer
4391010 paul finally explodes those who found him worldly because weak less christs because less their more and who knew how to make full what he only knew how to begin i e to over huper do him he must now call by name they are not only superapostles they are sham apostles pseudapostoloi and crooked in all their practices masquerading as apostles of christ 11 13 neb
4391011 this move of god will be so powerful that the church will gather in stadiums to worship both the church in given regions as well as some local churches which will grow so large that they will fill stadiums for their celebration worship services the government of god sic kingdom will be established through the apostolic and prophetic authorities in cities and nations we will see tremendous transfers of wealth into the kingdom of god through the ministry of market apostles those with apostolic anointing for business and other areas of society
4391012 i have experienced a considerable amount of prophecy in my own life after my conversion in 1971 i have had at times an ability to foresee certain future events accurately but usually in a very general sense i could also occasionally look at people and know details about them such as problems they were having or spiritual callings on their life
4391013 these great prayer movements will result in such extraordinary advances for the church and deliverance for the world that the worlds great and mighty will come to the church for prayer even the public schools in the united states will beg for prayers to be made in their halls again
4391014 then after seven years with no prophetic revelation i had a three day prophetic experience in which i felt the lord tried to catch me up on all i had missed since then i have had other visions and revelations that were published in books like the final quest and the call all of a sudden i knew many details about future events as though they had been poured into me in all of this i have been trying to determine gods call on my life and his purpose for his church
4391015 faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god
4391016 because apostles are called to be evangelists prophets pastors and teachers they usually have a more balanced nature and are given for the purpose of keeping the church on the right path
4391017 i am with you always to the very end of the age
4391018 if anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which accords to godliness he is proud knowing nothing from such withdraw yourself
4391019 reading his material is similar to reading new age materials his approach is to take anything in scripture and make it mean anything that suits his theological aims there is no faithfulness to established facts of interpretation it is a smorgasbord of ideas loosely connected with the generous use of out of text scripture to prove his point
4391020 the good word of god and the powers of the age to come
4391021 the good word of god and the powers of the age to come
4391022 i determined not to know anything among you except jesus christ and him crucified
4391023 the church will be a great hospital with the power to heal every kind of wound and disease she will have a cure for every plague
4391024 the age to come is the millennial age what a change there will be when god the son reigns on earth personally and his chosen people are saved these hebrews had seen attesting miracles performed the performance of which proved to them that the new testament was from god this was another factor which made their guilt so enormous it is interesting to note in passing that attesting miracles will again be performed in the millennial age when the lord jesus comes back to earth
4391025 some argue that personal prophecy should always come as confirmation based on the scripture this misconception is simply the result of faulty hermeneutics
4391026 few who devote themselves to studying cults or deviant doctrines are able to distinguish the true word of the lord and usually their hearts are ultimately darkened by the very evil they seek to expose we will be changed into that which we are beholding ii corinthians 3 18 there is an implied warning in the lords message to the church in thyatira about knowing the deep things of satan revelation 2 24 the more we focus on what is wrong or the practices of the evil one the more we ourselves will be changed into the nature of what we are seeing
4391027 bonhoeffers life is one of the twentieth centurys greatest examples of how a few who hold to the truth without compromise standing against the most powerful political and military machines in history with nothing but spiritual power will ultimately prevail
4391028 i dont mean to be critical of people but i do want to speak the truth in love and one of my pet peeves is when i see people especially those who consider themselves to be and present themselves as theologically conservative praise dietrich bonhoeffer bonhoeffer espoused a so called religionless christianity and expressed doubt about god as a working hypothesis he was a father of the so called death of god fad of a few years ago he wrote a lot and also wrote some things that sounded orthodox but he consistently had a low view of the bible considering a lot of it myth
4391029 in his book christ the center 1960 harper amp row bonhoeffer wrote so if we speak of jesus christ as god we may not speak of him as the representative of an idea of god who possesses the properties of omniscience and omnipotence there is no such thing as this abstract divine nature p 108 so bonhoeffer didnt really believe that jesus is god bonhoeffer didnt think that jesus is sinless either the assertion of the sinlessness of jesus fails if it has in mind observable acts of jesus his deeds are done in the likeness of flesh they are not sinless but ambiguous one can and should see good and bad in them p 113 so bonhoeffer rejected classical christology had a low view of the bible denied the deity of christ doubted the virgin birth of christ denied the sinlessness of christ and doubted the physical resurrection of christ
4391030 jesus looked down from the cross at his tormentors without wrath or retaliation but with mercy he prayed father forgive them they dont know what theyre doing luke 23 34 these were not idle words he meant it he is not waiting until he comes again to get even he forgave them
4391031 him you have taken by lawless hands have crucified and put to death
4391032 if indeed jesus unconditionally forgave those who crucified him then of course that would mean they had been forgiven without hearing or believing the gospel clearly that teaching is heretical on the cross jesus did not forgive he prayed the same is true of steven if forgiveness is unconditional jesus stephen and others would have forgiven their murderers rather than use what if true would be a roundabout way to do so we believe also that his prayer was answered how could that be not apart from the means but by them jesus prayer was answered in the response to the preaching of peter and the apostles on the day of pentecost they were not forgiven the sin of crucifying the saviour apart from believing that he was dying for their sins but precisely by doing so in response to the faithful preaching of the gospel in jerusalem we do not have to resort to some strange doctrine of the forgiveness of sins apart from faith in christ in order to explain christs prayer
4391033 i will ascend to heaven i will raise my throne above the stars of god and i will sit on the mount of assembly in the sides of the north i will ascend the heights of the clouds i will make myself like the most high
4391034 there is a tendency to continue relating to him as the man from galilee jesus is not a man he was and is spirit he took the form of a servant and became a man for a brief time
4391035 jesus is not a man he was and is spirit
4391036 the incarnation constituted him a complex person constituted of two natures he is the god man the one divine person who possessed a divine nature from eternity assumed a human nature and now has both
4391037 there is one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus
4391038 faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god
4391039 faith is not just believing the words of the lord but believing the word himself
4391040 it would be impossible to put a value on this most marvelous gift the lord has given to us but the bible was given to lead us to jesus not to take his place
4391041 he who rejects me and does not receive my words has that which judges him the word that i have spoken will judge him in the last day
4391042 the church must be ruled and guided by the head rather than by formulas he is purposely vague concerning even important issues so that we have to seek him the new testament is full of the best counsel the world has ever heard but the lord and his apostles were careful not to lay down many general rules and regulations for the churches they knew that every rule could prevent that church from seeking the lord for themselves
4391043 i write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth
4391044 the lord and the apostles were careful not to lay down many general rules
4391045 i cherish the great people i worked with at apple and i am proud of my contributions to its historic turnaround and current success
4391046 with this lawsuit behind me i look forward to addressing the greater challenges of social justice and economic disparity
4391047 one thing important about this case was that it involved a general counsel who fabricated corporate documents to conceal the fraud
4391048 thats the type of conduct the commission takes very seriously
4391049 theres nothing i can say transfer speculation will go on for the next few weeks

4391053 fcc has concluded an investigation of potential racial and ethnic biases in its methodology

4391055 however we are committed to continue our voluntary discussions with the fcc as well as with the new york city council and with black owned and spanish language radio to explain fully the portable people meter system
4391056 arbitron has great respect and appreciation for the work of the new york city council and for the critical and unique role that black owned and spanish language radio plays as voices for the diverse communities of new york
4391057 arbitrons role as an independent research company is to provide stations and advertisers with information that is based on the actual behavior of radio audiences that is what ppm delivers today

4391063 i didnt think about the streak until i started walking back on the mound
4391064 the first thought that popped in my head was i cant believe that just happened with a runner on first but i guess the good thing it wasnt a cheap one a whole bunch of things fell at once and so that way theres no pressure from this point on
4391065 carlos is a hit magnet the way he hits he stands over the plate
4391066 if carlos gets hit the way he gets hit i dont mind that but if he gets hit the way i dont think he should get hit then its a problem
4391067 its almost been like a no hitter type streak or something
4391068 unbelievable what hes done but ill get him right back out and try to start another one hes been tremendous
4391069 this type of win is whats been happening since early in the season when we started win a lot of games late
4391070 weve got our confidence up and we believe as long as we go on that field weve got a chance to win
4391071 i made the play and i never felt anything pop
4391072 this is a question that has bugged me for a long time
4391073 a healthy skeptic carefully and critically evaluates each piece of advice taking into account not only its source but the science behind it
4391074 to convey complex scientific information in this environment health promoters may resort to oversimplifying or sensationalizing
4391075 they may not necessarily lie to us but like anyone else trying to sell something they dont always give us the full truth either instead what we may get even from individuals and organizations with the most altruistic of motives is hype half truths and spin

4391082 theyre smart theyve been in the system you cant worry about age its how their health is and how they can play some of these young kids are up down up down a lot of those guys get saucer eyes going up against pro bowl defensive end jason taylor they probably want to get his autograph
4391083 they keep me vibrant they keep me young im having a good time i really am i think im doing something good to be around that long the teaching aspect is good get players who listen and youre in good shape
4391084 there isnt anyone on our staff who has more respect than joe bugel
4391085 he really kind of just walks around and you just want to be around him
4391086 he gets the best out of you he has taught me to be relentless to set the tempo of the game
4391087 yeah its just preseason but i dont think were going to do anything less than this all we can do is get better
4391088 got it out of the way so now i can just play football
4391089 because he didnt show signs of being able to adjust quickly enough we didnt give him a year to do it because we want now
4391090 hes a good athlete and he can do a lot of things but fitting into our scheme we didnt feel like he necessarily fit as quick as we need him to
4391091 i would love to be able to show that i can do more than just right tackle
4391092 ive never played center in a game and it would definitely be a great opportunity if the team needs a guard ill be ready to do it
4391093 i have my own soap opera i dont watch any of that stuff did he get traded really the jets and well see him next week wow it will be a real circus certain guys carry that circus with them and brett is one of those guys not in a bad way he just has that aura about him
4391094 i know what im capable of doing and if i do that i dont think the decision will take that long to make
4391095 im a gamer ive shown im good enough to play in this league there are things i can bring to this team that he cant directional punting i have the ability to stop people from scoring with a tackle when theres a breakdown in coverage and i pride myself on my consistency as a holder ive given three years of good service to this team but i know i could have been better the question has been how often im not at my best
4391096 marcus mason ended up getting 80 yards again most of it on the last drive which we really needed
4391097 we tried to pull him out and he kept himself in
4391098 he plopped on the ground one time to make a catch and bounced right up i thought he accelerated very well he seemed to be working right in as he progresses this week we could see him this weekend if everything goes well we could put him in now he has to get assignments route running understanding what is going on hopefully he has had a chance to study and listen so that we dont lose a step as he enters back in the groove
4391099 he is getting to take off start to work back into drills and really feel like he is a team member
4391100 that is going to be very exciting for him if we get him in at all this week it will be because he did very well in all the drill work really i would like to see him the following week more than anything
4391101 we are just trying to work him in and keep him going
4391102 he is going to play in preseason if it is this game or next game it just depends on how works in this week this is a work week reps especially individuals to see how well he can push off and change directions with his hamstring today it just wasnt perfect we are just going to keep watching

4391265 not to bring the situation in south ossetia to a danger point
4391266 has no doubt that the forcible seizure of military property was deliberately aimed at further aggravating the situation in south ossetia and undermining the russian georgian relations
4391267 never become part of an empire even of a former empire
4391268 these are our people our territory called georgia and it will never be called anything else
4391269 on peacekeeping operations and the situation in the conflict zones of georgia
4391270 for the past several days the situation in the georgian abkhazian and georgian south ossetian conflict zones has intensified the city of tskhinvali has been shelled by the georgian army with victims registered among civilians fighters and unmanned aircraft of the georgian air force have repeatedly violated the conflict territorial air zones in a terrorist attack a south ossetian police officer was killed georgian military set up a post at a strategic site near the village of sarabuki additional military equipment was moved from georgia into the conflict zone without any coordination with the joint peacekeeping forces which was registered by military observers including by the osce mission in georgia these actions point to an open and planned aggression against south ossetia which is the internationally recognized side in settling the conflict

4391305 weve been working on this online gaming economy project for 8 months now
4391306 and we have yet to see daylight the finance team is getting ansy because we have spent much more than we have gained
4391307 i think its a win win situation for everyone involved
4391308 and consumers stand to benefit greatly as well in the long run competition will only drive prices down and produce higher quality products
4391309 this just goes to show that proper research balanced with strict budgeting and investment practices will result in higher profits and corporate growth were excited and our investors are pleased many of them long time online gaming economy shareholders have been able to retire on the profits from our stock growth alone
4391310 while the numbers team is crunching data my team and i are focusing on important online gaming economy human behavioral patterns and psychological trends including buying patterns the impact of economic recession or boom and governnment mandates
4391311 this is an investment in our future and as such will not yield immediate results we need to look for the return 10 even 15 years down the road
4391312 its not really a race to see who finishes first as much as it is a general goal that we should all get to at some point in the future

4391315 we think that interest rates are going to fall from april and continue to fall at a modest but relentless pace with the repo rate reaching 9 early in 2010
4391316 i think its fairly likely now we are on hold unless we get any major bad news on the oil front
4391317 but im not sure interest rates will fall as soon as markets are discounting i sense that the central bank will want to be sure that the inflation scenario is clearly improving before that happens
4391318 the market doesnt seem to have enough risk premium for the spectrum of possible outcomes on the inflation front
4391319 we believe the repo rate will go to 9 so the entire yield curve has a fair bit further to fall
4391320 while the improved inflation outlook will result in an easing of monetary policy in 2009 the mpc monetary policy committee is unlikely to be aggressive
4391321 if current oil price and exchange rate levels are maintained a further sizeable decline in fuel prices can be expected in september
4391322 it is still too early to tell if the lower international oil price is a temporary phenomenon
4391323 the passport situation has just been resolved they have their passports now they will be leaving for south africa on the 6 pm flight there was no explanation
4391324 we cant travel without passports theres no point in any case the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this
4391325 this is a loud message to sadc we have been trying to tell president mbeki about things like this and people wouldnt believe us but now here it is for all to see
4391326 how can they talk about a deal that excludes a party that has the most number of seats in parliament and won the only presidential election recognised by the world
4391327 what is this programme when government doesnt have a clear measurement postponing issues on the poor is a problem because it shows that there is no urgency
4391328 i think they the government didnt get the response they wanted on the strategy now they wont engage in a formal process the fact is they said we needed a strategy so they must produce one the devil is in the detail
4391329 africa cannot afford not to have a china policy because even now unnecessary wars are being fought in africa about oil for china
4391330 only african nations can really guarantee m aritime s ecurity in african waters
4391331 whoever wants to protect chinese oil supply must secure cape waters whoever wants to stop oil flows to china must master cape depths
4391332 this is not just a malacca dilemma as some would think i suggest the threat exists also at the cape of storms
4391333 whether successive governments are more or less sympathetic to chinese oil dilemmas the south african navy needs more ships and more time exercising at sea so it can achieve its goals whatever they turn out to be

4391342 man muss sich den entwicklungsfortschritt eben auch vor ort nicht nur aus der aktenlage anschauen

4391347 absolute and improper control over every facet of johnsons current and future running career
4391348 there is overwhelming evidence that mr johnson is intellectually retarded
4391349 will be fighting this vehemently they do not believe there is any truth to any of the allegations
4391350 reeling from the events of the past few days he was desperate for any possible lifeline
4391351 she gave me a kiss and said i love you when she left at 6 30 p m then at 1 30 a m i get a call saying my kids missing
4391352 when i saw her in the hospital she didnt know where she was or how she got there
4391353 all i know ive heard from the news and this is about my own kid
4391354 shes covered in scrapes scabs and bruises her face got it worst
4391355 she actually doesnt remember a lot and im glad she doesnt
4391356 she cant even leave the apartment alone to get the mail
4391357 theres all this stuff on the internet saying what kind of mother it makes me angry
4391358 i didnt give permission for her to go to the birthday party
4391359 they say theyre victims but what kind of victims are they
4391360 they are worried and they do not know what they can do because no family member has a passport but they want to come to toronto to try and find out what is going on
4391361 the identity of the body has not been confirmed at this time
4391362 when we are trying to identify a body there are several ways in which to do so
4391363 i am missing him i cant believe what has happened
4391364 he is a good guy he is a kind guy a really generous guy always ready to help others
4391365 i am dust my life is mere specks of dust and what i talk will one day be dust
4391366 there are many good looking people in the world god knows why i fell in love with you i dont know what you think of me but i have given my heart to you
4391367 all of my worldly possessions were on their truck right down to my toothbrush
4391368 i felt i was being ransomed just to get it all back
4391369 i thought the presence of the police might encourage them to get on with the show but instead they charged me extra for the time spent talking to the police
4391370 they know they have you because you have to move on that day and they have all your stuff on their truck theres nothing you can do
4391371 that is the most critical part of the entire equation
4391372 driver will collect the full amount of money before unloading if a client is unable to make full payment we will store all the goods at our storage and client will be responsible to pay additional cost
4391373 it is considered an unfair practice for a person to use his her or its custody or control of a consumers goods to pressure the consumer into renegotiating the terms of a consumer transaction
4391374 consumers should also be aware of the 10 per cent rule in the act if an estimate is provided the final cost cannot exceed the original estimated price by more than 10 per cent
4391375 with the owner jason syed police advised jason that he did not have the right to keep the complainants belongings
4391376 i just wanted to step on it in the first 50 metres a little bit and try to get out to an early lead said phelps who led cseh by 36 of a second after the breaststroke
4391377 if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on and thats all i wanted to do
4391378 i tried to do a harder start in the first 100 metres but michaels breaststroke is awesome
4391379 i really couldnt care less if michael was in the pool or not it doesnt matter to me one bit it could be anyone beside me and ill race him
4391380 the water in front of me is all i care about added beavers who was clocked in 1 59 43 a little behind the canadian record 1 59 19 he counted in a preliminary
4391381 i cant complain about a seventh place at the olympics its something ive wanted to do for a long time
4391382 ive dreamed of being in the finals since i was young to finally get here made the 20 years of hard work worth it
4391383 i knew that was a hard double for ryan phelps said
4391384 i swam my own race every inch of the way and i feel i have more in me for finals
4391385 i was disappointed in how they have been communicating with the public
4391386 i would expect them to put out information that people can rely upon
4391387 this has to be over and above what their plans are for the year they have to take their responsibilities seriously
4391388 i told them what my expectations are going forward they have to provide a reliable accurate timely list of all sites by physically going there not looking at the phonebook
4391389 how could you lose track of a place with thousands of litres of propane youve said could be there and are supposed to be inspecting
4391390 we acknowledge the limitations of the list as it existed at that point in time
4391391 but certainly thats no indication that we do not have either the capacity knowledge or expertise to deliver on our safety commitment
4391392 were very confident we know what sites need to be inspected
4391393 two of the three opposition parties dont support the government and say we should be defeated mr dion says he doesnt support the government but wont say you know whether he will defeat us or not
4391394 i think that mr dion will have to make up his mind and i think quite frankly im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
4391395 we believe we should govern we believe we have a mandate we believe thats what the people want but we will not allow this parliament to be sabotaged because that is not in the long run interests of this country
4391396 being government means a lot more than just not being defeated in a confidence motion it means actually being able to pursue a legislative agenda
4391397 that is a real problem that is something that needs to be addressed
4391398 if youre dion and you say the best we can do is gain a minority and then prove ourselves then this is probably as good a time as ive seen in the data weve seen up until now
4391399 i dont think that anybody can take anything for granted and i still think that ontario is going to be a key battleground for the election
4391400 it is true to say parliament is not working well parliament is working very badly but that is a self fulfilling prophecy on the part of mr harper he doesnt want it to work any other way
4391401 from the point of view of members in the house and candidates who have been nominated and we have a lot of nominated candidates across the country i think theres a sense that people say enoughs enough lets clear the air
4391402 lets put an end to the harper policies and government take it to the canadian people
4391403 shouldnt play deaf dumb and blind while people are being hauled off
4391404 china is suppressing free expression despite its olympic pledge not to do so
4391405 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
4391406 the government probably thought it would be a good fa ade to put up during the olympics
4391407 now the whole thing appears to have been a public relations exercise
4391408 i think youre in china and supposed to cover the games
4391409 if you have questions like that you should go to the authorities of the public security
4391410 im going to inquire and at the next press conference youll have the answer
4391411 it is true that a government can legally require people to apply for permits to protest

4391432 i have come to the conclusion that this attack does not have any particularly aggravating features such as the use of violence but it is an offence which must be visited by a term of imprisonment

4391446 any tire thats put in a landfill site any tire thats burned in the u s or anywhere else is an economic opportunity lost for ontario
4391447 there are times in the year when we dont have enough for ontario recyclers and then there are times in the year when we have way too many
4391448 thats not what im hearing from the companies that are actually doing the recycling what ive heard from them is that they could always use more product

4391461 you know how i know your gay you listen to coldplay
4391462 i know im digging a hole for myself with the raptors and everything because the expectations are going to be there
4391463 i can play defence and i can play a different role i think thats hard for guys to accept sometimes but i just want to win
4391464 in 06 i was still trying to find out what that role was i was still trying to find myself and everything
4391465 it was frustrating because i wasnt playing well and if i wasnt doing what i was supposed to be doing i couldnt play
4391466 i think this time i kind of figured it out i kind of just let the game come to me and to be honest its a lot easier as long as i exert all my energy on defence run the floor and set screens ill play
4391467 he always seems to find himself in the right place at the right time and when we penetrate hes able to find a little crack or seam and be able to finish
4391468 and defensively he did a great job on the pick and roll and stopping their guards from penetrating he was getting steals and we converted them into easy points he did a fantastic job
4391469 good work commends williams flashing his familiar movie star smile as c toute the last of the group finishes his reps
4391470 i am so looking forward to the olympic 100 metres said williams who thinks usain bolt will outkick tyson gay and asafa powell at the tape tomorrow morning
4391471 the whole olympic thing just gives you the jitters with those three guys in that race thats what im looking for to see what kind of times they run
4391472 everybody makes mistakes in life and you cant hold on to that stuff you have to move on said the upbeat father of daughters sequoia 10 and syerra 6
4391473 there are two words forgiveness and forgiving forgiveness is forgiving the person and forgiving is forgiving the past
4391474 my dad has always said to me youre put on this earth for a reason and thats to give something back said williams
4391475 the seat must have had a weakness and it broke
4391476 we re glued it and i can train with it but i think for the race well borrow a bike from another country
4391477 you cant be good everywhere his coach huang yu bin pointed out reasonably
4391478 this medal it was so unexpected and i probably will not realize the significance of it until later caranobie said
4391479 i felt panic when i first started he admitted later coming off the giddy high of that earlier team gold china back on top of the podium after losing its title and not medalling at all in the group discipline in athens
4391480 then my coach asked me to take a deep breath
4391481 i thought my form in 2004 was quite good but even in such peak form i didnt get the gold it didnt make any sense to keep training
4391482 after i came back to china i was thinking of retiring but mr wong has been my coach for many years hes my mentor my friend my role model he said this doesnt necessarily mean you will never win and beijing is that opportunity
4391483 i seized the moment but he pushed me really hard even kicked me to the top of the podium
4391484 this is a very significant gold this year has not been a good year for china weve seen a lot of tragedies so olympic gold gives us a lot of pleasure
4391485 but even with that mistake it was a step forward i only scored 4 10ths lower than in team even with the fall
4391486 whats really holding me back is my pommel horse and the rings my other four events are right up there with the best in the world
4391487 it wasnt a perfect day for me but it was definitely good enough
4391488 i was able to relax a little more compared to qualifying
4391489 i dont care about this medal i wanted gold this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure
4391490 the first time i was at the olympics it was just more of an experience now i want to go out and do what i have been training all my life to do
4391491 no matter what you do there are going to be distractions but what you do and how you react to them determines your success
4391492 there are a lot of people walking around this pool with no medals at all
4391493 he is ready to resign but he is putting conditions like indemnity for the november 3 action
4391494 back door talks are still going on things have not yet been finalised lets see what happens
4391495 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4391496 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve i would ask local residents to be patient with us and to be assured that we will keep them updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can
4391497 the way i see it if youre going to build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style
4391498 wait a minute doc ah are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean
4391499 the way i see it if youre going to build a time machine into a car why not do it with some style
4391500 gruffs really nuts about the life of john z delorean and the crazy history behind the man and his machine
4391501 were hoping to be able to offer gruff a ride round in one as well so if anyones got a mint delorean they want to show off then let us know
4391502 this is a unique chance to see the very best of welsh talent in a different way
4391503 its our ambition to show the world why top music makers like gruff rhys continue to reinvent and revitalise the vibrant music scene in wales
4391504 this guy is treating our legal system like a revolving door and its time we closed the cell door on him
4391505 we will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4391506 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4391507 however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4391508 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4391509 shouldnt play deaf dumb and blind while people are being hauled off
4391510 china is suppressing free expression despite its olympic pledge not to do so
4391511 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
4391512 the government probably thought it would be a good fa ade to put up during the olympics
4391513 now the whole thing appears to have been a public relations exercise
4391514 i think youre in china and supposed to cover the games
4391515 if you have questions like that you should go to the authorities of the public security
4391516 im going to inquire and at the next press conference youll have the answer
4391517 it is true that a government can legally require people to apply for permits to protest
4391518 particularly if they wish to use public areas thats common
4391519 but international human rights law does not allow applications to be unreasonably denied for content of the protest for example
4391520 its one thing for us to lament from afar that were not doing as well as wed like at the beijing summer olympics but back home weve got to make an effort
4391521 its one thing for athletes and families to do their very best on their own but weve got to lend them more support
4391522 i think he wants to have confidence that technically we will manage it in a way where there are no glitches there will be no security issues that we will be able to move people about safely and efficiently that we will have a friendly positive environment and that we will secure some tv coverage in a way that we have not done before in canada
4391523 gary are your parents here your folks are they here
4391524 i want you to go over there and i want you to give your mama a kiss because once you get on that bus gary you aint got no mama no more you got your brothers on the team and you got your daddy now you know who your daddy is dont you gary if you want to play on this football team youre gonna answer me when i ask you who is your daddy

4391528 i want you to go over there and i want you to give your mama a kiss because once you get on that bus gary you aint got no mama no more you got your brothers on the team and you got your daddy now you know who your daddy is dont you gary if you want to play on this football team youre gonna answer me when i ask you who is your daddy
4391529 uh huh and whos team is this is this your team or is this your daddys team
4391530 now get on the bus put your jacket on first and then get on the bus
4391531 all the hard work and stuff that ive done over the last 23 years is what allowed me to get here
4391532 this is really the show this is where we get to have a good time
4391533 the doctors basically said sit on the couch for the rest of your life
4391534 i probably spent a thousand nights thinking gee if i could only wrestle again what would i do differently
4391535 i dont think its very often in life that you get to really grieve over something and then think about what youd do differently forever and then get a chance to actually do it
4391536 i had to hire a coach theres no canadian coach really the women and the freestyle men have dedicated coaches and a full time system
4391537 theyre all organized to get going ive been in the freestyle system long enough that i understand their organization and ive just done my own parallel organization
4391538 we dont often get to wrestle in front of a crowd
4391539 it was pretty cool to have the ball and be in the spotlight thats really why we train to get here to have the opportunity to win at this level
4391540 they thought i was crazier the last couple years before i made the olympic team now its really cool i cant keep up with the emails
4391541 i think i want to do some motivational speaking and i still want to be around sports and training
4391542 im not shutting down the wrestling so i can work 16 hours a day at a law firm
4391543 my next door neighbour just bought a 100 000 car
4391544 i remember six months ago sitting in his living room watching tv saying id much rather use that hundred grand to go to the olympics than have a car
4391545 i felt that for the sake of some of the younger ones it would be much better for me to restrict access
4391546 weve had some cases where wives came and girlfriends came and they hang around its not a positive environment
4391547 i dont see any other sport nhl guys dont take their wives to the stanley cup final and hang out between games at least i dont think they do and why should we be any different this is a professional sport also
4391548 i havent seen any flowers or chocolates on the front of my door yet
4391549 we have a young group of athletes who could surprise with their performance
4391550 but to climb on the podium its going to be very difficult it has to take some magical things track rarely offers magic
4391551 anybody who gets caught here theres something wrong with the medical professional that theyre working with or they dont have enough money to use something that is still undetectable
4391552 you know theres a couple of designer drugs out there theyre probably undetectable
4391553 with a few exceptions our sport is cleaner than it has been in a long time it definitely beats the 80s
4391554 theres a feeling out there that theres an inside announcement of wada asking for a visa
4391555 it should have been a chance for chinese soccer to be honoured but in the end it was dishonoured what has gone wrong there
4391556 there are athletes who have tested positive for drugs retired and are coaching right now
4391557 if you test positive and retire you should be banned from coaching for life
4391558 but i did not hear exactly what they were shouting i was completely in the excitement of myself
4391559 you can see whether i am fully fit now through how i played the match
4391560 it is just a rare chance to have the olympics on home soil and i want to see how far i can reach
4391561 it felt good because they obviously felt they could beat us they werent intimidated by us
4391562 when you face an opponent that doesnt really fear you youre playing for higher stakes
4391563 for us it was a challenge that we accepted for the way that they celebrated the last time when they beat the u s we knew this was going to be viewed as a first test and we responded
4391564 if teams get two points or three points we want them to feel like its a relief
4391565 we want them to feel like that was the hardest two or three points they ever got i think that just shows the whole spirit of the whole thing
4391566 through the middle of the work i was vomiting all over myself because i was just trying to push myself to keep up with the other guys
4391567 i couldnt stop and i didnt want to stop but my body was revolting
4391568 it was really hard but i had the motivation from the testing that things were working that i was going the right way
4391569 i dont think that can be considered parallel to the effort to bring women into absolutely equal gender balance
4391570 id be surprised and disappointed if we took such draconian action all it would do is have the athletes of that country suffer

4391593 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4391594 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4391595 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4391596 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4391597 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil
4391598 the root causes are many but beyond the macroeconomictriggers the immediate reason for the slide is the dollar
4391599 i am considerate of the environment but im doing it more for my own pocketbook
4391600 north dakota is the largest state in terms of carbon sequestration and program participation
4391601 we had a hail storm that hurt us really bad two years ago
4391602 we cant dabble in the business policies or the personnel policies of an airline
4391603 what we found was that because they carried less fuel on the airplane they were getting into situations where they had to tell air traffic control i need to get on the ground
4391604 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
4391605 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
4391606 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
4391607 the housing market has returned to earth fast and hard
4391608 you can walk into a mortgage company today and most are sitting around
4391609 we can see light at the end of the tunnel
4391610 it is an unfortunate event that has never happened in the history of the organization
4391611 were going to take a critical look at everything were doing and move forward toward a positive outcome
4391612 we feel we have rectified the problem and have a checklist to make sure it wont happen again
4391613 i have not heard anyone second guess his ability to lead
4391614 well learn from this mistake like any other business and do what we need to do to move forward

4391621 i looked up and saw the brick wall coming at us
4391622 i immediately turned and capt pittman was right with me so as we both turned and took a couple of steps we saw our other two guys with the hose and grabbed them
4391623 we just ended up crashing into the ditch it was just like a giant game of twister

4391627 the building used to be a warehouse for hardware we knew that it was pretty chopped up
4391628 theyre valuable things that people just dont want to lose
4391629 this is nothing new there do come times when you have areas where there are vacations or acute situations where you need to go out beyond your staff complement so this is normal practice for the capital district
4391630 by outsourcing 30 million of staffing time to private for profit companies the province is essentially saying that they do not have a solution to the shortages of health care workers in this province
4391631 rather than taking decisive forward looking action to respond to a crisis the province is throwing its hands up in the air and privatizing some elements of staffing
4391632 the province is abdicating its responsibility to provide a quality public health care system
4391633 in our household we actually put the scraps in the refrigerator until the night before
4391634 we put things like chicken scraps as an example in the freezer
4391635 then we put it out in the bin and its going to be less fragrant and therefore less attractive for the scavengers
4391636 just think about what youre putting out because theyre scavengers and theyre going to come looking for easy food sources
4391637 animals just see that as an invitation to dinner and do not put out that invitation unless you want them to come
4391638 he went through the sales and no one wanted to buy him a lot of people baulked at him because of his late form
4391639 we target old horses with good form and try to rejuvenate them with cedar manor the writing was on the wall we just looked for any damage
4391640 its like buying a car you get a horse from the sales and you get him home and hope and pray that theres not much wrong with them
4391641 hes had good form in the past weve just got to try and rejuvenate him
4391642 its better than waiting around for a yearling and wondering if hes going to be any good you win a lot of races but to get a horse of his ability and rejuvenate them is a challenge
4391643 you get attached to a new horse and hope you can get them firing the horse can be successful still a good old horse will still beat a slow young one bowen did discover a few minor problems the equivalent of a cracked tail light when the horse arrived but said he had improved significantly over the past six weeks were just bringing him along slowly
4391644 he worked along with instructed this morning and i was pretty impressed the owners were impressed and darron coleman jockey was impressed hes going to ride him
4391645 it just feels like hes a good horse this is 1400m first up he can race over further journeys than that hes going to improve immensely

4391701 enfermo que padece de delirios de grandeza y carente de talento
4391702 producto de rodearse de personas sin criterio incapaces de situarse cr ticamente frente a la realidad
4391703 los envidiosos vagos sin oficio que matan su tiempo en un foro o en una bit cora personal o quienes como focas aplauden todas sus estupideces
4391704 personas tan inferiores que decidan alinearse con tales personajes a cambio de una lisonja
4391705 cualquier atisbo que signifique riesgo a su ego es inmediatamente manejado bajo los efectos de su anomal a el enfermo transmuta en cualquier cosa con tal de desprestigiar a sus imaginarios oponentes e inmediatamente hacer alarde de supuestas virtudes
4391706 probablemente todo sea ocasionado por grandes carencias a nivel afectivo volitivo y sexual
4391707 lo mejor es ignorarlos y hacerse totalmente inmune al veneno que proyectan en todas direcciones
4391708 ummmmmmmmmmmm depende son mafias peligrosas y no por ignorarlos se puede neutralizar el efecto devastador de sus arremetidas
4391709 j amp a los problemas sexuales la falta del desahogo natural las descompensaciones hormonales traumas y rollos a ese nivel desencadenan en una serie de trastornos que transforman al individuo en un ser antisocial es como en venganza ante su incapacidad por desarrollarse plenamente a nivel sexual aunque existe un componente de carencias afectivas a nivel familiar que tambi n inducen al individuo a transformarse en un ser mal fico

4391778 this series of mark making tools is based on the notion that marks and stains give suggestions of what has been and thus give a life and history to an object

4391780 the porcelain inkwells are stained with ink and in time will change with use

4391788 vorgesehen ist die beschaffung von 9 maschinen durch die lufthansa im verlauf der n chsten zwei jahre
4391789 die lufthansa entscheidet was ben tigt wird und vermarktet das produkt wir sind der betreiber
4391790 unser ziel ist es neben den 9 flugzeugen der lufthansa privatjetflotte bis ende 2010 noch etwa 10 maschinen von dritten unter vertrag nehmen zu k nnen

4391799 die deutsche wirtschaft ist heute deutlich besser aufgestellt und robuster als beim letzten abschwung 2001 das liegt an der deutlichen verbesserung der wettbewerbsf higkeit zum beispiel durch die vern nftige lohnpolitik die steuerreformen und die reformen am arbeitsmarkt
4391800 links should be to the specific piece of information being mentioned
4391801 this sort of deep linking makes it easy for the user who will come to trust you as the most authoritative source of information on a topic
4391802 bear in mind that if you had to register for a site in order to see the information the user will have to do the same so provide instructions
4391803 decide a consistent style for the display of links commonly grouped together at the bottom of the story or elsewhere on the page
4391804 the advantage is that users easily identify with the context of the link because the word or words are highlighted and underlined
4391805 the disadvantage to this approach is that users unaccustomed to online may find it a halting experience to click onto a new window part way through an article

4391827 sadly again in the last few days there have been a number of suspected heroin overdoses
4391828 to our knowledge there have been eight since august 10 and sadly four of those persons did not recover and died as a result

4391834 we thank the government for looking into the plight of the lower cadres in the civil service by giving them a pay rise
4391835 the distribution of this salary adjustment takes into account the disparities within job groups and the need to motivate staff in the lower and middle class the increase also takes into account the governments ability to pay within the current budgetary constraints
4391836 the implementation is the final salary award in the civil service within the harmonisation framework whose first phase was implemented with effect from july 1 2005

4391842 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4391843 we were surprised that copies of investigation files were given to the media the content of these files has been extensively reported it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4391844 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered
4391845 we have always believed that this heinous crime could be solved with the help of the public our investigators continue to explore credible leads and will continue to do so as long as madeleine is missing

4391862 i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given
4391863 nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4391864 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
4391865 i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person
4391866 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach

4391871 the proposed sale of our retail fuels marketing operations in brazil is consistent with our ongoing effort to concentrate downstream resources and capital on strategic global assets

4391878 it is an example of the devastation drugs can cause not only to users but to their friends and family and the court needs to mark the seriousness of this offence

4391880 it cant be open ended either geographically or in time
4391881 it has to be circumscribed and its got to be in the context of the russians withdrawing all their armed forces
4391882 if tomorrow president saakashvili signs these documents then the withdrawal of the russian troops can start
4391883 the japanese government should publicly apologize and put in history how the women were abducted and forced to serve in the comfort women system
4391884 we can never forget what they did to us until now its been a wound in our chest
4391885 triggered by your interest in images of child pornography you forcibly abused two girls in a wholly disgraceful manner which is bound to have caused substantial damage to them
4391886 you appear to have no or very little insight into the nature and consequences of your conduct nor have you shown remorse or regret
4391887 indeed at one stage after many years of abuse by you one of your victims summoned up the courage to tell someone about what happened you then successfully branded her as a liar and claimed she was suffering from a psychiatric condition
4391888 hes a menace and definitely the worst of the kids causing bother around here im glad hes got an asbo and he seems to be sticking to it for now sitting out on his chair for his friends to come and see him i hope it lasts but im not sure
4391889 behaviour of this nature is totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated we have made every effort to persuade this individual to change his behaviour using abcs because of his young age and offering assistance and support on numerous occasions however since he has chosen to disregard all support offered to him we had no choice but to seek an asbo against him
4391890 the aim is to give you the chance to show the court an advertisement d others that you are able to behave in an appropriate and acceptable way
4391891 you have pled guilty to a serious offence which could have had devastating consequences for your victim
4391892 only good fortune prevented even more serious injury to your victim
4391893 there are many reasons to consider that a custodial sentence should be imposed upon you today
4391894 for many years you have displayed violent and other unacceptable behaviour linked in part to excessive consumption of alcohol
4391895 once again excessive alcohol consumption was involved and it is clearly important you abstain from alcohol in future
4391896 i am prepared to give you a chance to show you can sustain the current improvement in your lifestyle attitude and behaviour and also allow all the people and agencies trying to help you to continue their work
4391897 which he states is a reminder of what happened and looks unsightly

4391903 as the weather is warmer and people are frequenting the parks again we all thought it would be a good idea to make people safer in our parks and show that saps jmpd and the new city parks rangers are all working together to make the parks a better place for everyone
4391904 crime comes and goes safety especially in parks is quite a collective effort
4391905 we are trying very hard to sustain safety at our parks but the community must also become more vigilant and involved

4391950 christs faithful have the right indeed at times the duty in keeping with their knowledge competence and position to manifest to the sacred pastors their views on matters which concern the good of the church they have the right also to make their views known to others of christs faithful but in doing so they must always respect the integrity of faith and morals show due reverence to the pastors and take into account both the common good and the dignity of individuals

4391956 beliau sengaja tidak membenarkan saya merujuk kepada banyak dokumen penting yang saya minta
4391957 ini jelas melanggar prinsip keadilan dan kebebasan maklumat seperti yang diperjuangkan oleh lim dan kerajaannya yang didakwa mengamalkan cat cekap bertanggungjawab dan telus
4391958 ini kerana maklumat minima seperti itu tidak membantu menambah apa yang saya sudah tahu mengenai keputusan keputusan mesyuarat exco kerajaan sebelumnya

4391968 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take

4391991 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4391992 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4391993 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4391994 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4391995 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4391996 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4391997 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4391998 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4391999 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4392000 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4392001 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4392002 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4392003 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4392004 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4392005 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4392006 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4392007 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4392008 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4392009 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4392010 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4392011 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4392012 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4392013 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4392014 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4392015 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4392016 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4392017 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4392018 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4392019 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4392020 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4392021 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4392022 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4392023 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4392024 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4392025 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4392026 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4392027 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4392028 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4392029 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4392030 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4392031 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4392032 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4392033 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4392034 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4392035 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream

4392038 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4392039 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4392040 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4392041 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4392042 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4392043 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home

4392046 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4392047 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4392048 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4392049 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4392050 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4392051 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4392052 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

4392061 their pride will be hurt coming into this division after being a premier league club and getting beat by doncaster
4392062 it would be very difficult to double the number of apprenticeships on offer if the government didnt make those changes but some of the changes will be in place by the end of this year
4392063 we sent a list of barriers to offering apprenticeships to skills secretary john denham
4392064 and hes already put processes in place to remove them
4392065 robinho has felt slightly ignored in some aspects but he is happy with his team mates and with schuster he loves madrid
4392066 president ram n calder n told us that he would not leave for 100m they are doing with robinho what manchester united have done with cristiano ronaldo
4392067 if he stays next tear he would be able to leave for a lot smaller fee than the 32m now on offer from chelsea

4392080 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4392081 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4392082 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4392083 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4392084 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4392085 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4392086 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4392087 god im not sure about you but i want you to show me
4392088 do you not yet understand that softness comes from strength and strength form softness
4392089 what is there to say bangkai san they wanted to rape her i put an end to their plans
4392090 that was a long time ago now bangkai san drink your tea
4392091 after you whacked all the baddies what did you do sensei
4392092 after that i took her to her family home she was due to marry the very next day and that was that
4392093 of course there was i am after all a man am i not
4392094 bangkai san why do you ask questions the answers to which you are not ready for
4392095 she is living somewhere in tokyo with her very successful and powerful husband
4392096 i guess its not easy to compete with such a man when we are but mere mortals right sensei
4392097 alright i still think you will not understand but i will try when you truly love someone never make the mistake of telling her so
4392098 by telling her so you only dilute the love that you feel for her dont you see by telling her you love her you are putting expectations upon your beloved how can there be true love when there are expectations
4392099 bangkai san when two hearts are one words will only get in the way though i have never told her she knows bangkai san she knows
4392100 but dont you ever miss her or anything like that sensei after all she is in tokyo with her husband and all and you here
4392101 bangkai san when another heart lives within yours space time and even circumstances loses all meaning someday you will understand this
4392102 bangkai san remember the girl i rescued the girl whom i sent to her family home so that she could be married the next day
4392103 if you must know bangkai san she is my beloved
4392104 all persons interviewed highly recommended him for a position of trust and responsibility
4392105 dreyfus urged republicans to open their doors to people who had too long been excluded from party affairs women minorities urban workers and students
4392106 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4392107 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4392108 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying
4392109 i notice that stress eating is something i do well
4392110 whatevers in the refrigerator is what gets put in the tank
4392111 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4392112 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4392113 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4392114 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4392115 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4392116 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4392117 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4392118 the knowledge that we can gain from studying the amazonian dark earths found throughout the amazon river region not only teaches us how to restore degraded soils triple crop yields and support a wide array of crops in regions with agriculturally poor soils but also can lead to technologies to sequester carbon in soil and prevent critical changes in world climate
4392119 the result is that about 50 percent of the biomass carbon is retained
4392120 by sequestering huge amounts of carbon this technique constitutes a much longer and significant sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide than most other sequestration options making it a powerful tool for long term mitigation of climate change in fact we have calculated that up to 12 percent of the carbon emissions produced by human activity could be offset annually if slash and burn were replaced by slash and char
4392121 the global importance of a bio char sequestration as a byproduct of the conversion of biomass to bio fuels is difficult to predict but is potentially very large
4392122 in other words producing and applying bio char to soil would not only dramatically improve soil and increase crop production but also could provide a novel approach to establishing a significant long term sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide
4392123 bruno glaser from the university of bayreuth has found that terra preta is rich in charcoal incompletely burnt wood

4392128 wer die wahrheit im falschen moment sagt gilt als zyniker
4392129 that suspect has already been sent to jakarta right now
4392130 we werent hit really bad until the last two weeks
4392131 there didnt seem to be many mosquitoes right up to a couple of weeks ago when all the rain started now theyre wicked
4392132 they hadnt been coming out until evening but they were awful today at midday
4392133 these record results are a fitting testament to the hard graft that students and teachers have put in over the last two years
4392134 the predictable dismissal of these achievements from the usual suspects is not helpful we need to support and encourage achievement rather than giving young adults an early lesson in the british tradition of knocking success
4392135 we must also remember the one in four students who havent taken any examinations and have left our education system without any qualifications the government must continue its efforts to open up educational opportunity to all
4392136 employers must also play their part in making our education reforms work rather than carping on about young people not being job ready employers should be offering more and better work experiences places and many more high quality apprenticeships
4392137 i wish each class would have a website where information could be posted so parents could read whats going on
4392138 i prefer face to face i love it when parents can come in
4392139 with the standardized reports that go home to really get a true picture of how your child is doing you need to talk to the teacher about it
4392140 my feeling is youre the expert on your child and im the expert on teaching your child so lets work together i love it when the kids can see us together and talking together because then they know its a team effort
4392141 i think people need to feel comfortable enough to pick up the phone and teachers need to understand that getting to the heart of issues early on is the key to helping students and parents work together
4392142 when you ask a grade 2 student to write down that information you struggle sometimes to decipher what they are trying to communicate
4392143 theres a sense with email that youre available 24 hours a day
4392144 i find it comforting to know parents have my email address so that if something comes up they can send me an email
4392145 but probably the most immediate way to get in touch with a teacher is to call
4392146 i teach students how to use it and if there are any students im concerned about i will contact the parent and make sure they know they can put notes in that
4392147 esto es algo muy especial es el resultado de la preparaci n f sica lo que nos permite acceder a un nivel superior
4392148 ahora voy a ganar mi pr xima carrera voy a buscar esa medalla de oro
4392149 todo empez el 19 de febrero del 2000 cuando fui al centro penal la reforma me dieron marihuana para que la llevara pero cuando me revisaron me dio miedo y le dije al guarda tome esto pero por favor no me haga nada
4392150 estoy muy arrepentida pero en aquel momento lo hice por hambre ten a tres ni as peque as y yo deb a alimentarlas nadie me ayudaba me iban a dar un diario
4392151 los jueces me dejaron en libertad hasta que la sentencia quedara en firme y cuando eso sucedi el 27 de marzo del 2007 me fui a entregar

4392154 the sharp drop in short term rates over the past year should eventually end the current slump and spark a powerful market recovery
4392155 an increase in taxes on dividend income would likely hurt shares with high yields it would also encourage investors to move money instead into blue chip growth stocks
4392156 dont expect oil stocks to keep beating the rest of the market as they have done for most of the past five years do expect an eventual rebound in battered financial shares

4392168 hab a hablado de un acuerdo entre fracciones y el movimiento libertario no puso un voto para esta desconvocatoria a la fuerza
4392169 mi gol surgi en un cambio de frente mi compa ero el venezolano roberto rosales la baj de cabeza la bola me lleg picando yo la punti y un defensa sigui de largo entr al rea por el v rtice derecho y amagu me qued a la izquierda se la tir a lo largo al portero y entr me qued ronco y me fui a celebrar con el muchacho de seguridad
4392170 el rival es muy bueno puso tres delanteros y tuvo un juego muy directo con buenas acciones de pelota muerta y saques de banda muy peligrosos
4392171 el partido fue muy dif cil tuvimos bastantes ocasiones de gol y para suerte m a pude anotar el gol del triunfo el gane fue muy merecido pero debemos mejorar mucho en la definici n
4392172 la eliminatoria se nos complica por el gol que recibimos de visita pero la posibilidad de clasificar todav a est abierta
4392173 el equipo b lgaro llev el juego a paso lento sin arriesgar mucho nos hicieron el gol en un tiro de esquina nuestro t cnico lothar matthaeus se molest mucho por el descuido en el gol y algunas situaciones t cticas que no le gustaron

4392177 sin discriminar ni subsidiar y para que las tasas de inter s reflejen correctamente el costo de los recursos financieros
4392178 el aumento en las tasas que cobran los bancos por los pr stamos otorgados a sus clientes obedece al incremento que experimenta el costo del dinero captado por estos para realizar su labor de intermediaci n financiera

4392182 las mejores ideas terminan conduciendo al fracaso si no se cuenta con recursos presupuestarios y humanos para llevarlos adelante y el gobierno no tiene presupuesto suficiente para hacer frente a tareas que el pa s necesita urgentemente

4392220 i dont see how ontario is benefiting the way it used to when it was canadian owned
4392221 this is very similar to system access fees except that if anything its a clearer deception

4392224 we saw a 20 per cent retracement in the gold price back in 06 and weve seen a 20 per cent retracement this year its been volatile theres no doubt about it

4392232 the steady drum beat of double digit sales declines this year is beginning to weigh more heavily on prices
4392233 the provincial economy isnt exactly holding up too well so we certainly cant rule out a future price decrease in the toronto market
4392234 its not improbable since the trajectory is downward and the market is definitely past its prime
4392235 most likely due to the moderate economic growth and the increased choice in the resale market

4392266 when the gun shoots im just jittery its weird i dont know why im always nervous
4392267 i dont feel any aches any twitches or anything like that im just staying healthy and taking care of my body very well
4392268 theres no telling what can happen if you put all of us in a race
4392269 we could all run 10 0 because were so nervous you never know at the same time any conditions with us three guys i think the world record can go lower
4392270 its asking a lot to have someone run four races at that level in two days
4392271 thats not an easy thing to do when he hasnt raced in six weeks it does take a toll on an athlete theres a natural nervousness apprehension on all our parts about what the unknown is we believe hes 100 percent and its more this weekend will prove hes 100 percent
4392272 coming off my hamstring injury was a little bit scary for me especially mentally
4392273 athletes have a tendency to think they can do anything if its just a little hurt you can put some icyhot on it and get through it that wasnt the case for me
4392274 nah trust me youre all right just stay right here where you are and everythings going to work out all right
4392275 when usain bolt ran 9 72 i realized in order to beat him i have to run 9 6 most likely
4392276 thats what i trained my mind to do run 9 6 you just have to adapt to where people are going
4392277 a lot of things can go wrong in such a short period of time which is kind of funny
4392278 being around jon drummond you really try to be technically sound its about running in a straight line about reacting about running through the finish line anyone can do things wrong in the 100 meters and still run fast thats what is so amazing about usain and when records get broken early in the season
4392279 i dont take anybody for granted because anybody can run fast any time youve got to be prepared at all times
4392280 i dont really mind if people say that im the favorite or im the underdog
4392281 a lot of people are still looking forward to me doing big things regardless of the hamstring injury anyone could be the favorite right now its just about handling the pressure
4392282 one of the charges for zarganar was causing disaffection on to the state and the government by appearing on the websites of burmese exiled media such as mizzima and the irrawaddy and providing them with pictures
4392283 i use to feel the same as mothers when their sons are met with same fate now its my son and i am numb with these feelings what my son did was for the sake of the country irrespective of how many counts they charge him with
4392284 cast a shadow over our efforts to normalise ties with pakistan
4392285 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4392286 we have intelligence inputs about extremist groups planning to target prominent leaders and symbols of national importance
4392287 i had to walk many miles to a school i had to study at night in the dim light of a kerosene light
4392288 ich bin nicht berrascht dass sebastian sebastian vettel anm d red eine chance in der formel 1 bekommen hat aber er h tte nicht vor mir dort sein d rfen
4392289 man kann einfach nicht leugnen dass in diesem gesch ft reichlich politik gemacht wird
4392290 ich bin noch jung aber um ehrlich zu sein kann ich nicht ewig hier herumh ngen wenn ich mir einen platz in der formel 1 verdienen will
4392291 wenn ich im alter von 25 jahren nicht dort angekommen bin dann bin realistisch genug um zu sehen dass mein traum geplatzt ist
4392292 es gibt hunderte von youngsters die alles daf r geben an die spitze zu kommen da wird dir sicherlich niemand geschenke machen ich muss die dtm gewinnen und es gibt keinen grund zu glauben dass ich das nicht packen k nnte
4392293 es war ein guter start aber ich denke dass ich noch schneller fahren kann
4392294 die gripverh ltnisse sind heute sehr wechselhaft aber es ist okay ich bin gut gefahren und habe keine fehler gemacht das war nicht schlecht f r die erste pr fung
4392295 martin vor welche schwierigkeiten stellt eine strecke wie valencia ihren rennstall
4392296 was das setup anbelangt so m ssen wir uns wie bei monaco bewusst sein dass der kurs am ersten trainingstag sowohl gr n als auch recht staubig sein wird das verleitet einem manchmal dazu mehr mit dem setup herumzuspielen als unbedingt n tig
4392297 man muss dieser versuchung also widerstehen und die strecke auf das auto wirken lassen unsere simulationen haben ergeben dass wir ein hnliches abtriebslevel wie in hockenheim brauchen werden aber die individuellen eigenheiten dieser rennstrecke werden dieses fenster nach oben oder untern erweitern
4392298 letztendlich wird auch jeder sich im klaren dar ber sein dass die mauern in gewissen streckenteilen sehr nahe an der strecke verlaufen wenn man sich die videobilder des kurses n her angeschaut hat wir werden nat rlich jede menge ersatzteile dabei haben hoffen aber nicht dass wir sie brauchen werden
4392299 wie bereitet sich das team darauf vor eine strecke erstmals zu besuchen
4392300 die wichtigsten elemente dabei sind gr ndlichkeit methode und wiederholung
4392301 allerdings m ssen wir dort den feedbacks unserer fahrer und den daten unseres autos erh hte aufmerksamkeit zukommen lassen ganz wichtig man darf nicht allzu hastig reagieren es ist von gro er bedeutung sich nicht zu verrennen denn die zeit f r das feintuning vor dem qualifying ist begrenzt
4392302 spanien ist in den vergangenen f nf jahren offensichtlich zu einem unglaublich guten markt f r die formel 1 geworden und die hinzuf gung eines zweiten spanischen grand prix zum rennkalender spiegelt ganz klar den erfolg des sports und die popularit t wider
4392303 wir haben dort im vergangenen jahr unser team vorgestellt und die stadt war ein atemberaubender backround f r diese veranstaltung alles was wir bislang von der stadt und den organisatoren des events gesehen haben bringt mich zu dem gedanken dass es eine fantastische erfolgsgeschichte und ein neuer standard f r die formel 1 werden wird
4392304 viel wichtiger ist aber dass es eine r ckkehr zum stadtrennen bedeutet das ist etwas was wir auch in singapur oder abu dhabi erleben werden das rei t die fans nun einmal noch mehr mit als eine strecke au erhalb der stadt f r das wachstum des sports ist das eine gro e sache und jeder bei mclaren mercedes hofft auf ein erfolgreiches wochenende sowohl f r das team als auch f r den sport
4392305 people viewed the commodity headwinds as just so severe that any time you get a pullback in the commodities the market will try to make some headway
4392306 this market that were in it was led down by the financials so now were going to have to see it led back out of this morass by the financials as well
4392307 i think were certainly in that trend now its starting to have positive tones under the market
4392308 the greater fear right now is missing the next big rally said richard dickson senior analyst at lowry research in florida
4392309 inflation numbers were bad but they are probably going to get better the fact that the market has not sold off with any strength investors are saying hey lets go ahead and buy
4392310 there has been a sufficient amount of pessimism to warrant a short term rally

4392314 it was not as fast as i wanted to but that is down to a lack of hurdles races really
4392315 but i have got that one out of the way the hurdles is always a bit nerve wracking but then you can settle in for the high jump its an okay starting point
4392316 it feels good it is my first time in the olympic games so it was all a bit nerve wracking especially being in with asafa powell
4392317 i had a good finish but i would like to be up there at 20 and 30 metres as well so hopefully i can go out and do it in the quarter final
4392318 i have run 10 21 which is my second best time of the season its good but there is more to come
4392319 i got a bit nervous it is my first olympics heat winner doesnt mean nothing and the time doesnt mean nothing it is all about the final i am just happy to get by
4392320 i think this is a good start im gonna come back and give it large tonight
4392321 1 59 is much better for me it will get faster but i dont mind the faster the better i took a few knocks out there but showed my robustness
4392322 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4392323 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4392324 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4392325 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4392326 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4392327 all persons interviewed highly recommended him for a position of trust and responsibility
4392328 dreyfus urged republicans to open their doors to people who had too long been excluded from party affairs women minorities urban workers and students
4392329 im still chasing him i have three more finals to beat him
4392330 i saw it every single day and that gave me the extra motivation that made a little bit of a difference just having it and being able to see it in my room
4392331 i thought maybe in a few months i can have one of these of my own
4392332 its a feeling that i dont think any father can describe
4392333 all the injuries tears everything pays off this very moment you can only think of good things now
4392334 the more attention shooting gets the better im known for a lot of things whether its this his wife or the other wrong target it doesnt matter to me
4392335 anyone happy in their personal a definite help and a positive thing
4392336 i wouldnt trade having katie by my side for anything in the world
4392337 its very difficult when one of us is competing to keep your mind on your own game
4392338 the past few days have been a roller coaster ride for both of us
4392339 i like roller coasters with katie winning two medals weve had a lot of things to do
4392340 my family was adamantly opposed to my becoming a weightlifter

4392478 the ohio democratic party will fight back aggressively against these shameless attempts by the republican party to intimidate voters deceive them about the elections process and repress voter turnout in this historic election year
4392479 our hope is that everyone will take a step back and work together in voters best interests to find solutions to these questions rather than fight it out with press releases and lawsuits public squabbling just leads to voter confusion

4392496 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4392497 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

4392505 michael sudah kembali berlatih tapi sejujurnya saya pikir bermain di partai versus manchester united akan terlalu dini

4392508 many companies showed immense interest in the construction of a theme park in halkal during our talks with the managers of these companies in the united states
4392509 we are set to make a tender within a week
4392510 tok is constructing 25 000 houses in halkal and we need to launch different projects so as to sell these houses at a good price
4392511 in the aftermath we bought the land and we will construct a giant amusement center in the area and we will call for bids within one week
4392512 we also continue to work on the theme park project in ankaras ball kuyumcu district
4392513 in fact construction of a theme park in ankara was one of my first priorities but clients showed greater interest in investing in a project in istanbul
4392514 i have neither concern nor luxury to reach an agreement with a certain party we will make the tender for the land the company that attends the auction and offers the highest bid will purchase the land if no investors make an offer for the land in question we will accept the situation since we will not give a public property to a company for free
4392515 i have talked to the representatives of world bank in the u s
4392516 the world bank will give 1 billion credit to tok but a treasury guarantee is obligatory for the use of the credit were working on it
4392517 world bank representatives are extremely willing to give credit to tok
4392518 we will use world banks credits for urban transformation and social housing projects

4392535 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4392536 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4392537 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4392538 to show russia that we can come to the aid of a european ally and that we can do it at will whenever and wherever we want
4392539 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it

4392599 you were proud to be a democrat in this state under his leadership
4392600 arkansas is going to miss his leadership certainly democrats will hes a force were not going to have moving forward
4392601 certainly politics will be suspended for awhile i hope there wont be any posturing there is a place to be human and a place to be partisan its time to be human right now
4392602 he was a very honest man and if we were on the opposite side of an issue you knew it from the start he didnt try to mask anything im like that too and i think he recognized that in me
4392603 he was a loyal party leader in a job that was really difficult
4392604 he was also extremely solid and wasnt one of those people who would tell you they were supporting something one day and change their mind the next whether win lose or draw it didnt matter to him
4392605 he was really smart a little arrogant people might have thought that but he was very smart and very confident i can assure you he was a hell of an adversary he was probably former governor mike huckabees number one antagonist
4392606 senseless act of depraved violence that touches all of us
4392607 he was a very effective leader for his party and an event like this certainly makes all politics seem small and insignificant
4392608 he came from an upper income family but his heart and soul was with the common everyday people and what was good for the citizen
4392609 he had a phenomenal moral compass to know what was right and wrong he didnt need a poll to make a stand on an issue even those that were sometimes controversial
4392610 he wasnt bashful unlike some people who sometimes measure their words
4392611 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side
4392612 you could already see the party taking on a new aura about it he was bringing new life to it
4392613 its going to be a tough couple of weeks and i think the convention is going to be difficult

4392659 and we need to be there and we need to weigh in on issues of importance to the city and importance to the company water issues educational issues economic development issues and we just couldnt stay here on our 286 acres and just let the world go by

4392661 san antonio is the perfect place for us to be
4392662 but i do recognize that were moving up the ladder and people are worried about ok what about the 14 thousand 15 thousand people who work at usaa are they going to lose their job because were going to shut the place down and move to pheonix or chicago or dallas or wherever
4392663 the answer is there is no and i say this from the bottom of my heart and as honestly as i can there is no plan underfoot nor are we studying any alternatives to move the headquarters or usaa from san antonio texas

4392669 when you win everyone gets credit so everyone is responsible for losing everyone has to do more from this point on everyone needs to do a better job
4392670 when i made comments about playing overseas people took it out of perspective thought i was talking about leaving while still playing for the knicks it was turned into something negative about going to italy now it seems its ok

4392674 we had an extended amount of time here where we tried to improve his situation it didnt seem like we were getting very far it was very unfortunate
4392675 he was anxious to really start his career over and we thought this was the right situation we worked him out he was in outstanding shape we didnt think there was going to be any down time whatsoever we wished him well and hopefully hell get himself back to where he feels good about having an opportunity

4392680 jerry said what he said so i think it will happen
4392681 especially with the injury i had last year its kind of made it a little more unstable the orthotics are basically trying to stabilize my foot
4392682 my feet are not in the same position theyve been in for the first 30 years of my life
4392683 its kind of putting them in a new position and theyre not comfortable with it theyre sore i think ill be all right its just about me getting used to em
4392684 i knew it was time to get up and go to work
4392685 its been a lot of hard work but the biggest part that goes into it is the translation of the information of the words and phrases the plays are all the same most teams run the same type of plays its just what you call them hes definitely making progress
4392686 he knows the plays they just dont come off his tongue as easily because hes been doing it one way for so many years and now its new hes definitely making progress
4392687 ill be a lot further along than i was last year the more i rest the more i take care of my ankle ill be close to 100 if im not 100 ill probably be 95 96 which ill definitely take
4392688 it was the first time i actually ran and played on them
4392689 its going to take some time for me to get used to it once i get past that stage i think ill be out here from there
4392690 my feet are not in the same position that theyve been in for the first 30 years of my life so theyre not comfortable with it
4392691 theyre sore but i think ill be all right its just about me getting used to them
4392692 i know theres going to be times where i go out and jam it a few times or get tackled or things like that
4392693 i know thats going to happen im just trying to prevent those things from happening by getting it as strong as i can get it and me just getting back to being myself
4392694 hes fatigued im fatigued receiver david clowney who left the afternoon practice wednesday was fatigued
4392695 its training camp its a hard transition you go from vacation to hitting people and running around tons of meetings its not your normal day at the office you have to get through that and eventually get into a normal routine and the body adjusts its training camp
4392696 he goes im a little bit fatigued and i said yeah youre old
4392697 theres been a lot of things that hes had to get acclimated to whether its finding the lunchroom or learning the playbook or studying film and all that stuff hes doing a really really good job im very pleased
4392698 so we take the information and put it in the form of a crossword puzzle and give him that there are a lot of different avenues
4392699 when you get a guy in here a little bit late it definitely adds some hours
4392700 but its been fun its been a fun transition its been a lot of hard work the biggest part that goes into it is just the translation of the information of the words and phrases
4392701 the plays are all the same most teams run the same type of plays
4392702 its just what you call them hes really doing a good job picking it up we have a number of guys on the staff and on the team that actually have been in the system that he comes from so you hear a lot of translating going on
4392703 bubbas the guy that actually can translate the best from anybody because he was just there with brett in green bay
4392704 the system that he comes from has been branched off in different areas so bubba definitely helps hes one of the players who can help translate for brett
4392705 a lot of playing the position is you see something and react
4392706 hes always had a good feel for solving problems and again he might not be able to put it into our terminology but he knows i have a problem over there i am going to bail myself out over here
4392707 hes like a lot of young guys they lose their confidence
4392708 how fast can you come back from that i think hes starting to have a little success i think hes starting to understand what tom coughlin wants from the quarterback position if we can keep him in rhythm keep him balanced and not be in a hurry to rush from the pocket i think he will be fine
4392709 the last year i was with him he threw for 3 500 yards and the next year when gary kubiak had him he completed 68 percent of his passes
4392710 pro athletes have very fragile egos so we just have to try to get them in stride build their confidence get them to believe in themselves and to believe in the system i think thats how you get a guy back going in the right direction
4392711 he has such a strong arm he has so much torque in his body when he gets it out there but at some point that torque is going to start to tighten up on him and he is going to have trouble throwing the ball
4392712 kellen is going to be the no 2 quarterback this week
4392713 as brett improves and makes progress he gets more reps its kellens job right now and weve got to see how the rest of camp goes hes done some things ive really liked
4392714 you didnt think fat people could move this fast did you
4392715 youre just trying to learn whats going on and where to be at
4392716 its a little frustrating but its what you go through when you first start out everybody can relate to that
4392717 when i first came it was more wow we have to know this we have to remember this we have to remember to do that
4392718 now its more what was this on this play as opposed to not knowing anything
4392719 my biggest thing is always knowing where you need to be knowing whats going on
4392720 from there you can get the job accomplished its not necessarily easy to go out there and play hard but if you go out there and not know what youre doing you may accidentally make a couple of plays you may accidentally give up some plays more likely youll give up more than you make my thing is if i know what im doing know where im supposed to be hopefully i wont give up too many at all
4392721 it was a little rough i was a little nervous wasnt sure of plays
4392722 now i had a chance to get into the playbook a little bit more i obviously got that first experience out of the way so hopefully i will be a little more comfortable out there
4392723 theres been some times where you see the pass rush ability the raw power
4392724 hes got very strong hands hes got a great ability to control the line of scrimmage and those traits just naturally come out especially in a one on one drill or something where its less processing but you want to see it translate into the game and into the practices it will come
4392725 i started out late but thats something i couldnt control
4392726 once i got here i was focused on what im doing doing some extra meetings doing some extra things on the field and im getting up to speed
4392727 i think the longer he goes and the more comfortable he gets with the system i think hes going to be fine
4392728 we think hes going to be a good football player and hes shown at different times that he can help us we just need to keep trying to speed up his indoctrination hes worked hard at it hes spent a lot of time after practice both on the field and in the classroom to try to catch up
4392729 now brett could be different he has been different his whole life but i think they are long odds at age 39 to take this team to the playoffs said espn analyst and former eagle qb ron jaworski
4392730 he is going to have to try and learn this system in three weeks and its just not going to happen jaworski said
4392731 it is going to be very limited at least for the first quarter of the season the other thing that comes into play is the comfort level of his receiving corps it takes time to develop that chemistry
4392732 thats a tough one for eric to answer because clearly brett is going to need the work in the system jaworski said
4392733 he doesnt need the experience on the field he has that but its a matter of playing with these offensive lineman and wide receivers
4392734 the packers relied on favre last year and the jets saw a guy who could put a team on his back offensively and carry them jaworski said
4392735 two things not being able to throw strikes and kind of babying it a little and still being worried about re injuring it
4392736 there are still baby steps to be made but i feel good about tonight
4392737 you have to at some point evaluate him in that situation versus a 12 0 game
4392738 you still have to feel as though we have a team that can win we feel that way but i know we havent shown it at times
4392739 we have 40 games left so its out there for the taking
4392740 weve got six more with boston and six more with tampa bay and tampa bay just had some big injuries its there for us if we go out and play well see what we can make out of this race
4392741 we would have loved to have played better but we didnt
4392742 weve dug ourselves a hole and now we have to work our way out of it to be honest when we get to friday im not going to be thinking about what happened on the road trip
4392743 i know weve had a lot of issues but everybody else has too
4392744 sometimes when it doesnt go your way what can you do about it
4392745 you just have to come in and try to work it out thats what were doing
4392746 thats been or weakness we havent been able to play well against the teams below 500
4392747 i was just running hard because i dont hit enough home runs to know whether it was a home run or not
4392748 unless i hear something different for him his side or how hes throwing then well take the extra step but the good thing about his situation is that we have brian stokes there hes stretched out we feel very comfortable that he could fill in that spot
4392749 you talk to any player after the first couple days its a hard transition the players that were here early go from vacation to hitting people running around tons of meetings thats not your normal day at the office
4392750 its one big open chatfest when we get together and its nice its nice to have that peer that i can just sit back and open up with
4392751 hes got a very good feel for whats going on both offensively and defensively the gunslinger tag is maybe a little unfair because hes got a great feel for whats going on
4392752 i had to go back and review some of the things from my background in the west coast system but really not much other than being excited about getting him here and just working through the language issues
4392753 hes picking up everything that were asking him to do
4392754 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down
4392755 ive got just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
4392756 i would never want to put a quarterback in a position where they werent comfortable with plays
4392757 a lot of that has to do with us just sitting down as a staff with brett and the other guys theres definitely some give and take and that would be no different with any player but when you have a new player there might be a little more conversation about that and how it translates
4392758 most of the things were running are plays that hes run before its just getting him to be comfortable if we call it this they the packers called it that
4392759 im very proud of him hes done a really really good job with something thats not easy
4392760 well talk about it at the end of the year
4392761 we were worried about where he was over the rubber where the hands were breaking over the front leg and if theyre breaking at the same place then they should go into the same slot
4392762 right now every time i get the ball im just thinking about helping my team
4392763 on thursday we carried a report headlined miscarriage news is false says mehta wed heard the previous morning that mrs mehta who was refused permission by the high court to medically terminate her 24 25 week foetus had a miscarriage but when we called her husband to confirm the news he flatly denied it he told our reporter is at home and tutoring students her health is alright by and large but she has put on a lot of weight as journalists we tend not to take denials at face value we continue to poke around till weve got the full story but we let our guard down with the mehtas we believed mehta when he said there was no truth to the news of his wifes miscarriage we didnt think to probe further also because of the trauma they had gone through we were extremely conscious of not intruding on their privacy it now transpires that our original information was correct and that she had indeed miscarried on tuesday night strangely even their gynaecologist was not informed of the miscarriage
4392764 that was big for us it was good to see he had that type of command and got big outs
4392765 teams that are not quite in the race are looking to knock you out so theres incentive on both sides it doesnt matter who you beat this time of year youve got to put ws in the column
4392766 we need to make sure that georgias transportation infrastructure is open is not restricted by russian ships in the black sea or russian armour in poti port or near gori
4392767 its just bizarre that naval forces are blockading a sovereign independent country
4392768 i cant imagine how anyone who is sane could think that could be acceptable or reasonable
4392769 i cant imagine how there could be any russian peacekeepers in the conflict zones
4392770 the mission here is to inform the american people what is happening and what russia is doing
4392771 its a tragedy for us russia is spreading its borders
4392772 they had to turn back when they reached gori there were too many explosions and bombings
4392773 they are scared because they dont know if they will have enough food and they are scared that russians tanks will enter tbilisi

4392823 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4392824 the matter is now before the constitutional court we will await the ruling from the constitutional court before we close the shelters
4392825 but remember most of the people who are in the shelters do not have any legal status in the country and the constitutional court will not rule on their legality it is merely a decision on whether it would grant an interdict against the closures
4392826 whether today or another today they will be dealt with home affairs would have to decide on the matter
4392827 there was a meeting at the constitutional court today thursday between all the parties and we hope and expect the directions will come out very soon

4392849 without the awesome gaming in indonesia studies of scully hussar this area would never have reached popular society now we can truly dig out the truths and realities of the gaming in indonesia world around us and develop more reliable and sound conclusions thousands of heads are better than a few
4392850 i first read it online and was turned on that i went out and bought the book now im a true fan of gaming in indonesia studies and research i find the subject to be extremely interesting and thought provoking and reminiscent of the free thought era in the late 60s and early 70s
4392851 the highest usage areas in our library now are the public computers with internet access although most of the time the crowd is younger and usually communicating with friends some older notable gaming in indonesia researchers will come in and go straight for internet completely ignoring the card catalog
4392852 i like the internet because it is very transparent and available to all
4392853 but at the same time there is no authoritave body that can assign some sort of approval rating to truly legitimate works and those spun by unqualified authors
4392854 im happy to see that young people are interested in our gaming in indonesia studies
4392855 the internet has piqued the interest of our youth and has given them unparalled access to all knowledge academic and secular
4392856 when i published my work it would take a couple years to circulate the academic community and public now with the internet i can write and publish instantly casual readers and researchers alike can review my work as i write it
4392857 facsimiles of most gaming in indonesia articles can be made although most research centers charge a nominal fee for such reproductions
4392858 one out of four americans needs this gaming in indonesia in their households

4392888 and your point is what nobody said it was proof that all layers everywhere at all times in earths history have formed quickly what i have been saying over and over and over which apparently took you two weeks to figure out is that these layers had to have formed quickly you cannot have a living tree or a dead tree taking millions of years to be buried in a vertical position by horizontal layers is that so difficult why the straw man argument now now that you realize the problem with polystrate trees and the problem with carbon dating perhaps we can advance beyond kindergarten and explain to you that all of the radiometric dating schemes operate in open systems are seriously flawed and not reliable for dating the age of the earth obviously if the trees do not represent millions of years of sedimentation neither do the fossils found in the same layers represent millions of years of evolution rather what you see is the sequence in which things were rapidly buried
4392889 i am going back to being an old school politician and you can read what i think in the newspapers
4392890 there was a time not so long ago when i used to enjoy rushing to this blog and reading comments i used to look forward to pitting my wits against people who i didnt necessarily agree with but who could argue a point on its merit sure they didnt like me and would not trust me further than they could throw me but they had the maturity and self confidence to listen
4392891 last night as i finished my last post i realised that i was filled with dread at the heap of personal abuse i was expecting when i logged on this morning and i was not wrong
4392892 so after almost 42 posts from me and more than 900 comments from all of you i am signing off and i will not be coming back
4392893 those of you who made this blog what it was i thank you those of you who made this blog what it is i thank you too

4392897 during this period a lot of people buy flags but do not follow the proper flag code the tricolour can unite people and it is essential that we do not dishonour it
4392898 sometimes i even complain to the police if people dont listen to me it upsets me that people take no pride in the tricolour i get even more dejected when i see educated people insulting it
4392899 some petrol pumps were using flags for decoration something that is not allowed in the flag code i wrote about it to the petroleum minister it has been stopped since

4392905 theres a reason why we tell mothers to remain calm during pregnancy the foetus can hear and feel whatever the parent is doing and can be a reason for future family conflicts very often we have teenagers who have been told by their relatives that their mothers didnt want them at the time of pregnancy and this can give rise to serious issues
4392906 of course we cant say anything in niketas case but if a mother emotionally rejects a child it can lead to complications that can even be fatal
4392907 what they really need right now is some alone time and good counsel
4392908 after sustained interrogations of people arrested with fake currency we discovered that fake currency is being pumped into real estate particularly second and third rung builders and contractors and into bollywood and the share market
4392909 these sectors are volatile and need huge amounts of fast cash at regular intervals
4392910 the new crop of fake currency notes appears almost genuine
4392911 money lenders often mix several fake notes with genuine ones thereby duping borrowers
4392912 sie befinden sich in sicherer obhut und werden medizinisch betreut
4392913 die beiden sind k rperlich unversehrt es geht ihnen den umst nden entsprechend gut

4392920 cada d a sean m s ciudadanos los que respalden este proyecto

4392922 lo que hay que hacer ahora es dejarla en paz
4392923 se ha convertido en una carga para la sociedad vasca
4392924 s lo ser n tiles si tenemos muchos esca os
4392925 por lo tanto s lo hay una posibilidad para que los vascos puedan ver otro lehendakari que el pp tenga muchos esca os y el partido socialista tenga un poco de miedo al pp si no reeditar n cosas como la que han hecho en getxo dejando que haya un alcalde del pnv o en lava regalando la diputaci n al pnv
4392926 no quedan moderados o no pintan nada y quien manda es ibarretxe
4392927 yo creo que no se puede esperar ning n tipo de regeneraci n en el pnv ning n tipo de giro hacia el centro ning n tipo de pol tica m s sensata mientras ibarretxe siga en el gobierno
4392928 si a ese acuerdo se sumase el gobierno vasco ser a la clave para conseguir vivir en un pa s en paz y libertad pero yo s que el pnv va en una l nea absolutamente contraria a esto y por tanto mi propuesta es que cambiemos al gobierno vasco
4392929 we knew anecdotally from speaking with students and from researching internet blogs and websites that college students mix energy drinks and alcohol in order to drink more and to drink longer but we were surprised that the risk of serious and potentially deadly consequences was so much higher for those who mixed energy drinks with alcohol even when we adjusted for the amount of alcohol
4392930 only the symptoms of drunkenness are reduced but not the drunkenness they cant tell if theyre drunk they cant tell if someone else is drunk so they get hurt or they hurt someone else
4392931 drinking energy drinks can reduce the relaxing effect of alcohol which may lead to drinking more alcohol than one might normally drink also the caffeine in energy drinks is dehydrating which may slow down the metabolism of alcohol in the body
4392932 but we were surprised that the risk of serious and potentially deadly consequences was so much higher for those who mixed energy drinks with alcohol even when we adjusted for the amount of alcohol

4392938 but we always think the best ingredients makes the best food we do 90 per cent of our shopping at the big carrot on the danforth in our mind we wanted use the best organic ingredients to make the best clothing we just think its the way it should be done
4392939 a lot of people say the line really translates into us
4392940 were going to be using an organic cotton and recycled polyester blend
4392941 we never met here and we also never met in new york when we were both living there even though her roommate was a close family friend
4392942 i close my door lean back in my chair put my feet up and for 20 minutes im out
4392943 were misguided in our lack of naps and in this our society is driven by economy and not biology weve gotten rid of naps even though theyre good for us but that idea is coming back
4392944 some companies are starting to realize the benefits to cognitive abilities and how we get those with naps
4392945 we know theres something fundamental that happens and that a nap is just a part of full sleep weve hypothesized that theres something about deep sleep that allows the cells in the brain to reorganize
4392946 theres an intuitive part of it if it feels good after you nap then its good for you
4392947 we used to do it here in north america its part of the farming culture
4392948 i grew up on a farm outside of peterborough and everyone kind of had a nap after a big lunch
4392949 we all know about it think about the picture of the person with their belt buckle undone after a meal relaxing on the couch with their eyes closed
4392950 if you look at recent literature there is a global phenomenon that people are getting less sleep than 50 years ago
4392951 research shows that when youre behind the wheel a nights sleep deprivation impairs you to the same level as being legally drunk
4392952 i am a single girl with not one but two engagement rings and no fianc
4392953 i was with my ex for six years and on our fifth year anniversary he proposed with a tiffany solitare
4392954 maybe it was bratty of me but i disliked the ring because it was not what i imagined
4392955 id had a wedding set for about nine years and i didnt know what to do with it pawnshops seemed kind of creepy it didnt seem very respectful so i was talking to my stepmom over dinner and we laughed about the idea of a site called exboyfriendjewelry com then later we decided to do it
4392956 for me with my wedding set i just wanted it gone
4392957 its not so much about the money as it is getting it out of your life
4392958 this is an incredible neighbourhood i think its one of the most progressive in the city if not the most
4392959 you can get in this small area probably more varieties of food than you can get in any other area of the city
4392960 that for me in a nutshell is what the struggle is in the market right now
4392961 when it first moved in i thought how is a store that strictly sells japanese products going to survive
4392962 if you go to the market and you say vegan in most stores people know what it is
4392963 especially when you go for late night chinese food at e pan the quality is always amazing
4392964 its got a patio outside and its always overflowing with people
4392965 which is very inconspicuous it just has the brown awning out front
4392966 its funny considering how expensive rent is that there is empty space
4392967 i dont know if this is private property but no one ever says anything they just leave it as an open laneway for everyone to walk through
4392968 its funny for an area that promotes green living there is very little green space
4392969 not only does the crime of conspiracy exist in japanese law the elements required to prove a conspiracy under japanese law and california law are practically if not virtually identical
4392970 i am not going to give up the dream of both koreas living well together
4392971 which is the source of distrust and conflict has to be eliminated completely
4392972 i have expectations that north korea will come forward for comprehensive dialogue and economic cooperation because now is the most opportune time for the north to make change
4392973 i visited the shrine because i hope those who contributed their lives in the past wars would rest in peace
4392974 we pledge to lead the world as a peaceful and harmonious country and to work proactively toward establishing permanent world peace
4392975 minutes after i passed the resting spot i heard a big explosion i turned my head and saw big flames
4392976 we rushed to the scene and saw charred bodies while wounded people were crying for help pots and burned prayer rugs were scattered all over the place
4392977 seconds later i saw fire and flaying pieces of flesh
4392978 i fell down and i was able to see one of my legs bleeding people were running in all directions
4392979 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4392980 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4392981 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4392982 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4392983 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4392984 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4392985 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4392986 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4392999 sadly again in the last few days there have been a number of suspected heroin overdoses
4393000 to our knowledge there have been eight since august 10 and sadly four of those persons did not recover and died as a result
4393001 it could be there is a harmful item in it that has reacted to them or it could be the quality of the heroin
4393002 it was so much fun because the public were here you could feel the energy
4393003 it was a terrorist attack with a bomb in the towns main street
4393004 it is very sad because people were celebrating when the bomb exploded
4393005 these were the villages where we built swimming pools amusement parks schools hospitals lots of other things beautiful department stores to show the benefits of peace
4393006 they the russians came in and ethnically purified ethnically cleansed two areas of georgia they partially cleansed abkhazia and totally cleansed south ossetia
4393007 russian tanks are going for villages inhabited by georgian populations and throwing people out of their houses putting people into concentration camps that they are setting up in those villages and separating men and women

4393014 we will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4393015 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4393016 however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4393017 the main push has been a firmer us dollar across the board as well as weaker commodities
4393018 the us is not out of the woods but seems to be improving compared to the rest of the world
4393019 thats why the sentiment towards the us dollar has changed
4393020 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4393021 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution
4393022 this is a very important industry for the future of australia for the public interest and for the national interest
4393023 we need to find ways to assist the industry to begin
4393024 we feel that in the longer term situation that governments will become responsible anyway
4393025 australias energy security depends on us balancing australias oil and gas exploration and production capacity with our capacity to capture and store greenhouse gases
4393026 het is helder dat mijn directe kennis beperkt is ik zal me echt moeten inwerken maar participatie is een vraagstuk waar groenlinks duidelijke standpunten over heeft en er ligt veel beleid op de plank ik zal daar ook niet veel aan toevoegen
4393027 daar wilden we zekerheid over orhan kaya had geen bestuurlijke ervaring en was daardoor heel kwetsbaar
4393028 eind mei hoorden we ineens dat de bussen er zouden blijven rijden omdat er na de herinrichting van de bergse dorpsstraat geen bussen meer door mogen zegt bewoonster janine quispel boos
4393029 behalve dat onze huizen kapot trillen door die bussen levert het ook gevaarlijke situaties op
4393030 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4393031 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council
4393032 the resolution of kosovos status is covered by a u n security council resolution and that resolution envisions an international process so the two cases are totally different
4393033 for that reason we screen calls from the 203 area code
4393034 i dont like people who are rude to our waiters
4393035 some of the cdo and cds documents leave a lot to be desired and contain basic errors the fear is that as the courts get involved we are going to have some unpleasant surprises
4393036 now however the british capital is mired in as great a crisis as new yorks and things are about to get worse making a mockery of the insecurity complex regarding britain that hit u s business leaders just months ago
4393037 some people might be surprised to know that it is a crime to take plants from the countryside but these orchids are as much a part of our heritage as a painting in an art gallery and deserve protection too
4393038 the actions of the thieves have damaged a nationally important wildlife site and put a rare plant under threat
4393039 orchids are popular flowers but it is important that they are left to flourish in their natural environment in this case the limestone area of the white peak
4393040 its really important that all journalists are comfortable in front of a microphone or camera because the boundaries between print digital and broadcast are becoming so blurry
4393041 the opportunities here for journalists are summed up generally by the phrase this is the way the world is going
4393042 more and more companies and brands are realising that they must use new media formats it is fairly obvious that the written word is on the decline sadly and visual journalism is taking over
4393043 in the world of technology web video is very hot
4393044 and the big brands are desperate to be seen on stuff tv so we get to do a lot of cool stuff from flying with red bull stunt pilots to driving tanks
4393045 they have done the right thing and put their intentions in

4393053 and by the time i made the decision to transition my gender dissonance had gotten so bad that it completely consumed me it hurt more than any pain physical or emotional that i had ever experienced when i made the decision to transition i honestly had no idea what it would be like for me to live as female the only thing i knew for sure was that pretending to be male was slowly killing me

4393072 eight years ago when i first started that there would have made me nervous
4393073 its something you get used to over time you just roll with it
4393074 when theyre out of control and in danger of getting hurt or hurting someone else
4393075 when they get to turning too quick when they stop pulling and the sled starts pushing you run the risk of rolling them over
4393076 you have to be on your toes anything can break or go out of control
4393077 i watched as a kid and when i got older i pulled antique and farm stock tractors
4393078 i grew up on a farm and tractors just appeal to me
4393079 its part of the farming community its how disputes were settled
4393080 when youve got smoke coming out thats what you like
4393081 if you can drive it on the trailer at the end of the night its a good night
4393082 when you hook to the sled youre competitors but in the pit youre friends its good clean fun
4393083 for me its about the people youre with all the time you all have a good time win or lose
4393084 its fun i get to beat him and then he beats me
4393085 always a battle of red international and green john deere
4393086 for a while i didnt even have my own tractor
4393087 for me its a vacation you get out and see people its a contest like racing cars its fun to see what you can do
4393088 a lot of people dont realize a cell phone with no service provider will call 9 1 1
4393089 if youve got another call that is life threatening and a child keeps calling 9 1 1 it could be a major problem
4393090 while removing the batteries does cut down on the fun no beeps no lights it also eliminates the possibility of dialing 9 1 1

4393097 we have a target contribution in mind of 850 million
4393098 that will comprise 500 million from the rudd federal government
4393099 hes said today that he personally doesnt support the on and off ramps as part of the project but hes refusing to take it off the agenda
4393100 fortunately no one was seriously injured by these violent acts
4393101 however i fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt or even killed because of the research they perform or merely because they live in the same home as one of the targets
4393102 uc researchers and staff along with their spouses and children live in daily fear for their safety
4393103 the escalation of violence has grown at an alarming rate
4393104 you must be the best potato cook in the world i love these potatoes
4393105 thanks for getting the baby sitter lined up for tonight i want you to know that i dont take that for granted
4393106 were thrilled to be able to move forward with the site
4393107 in the absence of the type of public process we propose we believe that reuse planning might be mired in controversy undermining efforts to restore the hangar
4393108 we feel strongly that navys responsibilities for hangar one also include re covering the hangars structural steel skeleton
4393109 the time has come to look beyond the issue of re skinning and plan for the future reuse of the hangar
4393110 we have been told repeatedly by our representatives in washington that its hard to find money to preserve the hangar if there is no reuse plan
4393111 furthermore restoration and upgrading for reuse bathrooms lighting fire protection could be integrated into one construction project to save money
4393112 quite frankly the officers did an outstanding job in this case
4393113 the officers were operating on their experience and training and brought this to a successful resolution without injury to anyone
4393114 spread the word we will be enforcing this new law
4393115 we were being very focused on data and targeting students who needed the extra push
4393116 obesity is a huge problem within our society and among children
4393117 we just feel that banning one type of restaurant is not the answer to a healthy california
4393118 i happen to like the mcdonalds salads and i dont think we should be telling our residents where they can and cannot eat
4393119 nobody has any idea what fast food is and how you define it
4393120 are we going to ban the taquerias chinese food places
4393121 a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
4393122 when you talk about fast food restaurants youre thinking burgers and fries and chips and pizza
4393123 its important to keep things healthy but we also have to have choice when we have ordinances that limit businesses it sets a precedent that sometimes has wide ranging effects
4393124 i think people sometimes think we have to do something to make ourselves feel good regardless of whether it will have any effect
4393125 no matter how many fast food restaurants the city manages to keep out kids are going to find it somewhere
4393126 this worrying trend highlights the need to provide racially diverse and low income communities with healthier eating options and to take steps to curtail the increase in high fat low nutrition options like fast food
4393127 they liked hot cars they were out looking for hot cars and when they saw one they carjacked it
4393128 if it doesnt go as they want they shoot with semiautomatic guns
4393129 while recovery is lengthy and a pain in the neck i might point out i am doing well i am walking and have even answered a couple of e mails but i am mostly immobile basically waiting for five hunks of bone to fuse into one its like watching grass grow only slower the upside i may be slightly taller
4393130 consent must be obtained for any use of the plant property

4393133 these small ones you roast em in a little garlic and olive oil and theyre delicious
4393134 we never have to take the car to get fresh vegetables for dinner
4393135 it is astounding that after admitting to each and every charge and allegation the defendant now denies culpability
4393136 i never told anyone i was inheriting any money there is nobody to support
4393137 we all really wanted him to be real hes a liar thats the thing he tells such big stories most liars dont go that big thats what hes good at

4393142 neither should uninsured or unlicensed drivers who deliberately flout the law
4393143 driving requires full concentration at all times a moments distraction can make the difference between life and death
4393144 the government is committed to continually improving safety on britains roads
4393145 last year the number of people killed fell below 3 000 for the first time since records began in 1926 but eight people are still dying on the roads each day where carelessness or an uninsured disqualified or unlicensed driver causes a death it is right that the driver should face tough penalties
4393146 careless drivers put themselves and others at risk every time they get behind the wheel of a car
4393147 despite good progress in recent years to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on the uks roads more can be done to prevent the unnecessary loss of life
4393148 the introduction of this legislation will hit home the message that driving is a hazardous activity that requires total concentration allowing distractions to affect your standard of driving is not acceptable and will now be more appropriately punished under the law
4393149 spencer point gave us an opportunity to not only create a sophisticated residential unit but also to incorporate some of the latest green technologies
4393150 the sort of people who want flats like these are also the ones who have one eye on environmental issues and we would welcome as our neighbours
4393151 but its important to remember that not only does this play its part for the environment but it also helps to cut energy costs
4393152 weve had this kind of development in mind for some time but now it is particularly appropriate that we can start to pioneer this sort of development in birmingham setting the trend for others to follow
4393153 spencer point is our opportunity to reflect the practices commitment to design excellence and green issues
4393154 it is great to be able to take what was once used for one of the citys most traditional industries and transform it into a housing development that will be a benchmark for future schemes
4393155 buying a lap dance is not the same as buying a cappuccino
4393156 many local authorities have added their voice to growing calls for an end to licensing of lap dancing clubs as cafes
4393157 current licensing has acted as a floodgate to the industry whilst making it difficult for local authorities and local people to have a say in this process
4393158 it has helped normalise lap dancing clubs and attitudes that encourage seeing women as sex objects not people
4393159 the solution to this problem does not lie in tinkering with the licensing act 2003 or in planning controls the solution lies in licensing lap dancing clubs for what they are venues that provide visual entertainment for sexual stimulation in other words sex encounter establishments
4393160 we call on the government to restore democracy to the licensing process and send out a powerful message that buying a lap dance is not the same as buying a cappuccino
4393161 a lax licensing regime has led to the proliferation of lap dancing clubs in uk
4393162 straitjacketed by the licensing act 2003 local authorities have been powerless to stop the spread
4393163 they are compelled to license lap dance clubs like cafes despite having a very different social impact
4393164 lap dance clubs fuel a sexist culture of treating women as sex objects areas surrounding lap dance clubs can become no go areas for women
4393165 the only viable solution is to license lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments
4393166 this would untie the hands of local authorities and enable them to fulfil their duties under the gender equality duty
4393167 alongside local authorities across the country we urge the government to enact reform and give local communities a voice
4393168 on the final day of a consultation on how lap dancing clubs are licensed we call on the government to enact urgent reforms and give local authorities greater regulatory powers
4393169 since the introduction of the licensing act 2003 the number of uk lap dancing clubs has doubled and local authorities have been powerless to stop the spread
4393170 lap dancing clubs are in contradiction to efforts to promote gender equality yet by boxing lap dancing clubs into the same licensing category as cafes and concurrently requiring the promotion of gender equality the hands of local authorities have been tied
4393171 as venues offering thoroughly gendered entertainment similar in nature to sex cinemas or peep shows lap dancing clubs need to be recognised regulated and licensed for what they are part of the commercial sex industry not the ordinary leisure industry
4393172 tinkering with legislation primarily designed to regulate cafes and karaoke bars is not the vehicle for this neither is relying on planning controls
4393173 instead the only viable solution is to allow local authorities to licence lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments venues that provide visual sexual entertainment
4393174 this would give local authorities vital powers to regulate where when and on what terms lap dancing clubs may be established it would also make it easier for licensing committees to listen to residents
4393175 alongside object and the fawcett society we urge the government to introduce a public bill to this effect early in the new parliamentary term
4393176 it is time to give local authorities and local communities a voice
4393177 try to listen to as much music as possible because for us as musicians its like reading a book and you couldnt go and do surgery without having the knowledge and background of the people who came before you its so essential to understand how things broke from the blues to rock in the 50s to punk and metal its just really important to me to know the roots of all this music we have now and understand the process of how we got to where we are today

4393224 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4393225 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4393226 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films

4393252 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants

4393346 dass pop ein gegenentwurf zum ganzen sein k nnte daran kann man schon seit ungef hr 20 jahren nicht mehr glauben aber die umgekehrte diagnose dass es sich bei pop um ein ganz besonders perfides mittel der unterwerfung handeln m sse ist genauso falsch viele elemente der kulturellen ordnung pop haben sich weitgehend durchgesetzt zum beispiel die grundsatzfrage die immer an werke der pop musik gestellt wird was ist das eigentlich f r ein typ der das gerade spielt wie sieht der aus was will der diese frage wird inzwischen an alle kulturereignisse gestellt

4393400 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4393401 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4393402 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4393403 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4393413 an increasing of our offshore reserves of oil and gas is not the long term answer but effective action in the short term while we pursue this all of the above strategy
4393414 my response to the department of energy is lets try it lets try everything lets drill and drill now
4393415 sen obama said the surge wouldnt work that it would fail he voted to cut off funding for the men and women serving in iraq he refuses to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded
4393416 his recommended course of action has been called by the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff as a course very dangerous for america so i think hes wrong and i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party
4393417 at this time last year when i was here not only was i declared dead but i was reminded of the words of chairman mao who once said its darkest before its totally black
4393418 i think they want to have a situation that sends a message to the other nations in the region the baltics ukraine etc that they are now reasserting their traditional role of the russian empire in the region
4393419 the past is never past in fact it is never really gone
4393420 we must learn to live together as brothers and sisters or we shall perish together as fools
4393421 the japanese government should publicly apologize and put in history how the women were abducted and forced to serve in the comfort women system
4393422 we can never forget what they did to us until now its been a wound in our chest
4393423 if theres not continued access of humanitarian supplies if civilians are not protected if they are limited in where they can move its something that could develop into a crisis
4393424 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4393425 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance

4393429 it gives me a lot of confidence that they want me and comforting to know im with them
4393430 i slipped that far because i made it clear i was going to college
4393431 they made me a handsome offer but it was a no brainer to go to college
4393432 i want to make sure that if and when we do it its really good its perfect
4393433 itll be very limited but we should have answers very shortly
4393434 weve spent a lot of time doing a lot of wiring of ballparks doing a lot of checking

4393443 travellers who had earlier shifted from second ac and third ac to low cost airlines are now coming back to the railways owing to the rise in airfares in the past few months
4393444 when low cost flights were introduced many people who travelled by ac ii and ac iii went for air travel as they were inexpensive now with the increase in airfare they have reverted to train travel
4393445 the increase in airfares is not the only reason why people are choosing our premier trains we have also taken measures to increase passenger comfort and cater to the increased demand by adding extra coaches
4393446 governors rule is only temporary my intention is that elections are held on schedule and the situation returns to normal
4393447 we have to rise above considerations of religion and region to consolidate the gains of peace and progress we have achieved in the last 18 years
4393448 governors rule is only temporary my intention is that elections are held on schedule and the situation returns to normal
4393449 when people give us information about children at risk while we can go through the judicial process once it has happened the important thing is their welfare so intervention is more important from a child protection perspective
4393450 i think the campaign is much broader than just bringing a prosecution we want to inform people and change practice
4393451 there have been no prosecutions but an increase in the number of child protection referrals so the potential risk is being identified which i think is more important
4393452 it is not a religious practice at all that is a myth i think in certain communities you have one religion such as islam so people think it is a requirement of that religion but there are christians jews and non believers who do it
4393453 we want to work with communities and teachers in a positive way i think once people are informed about the issue that it is a violation of human rights in the uk and a form of child abuse
4393454 once they have had training to recognise that it makes it easier for them to challenge it
4393455 my eyesight is getting worse by the day but barnet pct has totally ignored my application for treatment
4393456 i live on my own but i might be forced into a care home if i dont get treatment i am sick with worry that barnet is letting me go blind and i will never see my grandchildren again
4393457 barnet pct has previously said that it will not fund because they cannot cap the costs of treatment
4393458 the warwickshire agreement means that argument is no longer valid it should change its cruel and heartless policy now
4393459 the pct is consulting with colleagues from other london pcts to try and ensure a joined up position across the capital regarding the funding of lucentis following the warwickshire agreement
4393460 a decision in barnet is expected to be made in the coming weeks and definitely before the end of august

4393464 anybody want to talk about the pick and roll now
4393465 we watched the game video of 2006 this morning we watched it yesterday pretty much every time we watched the scouting report
4393466 i think coach k mike krzyzewski and the coaching staff knew what they were doing any time you get beat its embarrassing thats enough and we really used that to help us
4393467 this isnt the game that weve been pointing to in the whole olympics
4393468 weve got five more games to win and were here for the gold medal but did we think about it being greece and what happened the last time of course we did
4393469 the last time we played them two years ago id say we might have had two or three guys tuned in to the defense this time we had all five guys tuned in and that means any five guys who were on the floor
4393470 that was something big that happened to them the last time we played a great game then it is not something that happens every two years maybe every 20 years
4393471 you could tell from the way they went through their warmups and then the way that they came out and played defense from the start of the game that this game was special that it had some extra meaning for them
4393472 were not thinking about any one team in this tournament the job and the goal are to win them all we won this one tonight against a team that beat us before i dont think we were hot and looking for redemption
4393473 i sort of used the sailing as a mental escape from the tragic circumstances of katrina
4393474 weve been blessed with a great business and great employees
4393475 there was so much devastation done by katrina it didnt kill the spirit of new orleans i think were an example of that
4393476 i use the sailing as a mental escape from the tragic circumstances of katrina
4393477 like ronald reagan said when he was asked about his age when he was running for president i want you to know that i will not make age an issue of this campaign
4393478 i am in better sailing shape than i have been in since i was 30
4393479 everyone here we have beaten on more than one occasion
4393480 we were given team uniforms about a week before the games started and it started hitting me then when i walked into the stadium for the opening ceremony it really hit me i am an olympian
4393481 i was looking over at yang wei and thinking that it was really cool to watch that
4393482 that motivates me i said to mark thats going to be me in four years im going to stay dedicated i feel that i have the ability
4393483 a little work here and there every single day and i hope i can stay healthy and god willing ill be in london
4393484 he didnt have the velcro in his feet that he had tuesday
4393485 but he had a good day hes already talking about coming back in four years and being one of the guys people expect to medal
4393486 i will guarantee you that yang wei has never had a week saying ah i dont care
4393487 even after world championships or olympics you have to stay motivated
4393488 i want to start learning new skills its going to take every single bit of the next four years to get on top
4393489 when im competing with the team it feels like life or death
4393490 ive got these five guys standing next to me and this has to be the greatest routine of my life im much more calm when im out there competing by myself
4393491 but my experience is starting to show i just went three days in a row without missing a single routine at the olympic games
4393492 not only am i an olympian im an olympic medalist its been an unbelievable experience the ups and downs with the team and with myself in the all around im just trying to soak it all in
4393493 en el potala hay ahora m s militares que monjes
4393494 here is a straightforward readable challenging and practical manual just what parents are looking for
4393495 his approach is what the bible calls wisdom as rich in biblical instruction as it is in psychological insight
4393496 anyone who has a true concern for the spiritual welfare of children in this present age must read this book
4393497 underscores the need not only to teach our children about god but also to develop a worldview that enables them to see the totality of their christian faith in all things i recommend it as an important book
4393498 all my friends and family live there my sister and her family live just a mile or so from the bombing and people have fled from my parents building in tbilisi others have sent their children away
4393499 it has been such an ordeal trying to get through to everyone to make sure they are safe the phones dont work but luckily i have managed to contact them via the internet we are very lucky there have been no family casualties
4393500 im very worried but im trying to be calm because of the baby
4393501 i wanted to go to london to demonstrate outside the russian embassy but i just cant in my condition
4393502 i do not believe in the ceasefire 100 per cent because the russian military is heading for abkhazia now another breakaway region my brother in law says the fighting and the bombing has not stopped
4393503 russia wants to own georgia and all the post soviet republics but they are independent countries and russia should withdraw
4393504 there is a major risk to the reputation of the whole council should the fire authority undergo an investigation and possible prosecution following the death of a member of staff or other person owed a duty of care by this fire authority
4393505 och dagen kom n r det var farligare att f rbli i knopp n att sl ut i blom
4393506 you wonder if the council is really behind the project
4393507 you get the feeling they are using delaying tactics so it doesnt go ahead
4393508 the cost runs into hundreds of pounds as some substances are very expensive to get rid of
4393509 we have found huge quantities of tyres dumped at ventnor down and culver down and recently in the west wight we have had two instances of asbestos which has to be handled by specialist contractors
4393510 we do patrol but we only have a few staff and a lot is dumped at night i dont think it is just an nt problem i think most landowners suffer
4393511 theyre still the best of friends but any romantic spark has well and truly gone its really sad but theres no one else involved
4393512 john is still mulling over their relationship he likes to have some space before deciding it is definitely over but he may be too late
4393513 if these rumours that she is dating a model are true hell be gutted john is usually the one who serial dates it will be like a kick in the teeth if jen has found someone else straight away
4393514 i feel bad for the poor horse hes probably going to die soon anyway
4393515 as long as hes being taken care of they should leave him alone
4393516 i would prefer to have him remain as stable as he is and be able to enjoy his life i like to go out and pet him its just a matter of feeding and petting him
4393517 i feel bad for the poor horse hes probably going to die soon anyway
4393518 as long as hes being taken care of they should leave him alone

4393543 if he were here he would tell us to not forget what were about and thats taking care of the people
4393544 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4393545 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4393546 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side
4393547 i went to bill and i said i hate to do this but i need to borrow some money to bury my father
4393548 he said blaine whatever you need youve got it thats the kind of man bill was he had a deep love for all of his employees and i can say we all had a deep love for him
4393549 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
4393550 i think the whole thing is more of symbolic importance
4393551 its establishing a presence showing the flag and challenging the expansion of russian power in that country
4393552 the united states government then will turn to questions of both economic reconstruction and also what to do to help the georgian security forces looking to the longer term future
4393553 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4393554 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4393555 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4393556 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4393557 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4393558 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4393559 two nations are in your womb and two peoples will be separated from your body and one people shall be stronger than the other and the older shall serve the younger
4393560 please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there for i am famished
4393561 behold i am about to die so of what 33 and jacob said
4393562 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4393563 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4393564 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4393565 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4393568 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4393569 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4393570 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4393571 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4393572 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4393573 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4393574 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4393575 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4393576 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4393577 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4393578 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4393579 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4393580 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4393581 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4393582 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4393583 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4393584 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4393585 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4393586 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4393587 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4393588 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4393589 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4393590 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4393591 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4393628 i always feel like i can win whether its against michael phelps or anyone
4393629 i knew i just had to go out and do my normal routine thats what my dad kept saying dont do anything better than you know how to do dont do anything worse just go out and do it normal
4393630 a little bit but i cant control anyone but me so theres no reason to get nervous for other people hoping ill do better than them i knew that if i went out there today and hit my routines the way i was hoping to and the way ive been training i had a good chance
4393631 i think this makes it a little sweeter just knowing ive been through some pretty big injuries and some doubters but honestly i think it made me so much stronger and it made me the person that i am today
4393632 its definitely been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4393633 i knew i had to go out there and go all out and not hold anything back
4393634 its definitely been a dream come true for both of us hes worked just as hard as i have just being with me in the gym every single day traveling with me all over the world i could not be more thankful
4393635 my mom too she plays a huge role i havent talked to her yet im not sure if she was here watching but i texted her so she knows
4393636 shes the moral support side of it for both my dad and me when things get hot at the gym shes always there to calm us down
4393637 it makes it even more amazing knowing that exactly 20 years ago my dad competed at the 88 olympics he was so close to winning that all around gold medal less than a tenth away just standing there on that podium thinking about that i hoped that i made up for that and i hope he feels just as proud as i am of it
4393638 well obviously shes an athlete and shes a great athlete its not easy to be second but we did make some mistakes and we were ready at that time
4393639 i went up there and give it my heart and soul but nastias been around a while she has a lot of experience and she deserved that gold today

4393674 when you look at assessment over time you are going to see plateau years
4393675 treadmill desks have allowed users to lose as much as 50 70 lbs a year by encouraging walking throughout the work day at slow speeds without sweating
4393676 the amount of medical evidence focusing on the curative powers of walking is overwhelming it is no coincidence that our ever increasing sedentary lifestyles have led us down a road of ill health the good news is that road can be reversed with proper dietary selection and daily walking
4393677 many of these medical studies have shown that when we sit not only does our metabolism slow but also our lymphatic and digestive systems which cleanse our bodies of toxins and wastes lose efficiency as well which may greatly increase the incidence or likelihood of disease nature designed us to walk not sit chairs are basically killing many of us slowly each day
4393678 in essence you burn more calories than you would with an intense two hour work out without sweating waiting in line at a gym or sacrificing time with family and friends also this is a no fail proposition we have all started exercise programs and quit but we still go to work each day trekdesk is always there waiting for you to start your work day it is automatic and self reinforcing it just feels better to walk than to sit
4393679 if walking were a drug we would call it a miracle cure and everyone would be clamoring to buy it our bodies have more power to cure ourselves than any drug if we are willing to make the changes to our lifestyle
4393680 i am a convert now i cant imagine sitting in a chair all day ever again
4393681 once you place your work or hobbies on the trekdesk the rest is automatic you turn on the treadmill and just start working and walking you leave work feeling more energetic productive with the knowledge you enhanced your health and burned a lot of excess calories as well
4393682 the detective was a little surprised by the mannequin because you know you dont know if you have a mannequin or a body

4393698 ive heard about dogs and cats getting lost but a horse
4393699 people are losing their houses and are being forced into apartments but a rental that allows pets is very difficult to find in santa cruz
4393700 we cant take any more in unless someone is willing to fully sponsor their horse but that isnt usually the case for owners
4393701 it was not my intention to violate the brown act i hope you will forgive this lapse it will not happen again

4393703 im not wild about reporters serving in public office but i think its admirable jondi took responsibility and disclosed that
4393704 this can be a learning opportunity for anybody in public office
4393705 because of the way the information was revealed the way the men in georgia have been acting and the fact that the only bigfoot researcher that they allowed to see the body was tom biscardi is a little questionable based on past experience this is more likely a hoax than not
4393706 in 10 to 15 years virtually everyone on the planet will have to get a new roof imagine if everyone installed a cool roof
4393707 its such an amazing story and so few people really know about them
4393708 they represent the unknowns about the natural world the more we learn about them the more we cant explain i watch them in awe they are inspiring
4393709 theres a coldwater upwelling in the bay this summer so the bait fishes are back which means the sooty shearwaters are back too they are magnificent
4393710 its not an ideal situation but its better than it could have been
4393711 i close my door lean back in my chair put my feet up and for 20 minutes im out
4393712 were misguided in our lack of naps and in this our society is driven by economy and not biology weve gotten rid of naps even though theyre good for us but that idea is coming back
4393713 some companies are starting to realize the benefits to cognitive abilities and how we get those with naps
4393714 we know theres something fundamental that happens and that a nap is just a part of full sleep weve hypothesized that theres something about deep sleep that allows the cells in the brain to reorganize
4393715 theres an intuitive part of it if it feels good after you nap then its good for you
4393716 we used to do it here in north america its part of the farming culture
4393717 i grew up on a farm outside of peterborough and everyone kind of had a nap after a big lunch
4393718 we all know about it think about the picture of the person with their belt buckle undone after a meal relaxing on the couch with their eyes closed
4393719 if you look at recent literature there is a global phenomenon that people are getting less sleep than 50 years ago
4393720 research shows that when youre behind the wheel a nights sleep deprivation impairs you to the same level as being legally drunk

4393727 it wasnt our best performance last night but i can tell you that we will be ready for saturday
4393728 sometimes things like this can just happen in football we have the quality in our team we just need to step up now and look forward to sunderland
4393729 last night was disappointing but we have to be positive
4393730 im back in training and feel 100 per cent so ill be ready for the start of the season at sunderland
4393731 it was really important for me to be involved in the pre season training camp in switzerland and i worked hard unfortunately another small problem kept me out when i got a kick on my shin which caused some inflammation but im now looking forward to the start of the season
4393732 it will be the managers decision whether i will be involved against sunderland i hope to do a good job and help the team make a good start to the season
4393733 pepes probably one of the best at penalty saves and youve got to be really confident when hes up against one because of his record
4393734 it was a harsh decision though but then again ive heard that the other one was over the line so maybe theyve cancelled each other out
4393735 we know we didnt play as well as we can and they did well so we have to be pleased to get out of it with a nil nil
4393736 we probably didnt deserve it but thats football and over the years weve always seemed to find these kind of games difficult but gone on to do well and hopefully this time it will be the same
4393737 we have to trust ourselves and believe we can do it the squad has improved season after season and we have to believe this can be our year
4393738 i hope that in ten months we can be celebrating i would like to win the premier league firstly for our supporters but also because its the most difficult competition in the world
4393739 we just want to be involved in every competition this season

4393766 he hecho un primer lanzamiento a asegurar para hacerlo v lido un segundo que se me ha escapado de la mano y en el tercero he tenido buenas sensaciones pens que era de m s de veinte metros y sin embargo nada m s que fue de 19 80 por lo tanto no he sabido estar a la altura
4393767 ahora mismo no lo s ha sido algo muy fuerte para m t en a puestas muchas ilusiones y no me llevaba una desilusi n tan grande desde hace muchos a os
4393768 cada uno sabe en cada momento en la posici n en la que est y hoy no era mi posici n el veinte del mundo
4393769 tengo que ver cu les son mis posibilidades y como he dicho m s de una vez a o a a o plantearme si voy a seguir compitiendo tengo que tener ilusi n y ganas de continuar porque estar en la alta competici n es algo muy dif cil se necesita mucho esfuerzo y se sacrifican muchas cosas por ejemplo llevo sin ver a mis hijas un mes y medio y es sacrificado

4393775 all of my friends are drogheda fans and my family are drogheda fans but bohs pay my wages these sort of things tend to happen in football
4393776 i over reacted a little bit when i scored twice in united park earlier in the season and ive learnt from that there wont be any similar celebrations on friday unless i score a hat trick
4393777 at the start of the season it was tight enough between us and we have them twice more in the league still
4393778 it is going to be tough but we are on our home patch drogheda are in great form at the moment although the cup is a different kettle of fish

4393816 churring filled the twilight then close at hand came a soft quick call and we saw the silhouettes of a pair of nightjars their long wings rose and fell as they encircled us the reason was a fledgling on the path a few metres ahead its eye gleaming in the torch light the parents circled us even faster like in a playground game clapping their wings as we approached the bird on the path silently flew off

4393824 it can be my only present and i dont need a stocking
4393825 well love im going to go do the dishes now you think about it and in a little while we can do some brainstorming
4393826 i can save up for one and buy it in the new year if i get any christmas money i can use that towards it too
4393827 i got a review in the new york times and god its the best review ive ever got in 33 years
4393828 but i suppose the appeal for me is that we live in such a corporate world that the buck is continually being passed rarely do our elected leaders say you know something this is all my fault and im going to do something about it i respect people who do that and im drawn to those people who stand up for something
4393829 and its either something that gets under my skin or it doesnt and i did love the action of this one ive done a few of what i could call cowboy in armour films its play acting with shields and spears and its like being a kid again i also loved the fact that i was being asked to do it i was 54 now 56 and i thought in a few years time im never going to be asked to do this sort of stuff again
4393830 theres a huge part of me that would have loved to have been on set with those kids because i love the physicality of making films
4393831 ive learnt over the years not to over think things for me its an instinctive thing and the more i try to intellectualise the process the more i can mess it up
4393832 what i did find interesting territory on this one however is the violence im a father ive got two sons and you wonder what your own reaction would be if your child was taken you soon come to the conclusion that youd do anything in your power to save your child
4393833 i grew up amongst the troubles in northern ireland i was surrounded by violence and bitterness and the desire for revenge bryans thinking is its them or me and i certainly knew lads who thought like that but that idea is anathema to me and i couldnt wait to get out of it
4393834 the trouble with northern ireland is that youre cursed if you speak and youre cursed if you dont at least you are in my position
4393835 im no expert but those couples that say oh weve been married for 20 years and weve never had an argument is a load of bollocks
4393836 at the moment theyre 12 and 13 and theyre both very happy with the idea of being sports stars or rock musicians and im very happy with that
4393837 im less driven than i use to be well im not less driven when it comes to the preparation for it im more driven for that but all the rest of it the trappings of the movie business i must admit that the older i get i have very very little patience with it
4393838 there is something extraordinary about presenting something to an audience of people and that audience changes every night and its live and its never to be repeated and it just taps into something quite mythic
4393839 he believed in the destiny of democracy and he was an extraordinarily complex man of course these characters usually are theyre not simple people
4393840 when you see you still wont understand but you wont ask why again
4393841 no you dont not yet the fear is speaking for you yet listen and be patient
4393842 we have to look after them here they arrive from all over
4393843 these are the ones who disappear late at night early in the morning after school they arrive here
4393844 when they have passed through the system which is actually death they are brought here they are here because their removal from life is never fully acknowledged their protectors never know where they have gone
4393845 limbo implies a state of inaction that leads onto another state good or bad they never leave this room
4393846 the figure increases every minute every second it isnt pleasant
4393847 and we are brought up to believe in heaven and hell
4393848 that getting murdered raped or tortured is as bad as it gets that in the after world the bad get their comeuppance and the good will sip sangria on a beach in paradise not that the innocent will suffer for eternity
4393849 it wasnt how it was supposed to be but most systems turn bad in the end
4393850 the grieving process never ends do we ever consider the reason for this after all there is no good reason why someone so young and innocent is taken away there is no getting over it there is no end to the anguish
4393851 and you are showing me this because i am part of another system
4393852 its just a system we try to categorize everything in life some things just dont belong anywhere thats all think of it as a complicated computer program that cannot be actioned without this piece of code that makes up this room
4393853 emotions make up our very being they create and destroy they burn rightly for a second for a month sometimes for years the point being that they die eventually when we let them go like balloons in a strong wind
4393854 waiting for someone else to grab hold of the passing string
4393855 all of these are the ones that disappear fly too high for anyone to touch they have too much energy it used to make me laugh how people talked about how voices and feelings fly away into the stratosphere entirely metaphorical of course but they didnt know how close they were to the truth
4393856 away from here thats for sure we had better leave you are stronger than me after all and i cant manipulate every situation
4393857 are you ok look these kids need to get to school before nine
4393858 great why dont you tell them youve been drinking again

4393864 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4393865 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4393866 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4393867 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4393868 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4393869 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4393870 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4393871 im confused just hold me here i dont know what to do
4393872 if you could live your life over again what would you change
4393873 you can get an exchange of momentum and cause motion to occur without much power
4393874 it takes a little power but nowhere near as much as if you were spinning up or down the disc

4393879 de contacts continus sur le sujet avec la grande bretagne
4393880 je crois quil est possible de parvenir un arrangement qui satisfasse les parties libyenne et bulgare et qui permette de sortir de limpasse
4393881 la formation dune organisation non gouvernementale bulgare ou lintervention de lue aupr s des familles des victimes pour arriver avec elles une solution pour payer le prix du sang conform ment la loi islamique et annuler les condamnations mort
4393882 il nest pas question de payer des compensations aux familles des enfants contamin s car cela reviendrait reconna tre que les condamn s sont coupables
4393883 nous cherchons un arrangement en dehors du cadre gouvernemental par le biais dorganisations
4393884 sur le point dabolir la peine capitale afin douvrir la voie une commutation des peines des cinq bulgares et du m decin palestinien
4393885 dans linoculation d lib r e du virus du sida aux enfants
4393886 positif cela montre que la cour est convaincue de nos arguments et quelle va relancer les enqu tes sur la contamination des enfants
4393887 la cour rejette les recours en appel des accus s et confirme la peine de mort
4393888 un accord a t conclu entre la fondations kadhafi et les familles des enfants contamin s qui r glera le cas des infirmi res et du m decin palestinien
4393889 cet accord satisfait toutes les parties et met fin la crise les d tails seront d voil s ult rieurement
4393890 le pr sident de la r publique fran aise monsieur nicolas sarkozy et le pr sident de la commission europ enne monsieur jose manuel barroso se f licitent de laccord qui a enfin permis cette lib ration et ce retour en bulgarie des infirmi res d tenues depuis plus de huit ans et du m decin palestinien ainsi que de la mise en place dun dispositif am lior pour assurer les soins d livr s aux enfants victimes du sida en libye
4393891 saluent le geste dhumanit de la libye et de son plus haut dirigeant et sengagent tout faire pour aider les enfants atteints du sida

4394005 there are two occasions when peoples faith in democracy was dented first in 1975 when constitutional power was misused to impose emergency it is a blot on the history of free india this year the second blot came we have been complaining of money power in elections this time we saw money power being misused to influence parliament
4394006 i thought the prime ministers speech would have a direct or indirect reference to the cash for vote scandal although there was a mention of the amarnath controversy i would have been satisfied if there was a mention of this controversy too

4394015 it is over three weeks since we learned that the portuguese authorities had closed the investigation to find madeleine lifted our arguido status and ended judicial secrecy
4394016 we were surprised that copies of investigation files were given to the media the content of these files has been extensively reported it will be clear to everyone now that there is absolutely no evidence that suggests madeleine has been seriously harmed
4394017 knowing this we strongly believe that madeleine is out there and can be found of course whoever is responsible for madeleines abduction must and can be found to prevent them from putting another child and family through the misery we have suffered

4394025 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4394026 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution
4394027 this is a very important industry for the future of australia for the public interest and for the national interest
4394028 we need to find ways to assist the industry to begin
4394029 we feel that in the longer term situation that governments will become responsible anyway

4394031 we will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4394032 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4394033 however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4394034 we will now investigate whether this can be regarded as a trend that was previously not recognised if this is the case it is out task to report this
4394035 in the same way we delete marriages involving fourteen year olds a man with two wives just cannot exist by law
4394036 they are simply acknowledged it is important for us to check that the documents are authentic and that the husband does not have dutch nationality
4394037 the main push has been a firmer us dollar across the board as well as weaker commodities

4394081 i hope our successes will continue with the new management
4394082 no written statement has been dispatched by nato to the russian defense ministry
4394083 there is no restriction from the turkish side to the deployment of the ship off aksaz
4394084 we are told that its a technical problem the u s delegation failed to show up this thursday morning at nato headquarters which resulted in the nato russia council not going ahead
4394085 this is very odd because nato permanent representatives had enough time to discuss this problem here today thursday during the council session
4394086 they had enough time to invite the georgian ambassador and listen to his propaganda this is unacceptable
4394087 i have a thought of creating a stability and cooperation platform for peace in the caucasus
4394088 the welfare in the region is possible not with tensions but comprehensive projects based on common interests
4394089 the objective here is to let the peace in the region reign the caucasus pact will open this path

4394091 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4394092 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4394093 deep economy the wealth of communities and the durable future
4394094 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy
4394095 who bought as an investment are trying desperately to offload them
4394096 but they are caught in a trap as the price of their flats has plunged and they cant sell
4394097 massive for sale signs in the windows and restaurants that are half empty

4394100 at least three thousand people are expected to participate to the congress
4394101 an outsider in the oecd environment closer to the concerns of the developing world
4394102 a modern market economy equipping itself with effective macro economic institutions and micro economic rules
4394103 the last six years of growth havent simply marked a return to past output or employment levels or the artificial result of inflows of
4394104 however traditional industries based on low cost labour have been hit by competition from lower cost emerging economies with employment in these industries shrinking young people flooding into the labour market and insufficient job opportunities elsewhere turkeys total employment rate has declined and the aggregate unemployment rate has risen slightly
4394105 this combined with a fall in real interest rates should give an extra push to investments employment and growth we believe that turkey can sustain a somewhat higher current account deficit than in the pre 2001 period within reasonable proportions without relapsing into economic crisis if the economy works to its full capacity maintaining its competitive edge and increasing productive investments it will be able to finance a higher current deficit through foreign investment inflows without having to resort to much higher external debt
4394106 the central bank must be given more active support in its drive to lower inflation both through structural reforms in such areas as competition and labour market policy and through wage and price restraint agreements between employers and labour unions
4394107 until this structural schizophrenia is addressed turkey will fall short of full efficiency and competitiveness because of the barriers facing its companies in tapping capital markets skilled labour resources and foreign direct investment
4394108 nothing will change if the shipyards are moved to any other place without improving the situation in tuzla
4394109 i do not believe that the minister brings down the agenda of shutting down the shipyards
4394110 a targeted number of shipyards should be removed from tuzla or tuzla should be closed down
4394111 why does not the state disclose this plan let this plan be public and let us talk about the realities
4394112 restless authoritarianism under the rule of prime minister vladimir putin
4394113 at least 72 hours prior to ships or aircraft crossing the ukrainian border
4394114 the most brilliant and effective world leader at this point
4394115 however postponing loosening or lifting the smoking ban would be unacceptable
4394116 there was no exact observation of a drop in the sales of cigarettes in the first months of the ban we dont know the reason for that yet there is a drop in smoking by 10 to 20 percent according to some public surveys i cannot understand why sales did not fall we need five or six months to clarify these it is still too early to give exact statistical data
4394117 there are about 1 700 illegal pakistani immigrants detained in turkish prisons
4394118 we falsely believe that big cities are the only centers of art in a country turkey is not only composed of three big cities
4394119 in big cities only a small segment of residents attend biennial or biennial like art events yet residents of anatolian provinces have more interest in art and art events they try to perceive the essence of art in these provinces art itself is not seen as a field that is solely the concern of elites
4394120 those who want to enjoy a unique biennial atmosphere can buy a sinop passport with cuneiform writings and join us
4394121 it was completely different from all prisons in the world when i was a kid i used to go there to play games rather than going to a childrens parks prisoners used to organize art events and display art works they produced prominent names of turkish art stayed in that prison
4394122 we have also taken steps to renovate the abandoned tekel building under the name of the black sea cultural cooperation center
4394123 such perception creates problems it is the reason why residents of big cities and small cities have prejudices against each other
4394124 but it is a unique city many renaissance icons were made out of the red soil transported from sinop there exists a museum in italy where samples of these works are displayed unfortunately we have failed to properly promote sinop both to our people and to the world
4394125 art exists where capital exists in the contemporary world when we first introduced the idea of hosting a biennial in sinop and calling it sinopale people described it as a marginal idea but we have overcome all problems by keeping our commitment to our project fresh
4394126 merely 10 to 12 percent of 20 million buildings are insulated
4394127 considering turkey imports 85 to 90 percent of its annual energy need the more we can insulate then the more we can conserve
4394128 it is possible to conserve up to 7 billion worth of energy
4394129 turkish ministers have attended day long meetings with the representatives of international monetary fund to be able to receive 700 million credits if we manage to insulate 5 to 10 percent of the buildings each year then 50 to 60 percent of the buildings will be insulated after 10 years
4394130 this means 1 million savings in the first year while this level increases by one and a half to two fold in the second year however the ministry of finance has not taken any initiative to reduce the value of vat although the ministry of public works and electrical work examining board supports this move
4394131 we need to first establish what risk is we need to understand risk then what follows is to find the mathematical methods for risk management
4394132 we have at sabanc university a support unit dealing with applications the help of this unit has been instrumental in my receiving this award
4394133 an academicians time is valuable at the university our understanding is that an academician should spend his time in scientific research not in bureaucracy
4394134 we have a directorate in the university with the acronym alp which monitors all research opportunities worldwide informing our researchers and encouraging them to apply
4394135 when alp first approached me about the ecr advanced grant i really did not have any intention to apply since i did not have the time to spend on all the paper work that the application required but then they talked me into it
4394136 how many every day meaningless incidents can get beaten up into a news story
4394137 there could be a misjudgment like irans nuclear bid only threatened israel however this is a regional threat and turkey needs to take steps about this
4394138 ahmadinejad keeps asserting that he is a strong enemy of israel on every platform however despite this antagonism i think he would avoid making statements targeting israel during a visit to a neighboring country
4394139 israel is disappointed that turkey has invited for an official visit a leader who denies publicly the holocaust and thus grants him legitimacy
4394140 its part of the story we know but its been in the background until now
4394141 youll have individual episodes about different jedi specific events different areas of the war from the front lines with the soldiers
4394142 this isnt the star wars weve always known and at least sometimes loved
4394143 m zekart receives greatest interest in the topkap palace hagia sofia museum and cappadocia there is pretty much interest from all regions of the country but istanbul has lots of museums which is why more cards are sold there tourists who previously visited istanbul did not show interest in museums because they had to pay a different fee for each part of museums now thanks to m zekart they have a chance to visit 16 museums in the city at a price of ytl 20
4394144 tourists in konya visit the mevlana museum only the museums entrance fee is ytl 2 this low entrance fee and the fact that the other museums are not visited is the reason why the card is not sold in the city the situation is very different in other cities entrance fees in istanbul and cappadocia museums are higher and there are many museums and ruins this is why tourists prefer to buy this card in these places
4394145 i wasnt thinking about winning two gold medals at the two consecutive olympic games
4394146 what i wanted to do is show my best performance here in beijing im so relieved
4394147 i didnt feel pressure before the competition i tried to relax
4394148 and in the race i just swam at my own pace not caring about others my coach said to me that we will have two chinese swimmers in the final so you dont need to force yourself to win gold you just need to try your best
4394149 the pressure was much less we swam together and i felt like we were in training
4394150 the campaign assists in the survival of turtles with donations from the public 2 600 sea turtles have been adopted since 2006 this season approximately 25 30 000 newborn turtles will reach the sea from the adana akyatan coast and many from antalya ral coast by donating ytl 10 you can adopt one of them and help them to stay alive
4394151 the period from april to may is the mating season of the caretta carettas which begin to dig their nests from june to july
4394152 the hatchlings leave their eggs in august and september which is rather unfortunate because it is the peak tourism season and the hatchlings are exposed to the dangers presented by the people
4394153 the major nesting areas of the caretta carettas are antalyas belek mersins anamur and mu las k yce iz and dalyan districts
4394154 belek coast the second most important nesting area after the zakynthos island of greece is the largest nesting area with more than 1 000 nests
4394155 mature caretta cerattas opt for calm and quiet beaches on which to lay their eggs surprisingly enough there has been a substantial increase in the number of nests with the growth of the tourism sector in the antalya region while the number of nests was around 400 in 1998 it has gone up to more than 1 000 today it is not easy to explain it
4394156 we call the first 35 meter area of the beach from the sea onward the spawning belt this brings up the issue of use of the beach which basically means to keep the people and the hotel facilities such as deck chairs umbrellas and electric lights away from this area this is a legal obligation for the hotels located along the nesting areas of the caretta carettas however we need to have a sense of social responsibility and understanding to protect the natural environment before that
4394157 the most important source of income in the region is thyme and sage collected from the mountains
4394158 also the land on which we produce olive and bay trees is not as fertile as we expect
4394159 we decide the price of the products according to quality the thyme which is sells for ytl 2 to 2 5 in other regions has a great market in g kbel village the buyers pay more than ytl 3 6 for thyme in g kbel without hesitation because they know the quality of our plants
4394160 we are faced with the difficulty of buying ships as a result of unfair competition countries who are not sensitive to the environment and who do not care about worker health and safety give more than 200 per ton to disassemble ships we were had been waiting for a long time before this ship arrived and the arrival of vega oil has delighted our ship industrialists
4394161 music sponsorship has become an important component in our marketing mix
4394162 the youth of today identifies with music and this is the expression of todays attitude toward life
4394163 musiksponsoring hat sich zu einem wichtigen baustein in unserem marketing mix entwickelt
4394164 die heutige jugend identifiziert sich mit musik und dies ist ausdruck des heutigen lebensgef hls
4394165 die hoffnung auf sinkende strompreise ist vor allem daher irref hrend weil es sich bei den durchleitungsgeb hren f r bertragungsnetze lediglich um einen kleinen bestandteil der netzentgelte handelt netzentgelte machen zwar insgesamt etwa 30 des endpreises f r strom aus der kostenanteil der bertragungsnetze um die es im urteil ging betr gt aber gerade einmal 4 prozent allein die steigenden beschaffungspreise f r energie zehren die kosteneinsparungen durch sinkende bertragungsnetzgeb hren mehr als auf
4394166 zudem best tigt das urteil des bgh lediglich in weiten teilen das verfahren zur berechnung einer geb hr das bereits seit jahren durch die regulierungsbeh rden in dieser form praktiziert wird davon sind nat rlich ebenso die aktuellen strompreise der endverbraucher betroffen
4394167 auch die 50 millionen euro die vattenfall gegen ber seinen wettbewerbern zu verrechnen hat sind lediglich ein tropfen auf den hei en stein und werden keine positiven effekte f r die verbraucher haben
4394168 vor dem hintergrund weiterhin hoher kosten f r fossile energietr ger rechnen wir damit dass gerade im herbst und zum jahreswechsel zahlreiche anbieter ihre preise f r strom erh hen werden
4394169 i expect this number to surpass 1 million toward the end of the year
4394170 there is no stagnation in the real estate sector instead there are people who do not know enough about the industry some the new projects failed to receive the attention of the customers as a result they were not sold
4394171 meanwhile projects constructed in the right location and put up for sale at the right price are sold without any problems
4394172 multifunctional projects which have a theme and which encompass their own villa residence business center shopping center and even a school and a hospital on the basis of the basic needs of the region will not encounter any problems in receiving the attention of the customers in the upcoming period
4394173 we can also observe the same activity for this year the increase in the demand for real estate will in turn increase the prices in the sector for the short term
4394174 meanwhile contractors will begin to launch projects targeting lower and middle income groups for the medium term and this will in turn further boost demand in the sector however we need to wait until the spring of next year for the realization of these improvements in the sector
4394175 we come across a variety of second owner houses that are either put up for sale or rent these numbers will increase
4394176 we will experience a further decline in the prices of these houses from october onwards following the revival in the sector
4394177 of course the negotiations are complex its normal but now the negotiations have started and its good i do not think that we are going to toward chaos
4394178 our position is clear on this issue a referendum should take place in palestine if they withdraw from occupied lands it would be a good step
4394179 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4394180 could start to stabilize as early as the first quarter of next year if the government program gains any traction
4394181 the areas of the country that saw prices go through the roof and then fall into the basement wont be the first ones to see an upturn blitzer said in an interview
4394182 its more likely to come in a place like cleveland or other midwestern cities that largely missed the boom
4394183 we are not looking for ruins like sculptures or columns here we bring the history of anatolia to light putting together the ruins of various eras that we found through restoration works
4394184 starting from 7 000 b c and continuing until the middle ages yumuktepe is a unique settlements because hundreds years of political social economic cultural and technological developments are hidden in this hill
4394185 we have found a structure made of reed and mud belonging to this era we will find out what kind of a building floor this is within a week also there were silos that we found in this area last year and we are planning to go lower at this point
4394186 we have found a fallen brick wall we carry out our works to bring out both of these structures
4394187 we found that the 11th century architecture was dominant in residences here and this place turned into a big farm in the 12th century we also got sarcophaguses and some column pieces we estimate that these pieces were brought here from the city center of that period we found the other pieces of sarcophagus many years ago in the same place too
4394188 we began to find good pieces during this years excavations we found ceramics produced in the byzantium period in various part of the mediterranean we also found ceramic pieces that were produced in syria and iran
4394189 turkey does not have a colonial past and this is very important it does not carry baggage from the past
4394190 we would welcome turkeys participation along with india and china china comes to africa with no baggage and is in africa only for business if the united states gives you a dollar it will tell you how to do your business
4394191 what is a matter of interest for us is how you balance your modernization while keeping your culture
4394192 migration is a major problem for countries on the northern side of the mediterranean like turkey therefore development of africa is vital in this point for these countries
4394193 i dont know what will be discussed the kurdish issue or something else but the television and newspapers in iran will reflect the visit very positively and as successful
4394194 atat rks mausoleum in ankara should be visited by the iran president too
4394195 most of the azeri people living in iran feel close to turkey however some radical islamists do not like turkey for being a secular country
4394196 iran and turkey are neighboring countries both cultures are similar we will help each other not america or another country
4394197 turkey is a secular country and it should stay so atat rk made many things for that country iran has a closed economy but still its economy is very good
4394198 this visit will be positive for both countries in terms of business art and other social activities
4394199 life in iran is much more modern than we know women keep their own surnames after the marriage but we have to take our husbands surname in turkey
4394200 efforts to reduce the tensions and establish a constructive dialogue
4394201 we will open branch offices in zmir and ankara in the beginning of 2009
4394202 we aim to operate in 12 different cities of the country by 2015
4394203 we provide service for more than 2 500 customers each day
4394204 we will give ytl 140 million to 150 million in credit this year we believe that this level will reach ytl 1 billion next year and ytl 2 billion the year after in addition we also think that this level will reach ytl 4 5 billion by 2012
4394205 turkey will find a path concerning the issue ko finance has made an application in this field meanwhile a couple of foreign companies also would like to work in the financing of residences five to six companies will be operating in this field in the near future
4394206 millions of young people in turkey begin to earn money and hence contribute to the countrys economy immediately after they graduate from university these young people would like to own small houses with a relatively low amount of credit
4394207 our company has prepared three products targeting university students taking into consideration this demand we do not propose every product to the customers from different segments of the society there is no single product for the satisfaction of a certain need instead there are different products for different needs
4394208 turbulence in the financial markets the rise in the price of oil and the fall of the dollar are making their mark on germany
4394209 means more than just a correction from an unusually strong first quarter
4394210 recent leading indicators have all pointed to a sharp slowdown in the second half manufacturing output has slowed sharply in recent months indicating that the prolonged period in which the german industry appeared to be immune against the toxic mix of global slowdown strong currency and very high oil prices has now come to an end
4394211 with growth collapsing in germanys most important trading partner countries we think recession is now also possible in germany
4394212 the leading indicators have meanwhile fallen sharply suggesting that a hard landing is on the cards although not as severe as in spain or the uk
4394213 but the morocco of poverty backward countryside and urban slums is increasingly averse to tourism and the internationalized elite
4394214 its discrimination by wealth and tourism is highlighting the sore
4394215 here the important thing is to establish the necessary infrastructure in order to deliver the microcredit rather than the amount
4394216 microcredit enables women to launch businesses with the primary aim to provide a sustainable income source in the struggle against poverty
4394217 we prefer this system because it is forward looking sustainable able to be a part of the balance sheet and accretive instead of aid or donation
4394218 we allocated 5 million on our balance sheet for microcredit until 2010 one third of the amount was appropriated for the more deprived parts of cities one third will be used in rural areas and the last third will be for young university graduated entrepreneurs
4394219 we specified a low interest rate as trlibor 1 percent for the microcredit the 1 percent addition is used either for donations or growing the microcredit sum
4394220 launching a business with microcredit provides the users self confidence and financial benefit as well as contributing to social welfare through bringing different parts of the society together
4394221 it also strengthens the role of the women they gain the opportunity to employ their husbands via launching a business through using microcredit
4394222 qbes got a very strong capital position and it sounds like pmi was a keen seller
4394223 the fact youre making an acquisition in this market generally means the sellers going to be heading the bid qbe has been well positioned to benefit from its strong capital position
4394224 joining star alliance whose member carriers transport some 30 percent of all air travelers in the world in april provided a 42 9 percent record increase in the number of transit passengers of thy in the first seven months of 2008
4394225 the income from sales constituted 73 percent of the aggregate sales last year this figure increased to 75 percent in the first seven months of this year
4394226 i suppose there is no air transport company as such which increases its number of passenger transportation capacity occupancy rate incomes and public image at the same time that much
4394227 we aim to carry 23 5 million passengers in total and to reach 4 5 billion turnover by the end of this year
4394228 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
4394229 with this senseless act of violence we have lost a good friend and honorable man
4394230 bill will be remembered for his hard work and dedication to the party and he will be sorely missed

4394237 ich bedauere die entscheidung von andreas kindt die deutsche telekom zu verlassen in den zur ckliegenden jahren hat er in unterschiedlichen funktionen die optimierung der it und produkttechnik von t online bzw t home ma geblich gestaltet
4394238 take the necessary measures to establish diplomatic relations on the level of embassies in accordance with the united nations charter and international laws
4394239 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4394240 the two presidents agreed on the resumption of the work of the joint committee to define and draw the syrian lebanese borders
4394241 the definition of the shebaa farms cannot happen under occupation
4394242 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
4394243 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
4394244 there are moments when we wonder whether all this was worthwhile or not
4394245 i can tell you that what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the u n is back the u n is back to stay
4394246 the first of its kind to be adopted in the country since the 1990s
4394247 the iraqi people are not ready to take over for themselves
4394248 iraqis do not yet know how to run a government and it is going to take some time to make this government function
4394249 we have to be able to move a lot of the investment to the private sector
4394250 our biggest way of improving security is to make sure that young people are employed
4394251 you claim to know everything that you are a very clever and able man but you lost your donkey
4394252 to make his blessed subjects happy god first lets their donkeys be lost then allows them to be found again
4394253 to make his blessed subjects happy god first lets their donkey become lost then allows them find it
4394254 the bill is not the partys work but it was perceived as if it belonged to the party
4394255 such works should be discussed within the party first it is an ill timed and fatal statement the content is bad s zen put the party in a difficult situation we are going through sensitive times that need caution and ultimate care this is valid for each one of us we all need to refrain from any actions or statements that could create new tensions
4394256 has proffered an olive branch to secular critics by publicly disowning his partys proposals to curb pornography and encourage school prayer
4394257 we have a leader if we need to stir up a problem he will do it himself its none of your business
4394258 turkey has long been the favored destination for musharraf in exile he is rumored to own property there
4394259 he musharraf spent his childhood in turkey speaks the language and loves the country but turkey is a muslim majority country and he may become a target
4394260 the government insiders said that if musharraf wants to quit he must do so before the impeachment proceedings begin leaving him with only a few days
4394261 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4394262 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4394263 if someone breaks the constitution breaks the laws should he be rewarded or punished
4394264 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
4394265 when small money in the market increases we understand that people are spending their last money on cigarettes and that things are not going well
4394266 this year business is slightly better than last year as most istanbul dwellers didnt go on vacation the state of the tourism sector in the south and the aegean is not very bright
4394267 its quite an extraordinary thing its the first time a preacher has convened the two presumptive candidates they are both fighting for that vote
4394268 mccain has a good record on that issue abortion and he must show that he will continue it as president
4394269 for mccain the aim will be to solidify evangelicals as a key constituency
4394270 for obama it is significant that he will be participating as an equal on the same stage as mccain in an evangelical church this signals the shift in the evangelical political landscape since 2004
4394271 this has a lot less to do with what is going on in california and more to do with what is going on in ohio pennsylvania and florida the big swing states
4394272 in all of these states there is a sizable evangelical population that does not directly identify with the old religious right
4394273 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4394274 we will achieve independence in accordance with all of the rules of international law
4394275 i cant give a timetable but it is very realistic
4394276 the aim of independence has been set and we will move toward it together
4394277 if the dtp is closed down chaos will settle in
4394278 we are embarking on enterprises in croatia they are not moving the ship although we paid 300 000 euros to the ship manufacturers our agreement was off aug 16 though they demanded we did not accept to pay for the cruises after this date we have paid this cruises fee as cash the croatian firm is committing a crime resisting to move the ship
4394279 we are strong in countries like egypt dubai saudi arabia ghana and iran we sell large numbers of fancy lacy underwear corsets and underwear with garters the g string for men we produced in iran is also sold in large amounts
4394280 i have patients who are housewives or who wear headscarves some people think it is not against religion and it is not addictive
4394281 the hungarian wrestler who beat me in the semifinal is no better than the ones i beat in earlier rounds
4394282 if luck was on my side i would have been in the final
4394283 i have won european and world titles what i missed is an olympics title
4394284 i believed that beijing was my chance for that and i did my best but could not make it
4394285 this is the first games we have prepared under autonomous sports federations we met every need of our athletes
4394286 champion athletes may fail but young athletes should have filled in their shoes
4394287 there is an obvious failure here and our federation board not the young athletes is to blame we have done what we thought was right but it seems that we were wrong
4394288 both vessels are running 15 to 20 minutes behind schedule we apologize for any incontinence this may cause you
4394289 some sad incidents happened at a time when we had a boom in the tourism industry it is as if the sun had set at noon
4394290 my effort will be bring the leaders of the agitation to the table so that all the problems are resolved
4394291 you know what you need a 357 snub nose a 40 glock subcompact what something smaller you are a skinny thing whatcha need is one of them whore guns
4394292 yeah somethin a whore could stick up under her bra like one of them kel tec 32s ive got one and its definitely the one for what ya need it was the only gun i could smuggle into the hospital when i had my bypass surgery if i could carry it in one of those open assed paper gowns without the nurses noticing while they wiped my ass you can hide one on your skinny little self
4394293 the conversion of a parking garage built in the 1960s to a platinum leed certified structure that includes class a office space and top of the line retail space is unheard of
4394294 the embodiment of where we need to go with society in terms of environmental responsibility
4394295 you probably wont see your money back but you really have a sustainable building
4394296 its not normal for us to sell out of flavors
4394297 i just came from a heat wave in ohio which was humid so this is wonderful
4394298 im standing behind a pole and wearing a hat i have to be careful or ill fry
4394299 hes an amazing and far reaching presence literally in that he was able to effectively direct an entire project from thousands of miles away
4394300 the field supervisor gives me a report on whats happening and we can share files pictures on our computer screens
4394301 for instance if we have aerial photos and i want them to excavate a certain area i can circle the place we want to talk about and they can make comments on the screen
4394302 the speed of the system is only as good as the weakest link
4394303 he would be awake at 4 a m and want to read reports online
4394304 when you cant sleep i figure you might as well get up and do something so i did
4394305 he loves having her there and sharing this passion of his
4394306 its not like standing there and walking around and smelling the soil
4394307 russias behavior over the past week has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4394308 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4394309 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4394310 a higher incentive to stand with us now than they did before now that they have seen what the russians have done in georgia
4394311 the era in which the united states and russia considered one another an enemy or strategic threat has ended
4394312 got a lot of folks smart folks analyzing the situation on the ground and of course briefing us on different possibilities that could develop in the area and the region
4394313 impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4394314 poland and the poles do not want to be in alliances in which assistance comes at some point later it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4394315 they want to paralyze the country as long as they can
4394316 they are putting everything in a nonusable condition and taking what they want
4394317 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4394318 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4394319 we suspect that this is revenge tehrik e taliban and al qaeda theyre all under attack we suspect this blast has been done by tehrik e taliban to take revenge for our activities
4394320 we are hitting their hideouts so naturally they are responding
4394321 i probably hit 18 greens and i dont remember chipping so that was good too
4394322 it was a great day it always feels good when you have no bogeys on your scorecard youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4394323 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased
4394324 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes
4394325 i think my game has always been there its more emotionally sometimes you have ups and downs and distractions and youre tired
4394326 ive played solid the last couple of weeks ive had my rest and my time to practice and get motivated i dont want to get too far ahead this is just one round hopefully it will continue to go in this direction
4394327 the only reason why you dont hear much about peytons marital life is that he doesnt like his family to get involve with the media

4394336 the patch should at least introduce the ability to tweak the dead zone in super monkey ball the dead zone is the orientation at which you could hold the iphone to stop moving
4394337 it will deliver a dramatic increase in our competitive position in a range of different research areas its a very very important step forward for the country as a whole
4394338 we have to actually do very very large computations in order to get answers to the questions were asking in science in general this is really a new paradigm to doing scientific research and its been growing enormously over the past three decades really the demands on the computational equipment just continue to increase
4394339 well now have machines available in the country which are really competitive with the best in the world which is a situation weve never been in before
4394340 there is lots of anger and fear in the local community and people fear that if this violence is not brought to an end eventually somebody will be killed
4394341 this attack happened at 3pm in the afternoon in broad daylight the people who shot this 14 year old boy knew exactly what they were doing and nobody involved in this feud can offer any excuses or justification for what has happened
4394342 weve had women and children driven from their homes weve had at least seven house petrol bombed weve had millions of euro of damage done to council property and private property
4394343 we also have very real anger and palpable fear in the wider community these people need to be brought to their senses
4394344 geh ren zum leben aber ich ver ndere nichts nur um der ver nderung willen alles hat ein ziel
4394345 it was so much fun because the public were here you could feel the energy
4394346 it was a terrorist attack with a bomb in the towns main street
4394347 it is very sad because people were celebrating when the bomb exploded
4394348 we will investigate any information that is passed to us and ensure it is accurate before responding in a proportionate and measured way
4394349 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4394350 however these types of enquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4394351 the main push has been a firmer us dollar across the board as well as weaker commodities
4394352 the us is not out of the woods but seems to be improving compared to the rest of the world
4394353 thats why the sentiment towards the us dollar has changed
4394354 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4394355 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution
4394356 this is a very important industry for the future of australia for the public interest and for the national interest
4394357 we need to find ways to assist the industry to begin
4394358 we feel that in the longer term situation that governments will become responsible anyway
4394359 australias energy security depends on us balancing australias oil and gas exploration and production capacity with our capacity to capture and store greenhouse gases
4394360 grasshopper manufacture is excited to work with ea partners to bring our new title to gamers around the world
4394361 they are a great partner who shares our commitment to quality and innovation while respecting our independence as a studio which is very empowering
4394362 grasshopper manufacture is one of the most daring and innovative independent studios in the world and ea partners is honored to be working with mikami san and suda san on this new project
4394363 ea partners is a truly global resource for the worlds best independent developers whether theyre in north america europe or asia
4394364 the reason for the request was that there were interventions filed and we were not even asked to file comments that is part of due process we shouldnt be going to court unless we have inputs
4394365 on matter of due process when petition is filed against the law provides that the other party should be given the right to be heard the government is like any other ordinary citizen who should be given the chance to be heard which is missing on this case
4394366 the moa ad is flawed in the process just as it is flawed in its provisions what was lost in the process was an appreciation for legitimacy in a democracy that stems from winning consensus including the consent of the governed
4394367 the moa violates many provisions of the constitution which strangely enough the memorandum never mentions by name
4394368 its impossible that government lawyers wont be able to answer questions about the moa since they prepared it
4394369 studies of mouse skin cancer have contributed little to our understanding of human skin cancer
4394370 extrapolation between the species for this aspect of biology is simply not warranted
4394371 further studies are needed to determine the effects of the widespread use of moisturising creams on the risk of sunlight induced skin cancer in humans

4394376 sadly again in the last few days there have been a number of suspected heroin overdoses
4394377 to our knowledge there have been eight since august 10 and sadly four of those persons did not recover and died as a result
4394378 it could be there is a harmful item in it that has reacted to them or it could be the quality of the heroin
4394379 denk eraan als je de machine niet kunt vertrouwen is het verstandiger om je logingegevens niet in te voeren dit is geen suggestie dat publieke computers de schuld voor wachtwoordstelers horen te krijgen maar ze bieden een mogelijkheid voor aanvallen om vele accounts te compromitteren

4394384 we are delighted that the minister has recognised the importance of what norwood is doing to assist people with learning difficulties to lead more fulfilling lives
4394385 high quality training which supports individuals into employment as well as accommodation which enables adults with learning disabilities to live much more independently
4394386 norwood should be proud that it is at the cutting edge of service provision
4394387 i truly believe this runs the risk of becoming a very real problem
4394388 was interested to read your concerns about kabbalah and sfk and has made sure your letter has been brought to the attention of relevant policy officials however i should also explain that we neither endorse nor ban specific teaching methods or resources unless it is part of a national campaign for raising standards it is a matter for individual schools to determine how to organise the school day and what teaching methods to use
4394389 i am pleased to know that the matter has been passed on to relevant policy officials but the suggestion that it is a matter for individual schools to determine what teaching methods to use raises serious concerns especially where those methods may involve indoctrination
4394390 that sfk and the kabbalah centre are inextricably linked is indisputable that the kabbalah centre is on some cult watch lists in america is also fact that should surely trigger enough alarm bells to encourage policy officials to pull the plug i truly hope they will ensure they investigate thoroughly to appreciate what is at stake here and take appropriate action
4394391 i wrote it hoping it would be highly readable and would tell a very human story
4394392 but all the articles and reviews focus on broccoli it isnt about broccoli or about jogging to me it is much more a spiritual exercise connected with life
4394393 after surgery and chemotherapy i asked my oncologist for advice about what i should do to lead a healthy life and what precautions i could take to avoid a relapse
4394394 he told me lead your life normally well do cat scans at regular intervals and if your tumour comes back well detect it early
4394395 being a physician and a scientist did not protect me from cancer but it did allow me to go deep into research to get answers which i have used in the book i wish i had read this book when i was diagnosed i wish i had read it before
4394396 to protect myself that was the spirit in which i wrote it to protect
4394397 a recipe for a good life it is the best recipe to nourish life in every way if you want to live a fulfilling life a health promoting diet is absolutely essential as is some level of activity and managing your emotions so as to deal with the unavoidable stresses of life more graciously
4394398 if you begin to respect the life inside you you cant pour into your body burgers and fries and coke you just cant do it there is a sense of the preciousness of life from that also stems the need to exercise your body wants to walk and breathe clean air to swim if you start to listen to your body all kinds of things happen
4394399 healthier than the traditional ashkenazi diet but still not so good because there is a lot of fried food
4394400 combined with one of the highest rates of cardiac infarction and obesity
4394401 you can do it by example when you meet people who lead a very healthy lifestyle there is something very attractive about it
4394402 the most striking thing is that i am in much better health i feel much better

4394483 i have completed quite a few designs in trendsetter yarns using mitred squares mitre squares take garter stitch into amazingly wonderful and colourful creations by simply working colour stripes technique wise this teaches the basic of picking stitches and a simple decrease i also teach how to work ends into the wrong side of the garter keeping colour joins under control these designs vary from the mitre vee capelet to an a line coco jacket or the coco throw i teach this class by knitting a small purse
4394484 i design my classes to take knitters from the basics into either colour or texture textures are moss stitch to basket stitch bobbles amp bells to cables this helps new knitters to understand knitting count rows and stitches increase and decrease with bobbles working from both written instructions and graphs the quicker and more experiences knitters who are speeder will also work traveling stitches i apply this term to aran stitches when a cable needle is used to move knit stitches across reverse st st forming zig zags and diamond patterns
4394485 i love intarsia this is for the lovers of colour ready to step into an adventure this can also be called picture knitting using a length of yarn per area of colour unlike fairisle when the yarn is worked across the back of the knitting students will learn techniques from joining yarns colour joins without holes to following graphs we also cover the fairisle technique of carrying and weaving in the carried yarn as this same technique allows us to position our yarns for intarsia i use a lot of intarsia in my knitting kit collection learning the basic principles allow knitters into a whole new world

4394488 hes a lying criminal and i would hope he ends up going to jail one day for the things hes done

4394490 people who need to dump their aggression should go to the gym and do some bagwork not take it out on individual scinos scientologists i cannot emphasize enough that this behaviour works against us and for the church
4394491 tommy has been heavily fucked by the cult and i think he has a lot of justifiable anger
4394492 would eat two handfuls of glass shards if he thought it made some kind of point about how much scilons scientologists suck
4394493 to wake them up you cant be all kind and sweet cause theyll just think youre an sp
4394494 theyll block it out i get under their skin so well theyll have to think about what im saying
4394495 he knows the mindset the policies how a scientologist is conditioned to think and act and he knows what helped to disillusion him
4394496 they are really no different from the ku klux klan in terms of their masks and hatred and their jollies of riding horses around and harassing scientologists
4394497 theyre really cooperative they have a right to be here
4394498 brought billions 1 of his people to earth in dc 8 like spacecraft stacked them around volcanoes and killed them using hydrogen bombs scientology holds that the essences of these many people remained and that they form around people in modern times causing them spiritual harm 2 3 members of the church of scientology widely deny or try to hide the xenu story

4394505 i think we have to look on it as the kick we needed
4394506 we are still in the game and we will have a good chance at anfield we all know we have to perform better and we will
4394507 the only good thing about that game for us was the 0 0 scoreline we were all very disappointed by the performance we gave as players and as a team we tried to do our best and it was not good enough
4394508 but hes our player and he wanted to play in the game and we think hes mentally tuned into it so thats all that matters
4394509 pepes probably one of the best at penalty saves and youve got to be really confident when hes up against one because of his record
4394510 it was a harsh decision though but then again ive heard that the other one was over the line so maybe theyve cancelled each other out
4394511 we know we didnt play as well as we can and they did well so we have to be pleased to get out of it with a nil nil
4394512 we probably didnt deserve it but thats football and over the years weve always seemed to find these kind of games difficult but gone on to do well and hopefully this time it will be the same
4394513 theres an old saying in tennessee i know its in texas probably in tennessee that says fool me once shame on shame on you fool me you cant get fooled again
4394514 light unites us all in that it makes all life possible
4394515 one of the big parts of the brief was to connect the bomb site to the garden in both ways and the sunlight is a beautiful way to do that
4394516 the approach to the artwork was that it could remember and honour the victims and offer something to the community by attempting to simply and vividly express the enormity of the loss and the natural feeling and the outpouring of compassion for them
4394517 then suddenly i realised it was suitable for omagh we had to prove we could do it and that it was thought through i really really believe in it i even find myself moved just talking about it
4394518 this image of the heart was hard fought for but i think its a really wonderful thing to put a symbol of love at that point which is in lots of ways a symbol of a terrible kind of suffering and verging on evil to be honest
4394519 there had been so much misery i think we had to bring a certain lightness and something positive and move forward but apart from that we are very intent in making what was once a scene of terrible tragedy into as beautiful an area as possible
4394520 i knew the importance of it and i knew it would be under a great deal of scrutiny and i knew that there were an awful lot of constituencies to please with it
4394521 and beyond it simply being adequate i wanted it to be really marvellous not least because i wanted it to be something redeeming and positive for the victims for the community at large and for omagh in particular
4394522 it is a memorial primarily but it has to answer to the future i think this is a lifes work it is probably the most important thing i will ever do
4394523 an opportunity for the bereaved the injured the emergency and support services and all of those affected by the bomb to come together with the wider community in an act of remembrance
4394524 we went close last season and people are tipping us for title this time which is nice but i dont think you can write linfield off
4394525 it definitely does put pressure on you when that happens but we know the way we finished the season and we have to take a lot of confidence from that
4394526 we were the form team in the second half of the season and we need to reproduce that form if we are going to have any chance of winning the league
4394527 to lose the league and to go out of the irish cup was a major disappointment for us and we have to use that as motivation this time round to try to go one better in both competitions
4394528 we were unbeaten from new years day onwards which was fantastic thats the sort of form you need to be in to win the league
4394529 we know that its going to be tough and there is going to be pressure involved and lets hope that the players can stand up and be counted
4394530 daryl fordyce is going to be one of the stars of the league i hope
4394531 he has had a great pre season and has learned from last year when he was just new to the irish league
4394532 he is not the only young player who is pushing for a place in the first team and hopefully they can learn from last year and be even better
4394533 we have closed the gap which is nice but it would be nicer to win it and i am hungry for more league titles
4394534 ive won the league three times and the irish cup three times but it is not enough for me
4394535 some of the other family i think will go to the memorial on the 15th but i cant guarantee i will go
4394536 i have to see how i feel on the day
4394537 i was never past the spot where the bomb was i ignore that part of the town
4394538 the whole thing just changed in a day one minute everything is right then the next everything is in turmoil memories are vague at that
4394539 no words could describe the feeling of helplessness that set in as we watched and waited for the car to return
4394540 she loved children and she only saw good in any child i think avril had the same touch with children
4394541 nothing will change the situation there is no point in dwelling i just have to get on with my life and carry on
4394542 the response was very much a human response not so much a sectarian one
4394543 omagh was always distinctive in that there was very little rank sectarianism here and it didnt allow itself to be divided there is a good respect for each others traditions and an acceptance that we should work together on common projects
4394544 the words were using is that the schools would co operate collaborate and be inter dependent this is a positive and creative vision
4394545 there would be cross community sharing between all the different schools the beauty of it is that there is a surge of interest and a quiet excitement about the possibilities
4394546 an inspirational beacon to the world in respect of conflict transformation
4394547 theres optimism around young people are positive and forward looking
4394548 if it could become a model for the type of northern ireland we want to build something good will have come of this
4394549 everybody has their way of coping and my way of coping is to get on with it
4394550 there has rarely been a week when there hasnt been some development relating to the bomb so its very much an ongoing atrocity its not going to disappear in this generation but above all we have amazingly resilient people
4394551 though our hearts are still breaking we must try to smile
4394552 they are waiting to greet us at the end of the mile
4394553 i would do anything to be able to go back and carry on my life like it was on august 14 1998
4394554 i wanted justice and to get some resolution here we are on the 10th anniversary and we are still as far away as ever
4394555 i felt the best people to talk about those who lost loved ones were the families themselves
4394556 politicians use air time in order to promote their own brand of politics
4394557 i think initially i did attempt to go back to work but i found it too difficult
4394558 i am not interested in what people outside of windsor park think and neither are my players
4394559 people are determined to knock us and question us but we will always answer them on the pitch
4394560 what we have achieved over the last few years has been phenomenal we have created history and that cant be forgotten
4394561 i dont think we have got anything like the praise we deserve for that and there are many many people out there who want to see us fail
4394562 there is an insatiable appetite to win inside our dressing room
4394563 there is no doubt that with a 12 team league and other teams strengthening their squad that trying to win the league this season will be one of our biggest challenges but we are ready
4394564 i have no doubts about my squad but i would like to add to it
4394565 i would like two or three more players in and if we can do that before august 31 then happy days
4394566 robbie white has come in he has shown enough to warrant an opportunity we wanted kevin kelbie but we were told he wouldnt be leaving and that there would be no permission to speak to him
4394567 no stone would be left unturned until we bring these people to justice
4394568 it is in the interests of everyone that those responsible for this terrible atrocity are brought to justice it may never happen we may never know now it may be too late to establish guilt
4394569 the right to know that a full unfettered investigation had occurred
4394570 there needs to be organisational and cultural change which offers better integration more cohesive working and a positive strategic approach to intelligence management
4394571 i saw a woman sitting in the middle of the wreckage i saw that her right leg was blown apart around the knee area
4394572 the lower part of her right leg was still attached there was not much blood as the flesh and bone looked to be partly cooked
4394573 the first game against sheffield wednesday didnt go according to plan
4394574 we were back in training working hard on monday and i think that showed against bury
4394575 you have to work hard first and do the things on the training field
4394576 there will be times when i dont score and times when i will
4394577 its all about working hard and being a good professional
4394578 to me that more important than scoring goals and thats what i try to do
4394579 we are determined to put things right and kick on with the season
4394580 i think people have read too much into the start of the season but were still ready to go and attack the championship and im delighted with how its gone
4394581 i hope the cup win can be the catalyst for our season now
4394582 ipswich will be a tough game they have brought some great players in and weve got to do more than compete on saturday weve got to look to win
4394583 people see that you have score two goals and you get all the praise but i think out back four and midfield defended brilliantly because it wasnt an easy game
4394584 i think the back four deserve a pat on the back more than me
4394585 finding funding for rallying at the moment is virtually impossible
4394586 it is an expensive sport and companies find it hard to justify pouring money into sponsorship when they may be faced with laying people off
4394587 my tarmac title may have gone but i was hoping to finish the season by doing the final two rounds the ulster and the cork 20 to set myself up for next season but the current economic situation makes that impossible
4394588 it is disappointing especially after we had made such good progress with the skoda in donegal but i have had to be sensible and accept that the funding just isnt in place
4394589 sometimes going back to a club where you were a hero can work against you
4394590 you cant just go back to where you left off because there is years of a gap there
4394591 coming back here it is a different team a different set up and the way the game is played now is different the game has moved on
4394592 tony will do alright he has the right attitude and if we can get players in around him he will score goals and create them too
4394593 tony has come back and shown a super professional attitude
4394594 he leads by example in his training and the effort that he is putting in and i think other players are seeing it and are responding to it
4394595 he is fit hes hungry for it and he goes quietly about his business on and off the park and works very hard too
4394596 he is an experienced pro other players watch and learn from him and he sets examples
4394597 i am very very pleased with him so far and i believe there is more to come from him
4394598 we know it is going to be tough but i think its best off that we have arsenal in the first game
4394599 at least we will know what we are up against right from the very start and we have to be on our game straight away
4394600 it is better that we will get an idea of the level of the top teams in the first week rather than having to wait until a couple of months into the season before playing any of the title contenders and then being off the pace
4394601 we played portsmouth in the fa cup semi final and we werent outplayed
4394602 we were as good as them and i think at times we played better football than they did
4394603 we just lacked a bit of quality in the final third and they got a bit lucky with the goal that won it for them
4394604 there wasnt that much difference between us but they didnt allow us too many chances and we know that teams in the premier league will be like that all through this season
4394605 we have been a yo yo club over the last few years and that is something that the players want to get rid of
4394606 customers are telling us this is the time of the month theyre really starting to feel the pinch and thats why were investing in price cuts where they really count on everyday essentials like milk bread and butter meat and vegetables
4394607 despite clear inflation in some food products we have worked hard to cut our prices
4394608 we have a significant number of promotions at the moment to help customers which are across the store
4394609 he did not uphold it and therefore is has been dismissed
4394610 i believe that with each and every inquiry my integrity and character is being upheld
4394611 no constitutional role for the prime minister to reprimand individual members of parliament who are accountable to their electorate for their own comments
4394612 equal inclusive society in northern ireland where everyone is treated with respect and where opportunity for all remains a priority
4394613 the commissioners remit does not cover an mps views or opinions

4394655 when the human genome scan got underway in 1990 critics pointed out that given the speed with which the genome could then be scanned it would take thousands of years to finish the project yet the fifteen year project was completely slightly ahead of schedule with a first draft in 2003
4394656 yeah but im sure they had some good reason for designing it the way it is so its probably better just to leave it as is
4394657 two years ago the economist narrowly favoured mr kerrys incoherence over mr bushs incompetence since then republican incompetence has exceeded even our worst fears how depressing to report that democratic incoherence has soared too america deserves better

4394672 the united states took in fewer than 1 000 iraqi refugees sweden took in 40 000 and you know they didnt start the war so the question for an american viewing audience to consider is whether or not we have a special responsibility to deal with people who cannot and believe me are not going home
4394673 a lot of them are people who went to work for american contractors for the military now they cant go home because theyre dead if they go home its pretty simple
4394674 when you do television you have this kind of mythical belief that the people sitting at home are fully dressed sober and paying attention and taking notes

4394676 the cw has no deal with tori spelling to appear on 90210 at this time

4394696 our effort at increasing investment in rural areas and reducing the debt burden of farmers has turned our agricultural economy around

4394710 the people here are hardly representative of the body politic and are certainly not representative of the body politic who reside at 1600 pennsylvania avenue

4394722 enceladus was streaking across the sky so quickly that the spacecraft had no hope of tracking any feature on its surface
4394723 our best option was to point the spacecraft far ahead of enceladus spin the spacecraft and camera as fast as possible in the direction of enceladus predicted path and let enceladus overtake us at a time when we could match its motion across the sky snapping images along the way

4394753 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4394754 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4394755 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4394756 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4394757 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil

4394776 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4394777 we have seen the total motorcycle participation in vehicle miles traveled go up
4394778 we might see more people moving to that mode of transportation
4394779 its a reassertion of the age old russian ambitions and desires for the russian empire and the so called near abroad
4394780 i really hesitate to talk about a military option at this time because i think that would escalate rather than de escalate what we want to see achieved here
4394781 theres plenty of time in the future depending on russias behavior there and in the region to talk about the other options
4394782 i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party

4394784 vestas expects it will take some years before supply will match demand even with the increasing number of manufacturers and sub suppliers especially from china
4394785 vestas is very well positioned in the multi megawatt turbine market vestas flagship v 90 turbine is the industry benchmark in this class and is a tremendous competitive advantage
4394786 as the trend towards these larger utility scale turbines increases vestas dominant position should benefit the company

4394792 it will have the same effect the guy will die
4394793 i think the whole thing is more of symbolic importance
4394794 its establishing a presence showing the flag and challenging the expansion of russian power in that country
4394795 the united states government then will turn to questions of both economic reconstruction and also what to do to help the georgian security forces looking to the longer term future
4394796 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4394797 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4394798 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4394799 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4394800 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4394801 i love the bowl games i like the fact that kids get a chance to be rewarded for having a great year and going 8 4 and 7 5 i would be crushed if the bowl games somehow some way were eliminated over the next six eight 10 years
4394802 there would have been a fair amount of support for the plus one model among acc presidents swofford said adding he didnt know whether those supporters would have made up the majority
4394803 if there are no more than one or two undefeated teams theres no purpose to going to a playoff with 12 games its tough to go undefeated so youre playing for the national championship from the first game on
4394804 they were undefeated with a great football team a team that deserved to have a chance to win the national championship and they got shut out he said
4394805 if youre getting it right 97 percent of the time the other 3 percent which happened to us the year we didnt get a chance to play oklahoma nobody should get a chance to complain more than me
4394806 but i still believe that what were doing now is probably better than taking the eight best schools then everybody else youre done for the year

4394812 the lessons of kosovo are clear not only should israel join russia canada china spain romania and many others in refusing to recognize kosovo it should also state that as a consequence of kosovos independence israel rejects the deployment of any international forces to gaza or judea and samaria and refuses to cede its legal right to sovereignty in judea samaria gaza and jerusalem to international arbitration
4394813 its emotionally engaging in a different way and makes us stand out from other competitors on the high street
4394814 his primary commitment was to his family his eight wonderful children and his grandchildren
4394815 the state of louisiana is prepared to go to trial and will object to any continuances
4394816 there were about six or seven different things i asked about the program today ive been informed of one of those things happening
4394817 its been 120 days as of aug 22 some things take time but thats been a long time for me
4394818 the main focus is to enhance the facilities of our campus and to provide our students with up to date technology
4394819 it went up in flames in at least three or four minutes
4394820 i saw him about 4 30 that afternoon and hadnt seen him since
4394821 the really big presence is yet to come in the next year or so there will be two or three times the number of wells
4394822 it is possibly the fourth largest gas discovery in the world and the largest in the united states
4394823 the shale lays like blankets flat blankets of geologic formations on top of each other
4394824 you go down 12 000 feet on average make a right angle and go another 3 000 to 4 000 feet its incredible technology
4394825 probably by the end of the year there will be 100 and by the end of next year 200 thats an incredible amount of activity
4394826 i understand that we dont look for a bottom line profit like a business does but once again is this serving the greatest quantity of people for the least amount of money obviously the answer to that is no
4394827 do we want to put three or four people on a 40 foot bus that burns a ton of diesel or can we find some alternative ways to provide them with the same kind of transportation at less cost to lcg
4394828 we have this question come up on a regular basis
4394829 we have looked at tried to explore and understand what other communities have done we would be happy to discuss that issue with you
4394830 its a vile place unfortunately it is not a pretty site
4394831 thats what weve talked about with the clerk of court and other occupants of that building
4394832 the occupants of the buchanan garage have been receptive to making the vermilion garage more functional weve talked about a shuttle a wellness and exercise program to promote walking all of thats on the table
4394833 we are committed to making this happen this year its going to require a tremendous amount of work
4394834 theyre still going to fight theyre still going to fight for years to come
4394835 theyve still got cockfighting in every state they just hide it from the law
4394836 cockfighting may still be going on with much smaller venues in the back woods but my understanding is there hasnt been any big activity since the gambling ban
4394837 can you imagine putting a man in jail taking him away from his family and job because what he used to do to support his family is now illegal
4394838 i am so sad to see a multi million dollar industry in an economically depressed place like st landry just ripped out of our culture and out of out economy
4394839 louisiana has too much potential to build their economy on activities such as cockfighting
4394840 were losing out on an opportunity to keep our heritage and our culture
4394841 take the value pack the pack without movies and sports and get the sports channels free until 30 9

4394857 elitist perspective of literary critics and the theoretical blindfolds that have stultified debate on the left
4394858 like a child who has had a toy snatched from its hand
4394859 too sympathetic to the so called black armband view of australian history
4394860 a beacon of free and sceptical thought against fashionable leftists

4394868 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4394869 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4394870 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4394871 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4394872 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4394873 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4394874 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4394875 then why all the rush to interpolated 120hz 100hz pal for home movie display
4394876 live big screen video using hand held cameras would be inadequate at 48p
4394877 is that why they all walk out on 60 hz hdtv oh wait they dont
4394878 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
4394879 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
4394880 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day
4394881 flicker is noticed more with computer displays due to the white sheet of paper model flat white areas appear to flicker more than dark
4394882 another movie he directed brainstorm was originally designed to highlight a projection technology he was promoting the movie was about recording experiences in the film the recorded experiences were going to be played at 48 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames per second his feeling was that audiences had gotten used to the look of standard film people were subliminally aware of the 24 frame per second flicker by projecting the film at twice the standard rate the flicker was harder to perceive and the film would be given that much more immediacy however it was impossible to convince the theater owners to install the special projectors to show the recorded experience sequences the movie was released as a conventional film fortunately the story stood up well on its own partly correct showscan runs at 60fps when he was doing test work for 2001 i believe it was on the spacewalk footage but its been years since i read up on the process and things have blurred for me he accidentally ran a sequence at 60fps and the uniform reaction in the booth was shock that hed gotten a 3d effect with a conventional camera he did dream up brainstorm to use the process but the studio hed been working with didnt want to install the only projector on the market that would run 60fps for an extended period without breaking for just one film and he ended up taking the story idea with him to mgm as i remember it he had to do a sizable payout to get it from his previous studio even then mgm wouldnt go for it compare and contrast with the ua chain which installed a highly sophisticated 3d system in a number of their theaters including seattle and ended up offering a couple of million dollars as a bounty to get someone anyone to shoot a feature using it there were several showscan shorts shot the one at expo 86 the one on magic tricks starring christopher lee and it looked like hed finally get them in widespread distribution when he signed a deal with a major restaurant chain to add a showscan theater to each of their restaurants but the chain was chuck e cheese and the deal was about two months before they imploded of all the reviews i read about the process the one that stuck with me was the one in cinefantastique that said makeup technology was going to have to improve greatly if the process was going to catch on you could apparently see every pore on christopher lees face
4394883 i knew i just had to go out and do my normal routine thats what my dad kept saying dont do anything better than you know how to do dont do anything worse just go out and do it normal
4394884 a little bit but i cant control anyone but me so theres no reason to get nervous for other people hoping ill do better than them i knew that if i went out there today and hit my routines the way i was hoping to and the way ive been training i had a good chance
4394885 i think this makes it a little sweeter just knowing ive been through some pretty big injuries and some doubters but honestly i think it made me so much stronger and it made me the person that i am today
4394886 its definitely been a long journey but every single moment has been worth it
4394887 i knew i had to go out there and go all out and not hold anything back
4394888 its definitely been a dream come true for both of us hes worked just as hard as i have just being with me in the gym every single day traveling with me all over the world i could not be more thankful
4394889 my mom too she plays a huge role i havent talked to her yet im not sure if she was here watching but i texted her so she knows
4394890 shes the moral support side of it for both my dad and me when things get hot at the gym shes always there to calm us down
4394891 it makes it even more amazing knowing that exactly 20 years ago my dad competed at the 88 olympics he was so close to winning that all around gold medal less than a tenth away just standing there on that podium thinking about that i hoped that i made up for that and i hope he feels just as proud as i am of it
4394892 well obviously shes an athlete and shes a great athlete its not easy to be second but we did make some mistakes and we were ready at that time
4394893 i went up there and give it my heart and soul but nastias been around a while she has a lot of experience and she deserved that gold today

4394901 at this point it is hard to see why anyone would stick their neck out for general musharraf
4394902 i am celebrating our independence which i feel is near
4394903 consent must be obtained for any use of the plant property
4394904 in case they want to put up a little tesla sign on the freeway
4394905 aggressively pursuing the opportunity to bring tesla to san jose
4394906 fortunately no one was seriously injured by these violent acts
4394907 however i fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt or even killed because of the research they perform or merely because they live in the same home as one of the targets
4394908 uc researchers and staff along with their spouses and children live in daily fear for their safety
4394909 the escalation of violence has grown at an alarming rate
4394910 we got him in to the hut and got him comfortable but i think it happened pretty fast
4394911 i saw smoke and i smelled the very bad smell of burned flesh and blood
4394912 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato
4394913 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4394914 its a reassertion of the age old russian ambitions and desires for the russian empire and the so called near abroad
4394915 i really hesitate to talk about a military option at this time because i think that would escalate rather than de escalate what we want to see achieved here
4394916 theres plenty of time in the future depending on russias behavior there and in the region to talk about the other options
4394917 i think he used the issue of iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party
4394918 they liked hot cars they were out looking for hot cars and when they saw one they carjacked it
4394919 if it doesnt go as they want they shoot with semiautomatic guns
4394920 were thrilled to be able to move forward with the site
4394921 in the absence of the type of public process we propose we believe that reuse planning might be mired in controversy undermining efforts to restore the hangar
4394922 we feel strongly that navys responsibilities for hangar one also include re covering the hangars structural steel skeleton
4394923 the time has come to look beyond the issue of re skinning and plan for the future reuse of the hangar
4394924 we have been told repeatedly by our representatives in washington that its hard to find money to preserve the hangar if there is no reuse plan
4394925 furthermore restoration and upgrading for reuse bathrooms lighting fire protection could be integrated into one construction project to save money
4394926 while recovery is lengthy and a pain in the neck i might point out i am doing well i am walking and have even answered a couple of e mails but i am mostly immobile basically waiting for five hunks of bone to fuse into one its like watching grass grow only slower the upside i may be slightly taller
4394927 quite frankly the officers did an outstanding job in this case
4394928 the officers were operating on their experience and training and brought this to a successful resolution without injury to anyone
4394929 we were being very focused on data and targeting students who needed the extra push
4394930 we have seen the total motorcycle participation in vehicle miles traveled go up
4394931 we might see more people moving to that mode of transportation
4394932 these small ones you roast em in a little garlic and olive oil and theyre delicious
4394933 we never have to take the car to get fresh vegetables for dinner
4394934 i am convinced that honoring sen clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4394935 spread the word we will be enforcing this new law
4394936 obesity is a huge problem within our society and among children
4394937 we just feel that banning one type of restaurant is not the answer to a healthy california
4394938 i happen to like the mcdonalds salads and i dont think we should be telling our residents where they can and cannot eat
4394939 nobody has any idea what fast food is and how you define it
4394940 are we going to ban the taquerias chinese food places
4394941 a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
4394942 when you talk about fast food restaurants youre thinking burgers and fries and chips and pizza
4394943 its important to keep things healthy but we also have to have choice when we have ordinances that limit businesses it sets a precedent that sometimes has wide ranging effects
4394944 i think people sometimes think we have to do something to make ourselves feel good regardless of whether it will have any effect
4394945 no matter how many fast food restaurants the city manages to keep out kids are going to find it somewhere
4394946 this worrying trend highlights the need to provide racially diverse and low income communities with healthier eating options and to take steps to curtail the increase in high fat low nutrition options like fast food
4394947 it is astounding that after admitting to each and every charge and allegation the defendant now denies culpability
4394948 i never told anyone i was inheriting any money there is nobody to support
4394949 we all really wanted him to be real hes a liar thats the thing he tells such big stories most liars dont go that big thats what hes good at
4394950 he was mad because i did not want to deal with him
4394951 i was looking for the building and mosher was sitting back letting it all go
4394952 two years ago for a case that had no merit
4394953 we have no idea what theyre doing there why the movement where theyre going
4394954 one explanation could be they are trying to rattle the civilian population
4394955 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4394956 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state

4394976 its important to have creative online sportsbook copy business insurance
4394977 because one needs to dodge frivalous law suits and liabilities
4394978 lets get this creative online sportsbook copy project underway and take cues from www mpaa org as needed
4394979 most insurance adjusters will visit an online creative online sportsbook copy business anonymously so they can get an idea of how the website operates
4394980 im happy to introduce limehouse bueter our new head of logistics and transportation
4394981 because with nearly every copy sold the author is rich
4394982 law educationm particularly in the creative online sportsbook copy field is changing every day
4394983 they act as a point of liaison for the canadian sport community by providing expertise in the areas of major games and sport co ordinate bilateral meetings with other countries provide technical expertise and advice to the ministerial delegations and are the point of contact back to federal departments that may be needed for crisis and communications management
4394984 actual costs will be known once the games are completed and once all expenses have been calculated
4394985 observer programs where best practices could be shared on essential services provided by a games host
4394986 were no shrinking violet on that issue but we dont choose to use the olympics to make that point
4394987 how do you simulate something when the conditions are entirely different
4394988 understand the dynamics of what would cause the accident the way it did
4394989 we didnt think that was as important because when the accident happened both vessels had entered a pool of open water
4394990 we are convinced that there were lookouts on the quarter deck of the sir william alexander at the time of accident
4394991 as theyre watching the whales the commercial vessel plowed right through
4394992 his explanation was that in his home of origin there are stories of whales capsizing boats
4394993 im quite pleased that this incident went to court and a conviction was handed down
4394994 dfo has put a lot of effort forward with species at risk to identify threats and mitigate those incidents
4394995 the attorney general asks that the appeal be heard as soon as there is available time to hear it
4394996 the implications are significant what were talking about is an order declaring an important law of no force and effect
4394997 the government should be doing their work as we speak
4394998 the civil liberties association like the plaintiffs themselves is responding to what in essence is a health care crisis in the downtown eastside
4394999 the principal investigators incorporated this project into their personal research programs
4395000 its being done a bit as a spinoff from our research funding
4395001 the main proposal that we wrote didnt get funded so whats happening is that bits and pieces are going ahead
4395002 his bosses didnt really understand the importance of this after a while they slowly grasped its importance
4395003 honestly it happened very slowly because with the government it gets very political this kind of thing there were a lot of american business people and agencies that wanted to do the same research and robert always turned them down because he wanted it to have some canadian content
4395004 canada has a very strong brand in the international community so i discovered theres a lot of support for us theres more work to be done obviously
4395005 its a record that has gone over the radio before
4395006 its something that we sort of live with in canada because of the nature of the sports that we generally excel at theyre second week sports so its always frustrating for those who are watching whether back in canada or here for the games to see us not winning as many medals as we would like in the first week
4395007 so is the rest of the world weve got to keep reaching higher
4395008 i thought we might get some medals yet we did break 18 canadian records it shows you the kind of challenges were facing
4395009 its why we keep pushing for more investment in sport and why the pan american bid is so important

4395013 mau nonton liga inggris live saksikan hanya di aoratv com namun sayangnya belum ada konfirmasi dari pihak aora mengenai cara berlangganan
4395014 sebagai konsumen dan pencinta tayangan liga inggris tentunya sangat kecewa dengan keputusan yang terjadi astro malaysia sebagai pemegang hak siar liga inggris untuk indonesia juga tidak profesional karena keputusan pindahnya siaran liga inggris yang sekarang disebut sebut jatuh ketangan provider baru dilakukan tanpa pemberitahuan
4395015 alasan gue pilih astro adalah liga inggris karena yang lainnya bisa didapat dari provider yang berbeda jadi ya saya akan pindah ke aora ini menurut saya adalah permainan politik perusahaan yang berakibat buruk terhadap konsumen
4395016 saya baru tiga hari ini berlangganan astro karena mau nonton liga inggris tapi pengelola astro sungguh tidaka profesional dan tidak menjelaskan kepada calon pelanggannya mengenai situasi siaran langsung liga inggris

4395019 if he were here he would tell us to not forget what were about and thats taking care of the people
4395020 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4395021 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4395022 he was pretty blunt but always had something good to say even if it was something someone didnt like on the other side

4395031 sterling is being hit on all sides at the moment with a broad based dollar rebound and the realisation that the uk economy is facing a very difficult period
4395032 this is a softer approach we have already notified several key countries about the theoretical and practical aspects of execution and most feel it should be doable
4395033 we hope that china wont block this approach and that their leaders will finally understand the hopes of taiwans 23 million people for entering global organisations
4395034 especially with the hawaii economy and whats transpired in the past few months with the big companies making a lot of layoffs
4395035 in january thats the telling month that well see what we have to do
4395036 where we have to cut back in the food service budget
4395037 this is like an all time high back in july of over 35 000 participants we also noticed some of the layoffs that some of the companies are doing so we anticipate an ever more increasing case load for the rest of the year
4395038 in order to offset some of the costs we are cutting back on certain items
4395039 not the food per se but the type of foods were offering
4395040 we are concerned about budget so that we can keep serving our current caseload and the anticipated increase so we need to watch our food dollars

4395062 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4395063 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution

4395096 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4395097 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4395098 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4395099 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4395100 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end

4395109 we have seen a 75 percent increase in calls to our hotline since the start of advertising the number through kaka nijat this year
4395110 people usually call to inform police about explosions and suicide bombings
4395111 we are trying to encourage the people to help the security forces in the fight against terrorists who are using islam as a tool for their purposes
4395112 he teaches us how to call police when we see bad people

4395119 thanks to the help of aid workers like these real progress has been made in improving the lives of the afghan people
4395120 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4395121 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation
4395122 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
4395123 many thousands of children are alive today thanks to aid work on improving health standards six million children are now in education two million of them girls compared to one million boys with girls banned from schools under the taliban
4395124 in contrast the insurgents have nothing to offer the afghan people other than more killings and intimidation
4395125 cast a shadow over our efforts to normalise ties with pakistan
4395126 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated

4395128 we dont know what equipment they have whether anyone is injured we dont even know whether the signal being put out is coming from these climbers or another group or individual
4395129 we had a brief break in the weather earlier today which allowed us to hone in on the beacon but it closed in again soon after and the rescuers had to turn back
4395130 we now have a general idea where the signal is coming from and that will hasten the process tomorrow but with something like this the signal pings off all the mountains and it takes a bit of time to triangulate the location
4395131 stands ready to provide consular assistance to any australians in need
4395132 there are a number of groups climbing including a group of six australians so at this stage it is not clear which party triggered the rescue beacon
4395133 it may be that we dont get in to have a look for them until tomorrow
4395134 we have search and rescue teams on standby but there is always an avalanche risk
4395135 there are a number of groups climbing including a group of six australians so at this stage it is not clear which party triggered the rescue beacon

4395138 well firstly the banks have recently had the benefit of a 20 to 30 basis point cut effectively in the price theyre paying for money in the first place
4395139 fortunately no one was seriously injured by these violent acts
4395140 however i fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt or even killed because of the research they perform or merely because they live in the same home as one of the targets
4395141 uc researchers and staff along with their spouses and children live in daily fear for their safety
4395142 the escalation of violence has grown at an alarming rate

4395149 in the absence of the type of public process we propose we believe that reuse planning might be mired in controversy undermining efforts to restore the hangar
4395150 we feel strongly that navys responsibilities for hangar one also include re covering the hangars structural steel skeleton
4395151 the time has come to look beyond the issue of re skinning and plan for the future reuse of the hangar
4395152 we have been told repeatedly by our representatives in washington that its hard to find money to preserve the hangar if there is no reuse plan
4395153 furthermore restoration and upgrading for reuse bathrooms lighting fire protection could be integrated into one construction project to save money
4395154 obesity is a huge problem within our society and among children
4395155 we just feel that banning one type of restaurant is not the answer to a healthy california

4395157 nobody has any idea what fast food is and how you define it
4395158 are we going to ban the taquerias chinese food places
4395159 a limited menu items prepared in advance or prepared or heated quickly no table orders and food served in disposable wrapping or containers
4395160 when you talk about fast food restaurants youre thinking burgers and fries and chips and pizza
4395161 its important to keep things healthy but we also have to have choice when we have ordinances that limit businesses it sets a precedent that sometimes has wide ranging effects
4395162 i think people sometimes think we have to do something to make ourselves feel good regardless of whether it will have any effect
4395163 no matter how many fast food restaurants the city manages to keep out kids are going to find it somewhere
4395164 this worrying trend highlights the need to provide racially diverse and low income communities with healthier eating options and to take steps to curtail the increase in high fat low nutrition options like fast food
4395165 it is astounding that after admitting to each and every charge and allegation the defendant now denies culpability
4395166 i never told anyone i was inheriting any money there is nobody to support

4395180 these arrests and subsequent searches of the nearby premises will be conducted with sensitivity and carried out as quickly as possible to ensure minimum impact on the three areas concerned
4395181 however these types of inquiries can be complex and may take time to resolve
4395182 i would ask local residents to be patient with us and to be assured that we will keep them updated in relation to the investigation as and when we can

4395262 this combination of mounting new listings and fading sales has pushed the market into buyers territory in many cities rapidly undercutting pricing power

4395290 its very very difficult with the roads that are here and the number of people trying to get here
4395291 the day early opening has taken a lot of those vehicles away they are already here and they have already had a good night and avoid sitting in any queues
4395292 so hopefully next year more people will take us up on that

4395295 human settlement around the black sea has a delicate complex geology accumulated over three thousand years but a geologist would not call this process simple sedimentation as if each new influx of settlers neatly overlaid the previous culture instead the heat of history has melted and folded peoples into one anothers crevices in unpredictable outcrops and striations every town and village is seamed with fault lines every district displays a different veining of ethnicities and people
4395296 an ancient multi ethnic community is a rich culture to grow up in bosnia was once like that so was odessa before the bolshevik revolution or vilnius in lithuania before the second world war but nostalgia makes bad history the symbiosis has often been more apparent than real living together does not mean growing together different ethnic groups may co exist for centuries practicing the borrowing and visiting of good neighbors sitting on the same school bench and serving in the same imperial regiments without losing their underlying mutual distrust but what held such societies together was not so much consent as necessity the fear of external force for one group to assail or attempt to suppress another was to invite a catastrophic intervention from above the dispatch of turkish soldiers or cossacks which would pitch the whole community into disaster it follows that when that fear is removed through the collapse of empires or tyrannies the constraint is removed too power struggles in distant places to which one group or another feels an allegiance reach the village street democratic politics summoning unsophisticated people to pick up sides and to think in terms of adversarial competition smite such communities along their concealed splitting plane their ethnic divisions and often reluctantly at first they divide the familiar neighbors with their odd smelling food and the strange language they speak at home become part of an alien and hostile them antique suspicions once confined to folk songs and the kitchen tales of grandmothers are synthesized into the politics of paranoia all multi ethnic landscapes in other words are fragile any serious tremor may disrupt them setting of landslips earthquakes and eruptions of blood the peoples themselves know this and fear it
4395297 the ferghana valley borderlands were once a dynamic and intricate mosaic of ethnic groups kinship networks land use patterns and economic activity recent border policies of ferghana valley states have shattered that mosaic
4395298 in the ferghana valley we have a multitude of craftsmen but we have no tourists
4395299 business is the driver behind the survival of traditional crafts
4395300 if craftsmen can only sell two or three pieces of their work then interest is lost and the craft disappears
4395301 if the soviet union had lasted twenty more years the knowledge of crafts would have disappeared altogether
4395302 we werent happy to start this traditional work again but we had no choice
4395303 look its not my fault here im juz as gd as them its juz that the system favours them not me

4395306 1895 a naqshbandi ishan from andijan ismail khan tore was arrested in aulie ata where he was collecting funds to finance the holy war three years later may 18 1898 it was again in andijan that a revolt broke out which spread immediately to the districts of osh namangan and marghilan leading it once again was an ishan of the sufi brotherhood of the naqshbandi
4395307 the collapse was good now there are incentives for hard work for business and building
4395308 at the end of the nineteenth century german biblical scholar and linguist j g weitzstein 1815 1905 traveled to a monastery near damascus where he found jobs tomb his well and the stone on which he sat on his dung heap he also found several petrified rocks about which he tells us this while these people were offering up their aur afternoon prayers in this place sad brought me a handful of small round stones which tradition declares to be the worms that fell to the ground from jobs sores petrified

4395311 people may be going through a break up or they are suffering depression they may be vulnerable to these sorts of things she said
4395312 the evidence is that credit card default is related to unemployment illness and family breakdown not bank marketing he said in a statement
4395313 the australian bankers association does not believe that there is a sound argument for credit card limit offers to be banned by government regulation
4395314 we found that lenders frame their letters in various ways to make it more likely customers will not really think too hard about taking on more debt and just accept the limit increase he said
4395315 the letters trigger the natural human instinct to trust experts in this case experts who have already determined you can afford a limit increase
4395316 we traveled freely around the ussr as a child i went to tashkent moscow probably the only problem with the soviet union
4395317 was that is was closed we didnt see much luxury but we felt secure in jobs and as persons
4395318 the ussr gave much to kyrgyzstan they gave us access to the world to world culture to literature science and technology they gave us the notion of statehood they gave us literacy this is why it makes no sense for us to tear down lenins statues this is why we can remember
4395319 of course there were many negatives which stemmed from the narrow policy of communist party leaders collectivization was brutal and unnecessary nationalists were also punished and suffocated but our crafts never stopped the embroidery the shyrdaks the kurak all continued
4395320 we wasted so much time and resources we were not business minded and didnt really understand the market we were entering we didnt know how to keep our production up to international standards we didnt know the basics like which colors would sell which sizes fit our biggest demand pool
4395321 basically the consultant taught us how to run our business
4395322 the early kyrgyz were children of nature they considered themselves as part of nature the sun moon mountains were intertwined in their lives they knew a cyclical time led by the equinox at kyrgyz heritage we have integrated this knowledge in the crafts we make today we incorporate the meaningful ornaments of the past
4395323 we have to deal with high mountainous conditions roads development everything is harder here compounded with constant earth quakes landslides this is eating at the state budget everything is more expensive in kyrgyzstan furthermore we are landlocked we have to pay for all our access we have to pay everyone
4395324 of course we the kyrgyz converted but we are modern
4395325 there is no support for the business community here especially the small business community the unstable political situation is hurting us its hurting our production lines women cant come to work if there are demos going on its hurting our demand as tourists dont want to travel to kyrgyzstan if there is political instability
4395326 we give them a chance to develop their skills to gain financial autonomy and respect within their families and the community
4395327 in our village making handicrafts is the only income generating activity that can be done while also staying at home and taking care of our families
4395328 in the history of modern international relations creation and development of
4395329 as regards foreign policy the heads of the sco emphasized that the modern world order must be based on the consolidation of mutual trust good neighbourhood relations the abandonment of monopoly and single rule on international affaires it must follow the prevalent status of principles and norms of the international law
4395330 its a lot different than 2004 when i came in as an 18 year old
4395331 now its all about business im not taking it lightly
4395332 i knew going into the trials it was going to be very tough to make the team i gave it my all it definitely helped the front end of my 200 i think in the end it will definitely pay off
4395333 we have a great rivalry this race is going to be more exciting than they all have been shell be rested weve been waiting for this for a long time shes the main challenge also the rest of the jamaicans as well its going to be a really great final
4395334 its a responsibility weve been given the opportunity to do what we love and have america look at us and bring some hope back to the sport maybe we can change the face of the sport
4395335 were excited about the position and ready to take it on
4395336 women became aggressive the woman had to face their children asking them where dinner was
4395337 it was the women who would hear their kids pangs of hunger not the dads faced with unemployment women became interested in crafts
4395338 this is when i had the idea to open something on my own i had so many doubts i was not sure how to combine art with business but under the strenuous economic circumstances and the surprising turns of life i had to do just that launch myself into this business
4395339 so many women looked to the past to see how they could earn money
4395340 today the disappearance of traditional cultural values is precipitating the extinction of traditional skills and expertise accumulated for ages handicrafts are becoming a rarity
4395341 people will continue to make traditional crafts and arts the future is dependent on the existence of a market for the goods
4395342 the early kyrgyz were children of nature they considered themselves as part of nature the sun moon mountains were intertwined in their lives they knew a cyclical time led by the equinox at kyrgyz heritage we have integrated this knowledge in the crafts we make today we incorporate the meaningful ornaments of the past
4395343 i am looking to integrate some traditional embroidery in the crafts we make for tourists to create a market for embroidery im sure it can work

4395345 communist chinas incorporation of xinjiang was an attempt to override historical and geographical divisions there within a short time space and to turn the region into an internal colony
4395346 the communist chinese government sought to fully incorporate xinjiang into its core political economy its goals therefore included shifting xinjiangs economic and geographic focus away from the west to diminish its trade with the soviet union and toward urumqi and the east urumqi was made the transportation hub toward which all roads of xinjiang were oriented this new highway network was of immense strategic value for the chinese however it was the westward extension of the railroad in 1962 from china proper to urumqi that had the greatest effect on xinjiang once the center of xinjiang shifted to urumqi the importance of the cities of kashgar and illi diminished
4395347 the pcc with a population of over 2 2 million in 1992 has been a major political force in maintaining chinese control of xinjiang by mid 1982 it had established over 170 state farms and had built 69 medium large factories by 1984 the pcc accounted for a quarter of the value of xinjiangs total production
4395348 the stability of xinjiang is important to china it is seen as a test case of central control relevant to beijings grip over tibet and inner mongolia xinjiang is also viewed as a traditional buffer against turkic moslem invasions from the north west the province also contains three major oil basins the turpan jungar and tarim with up to 150 billion barrels of reserves according to some optimistic estimates last but not least the peoples liberation army maintains numerous bases and nuclear weapons testing grounds in the region which could be threatened if the ouighurs gain control
4395349 the chinese words xi and ju meaning theatre performance describe a performance art which is made up of four basic performance skills chang singing nian recitation da military skills and acrobatics and zuo doing acting
4395350 jingju beijing opera is only one of over three hundred different styles of theatre in china and each is defined as a particular style by the type of melodic and or percussive structure each form reflects to a certain extent the geographical and cultural influences of a particular area of china
4395351 the nuo performance is based on the step known as the yu step which is a sequence of eight steps across the luo diagrm
4395352 stamping on the earth in the chinese model carries the meaning of suppressing evil spirits so the simplest interpretation of the yu step is that the performer ritually cleanses the stations of the grid by stamping his foot in each these movements place the foot and the earth into strong relation with each other not only does the stamping foot literally press down the demon it also calls forth a terrific force and an equally terrific sound the percussion orchestra in the nuo is a vital element of the performance
4395353 nuo performers adopt elements which refer to their ancestors they perform with the presence of their exorcist creative ancestors represented in their apparel
4395354 on november 26 1948 after the founding of the prc the ministry of culture issued a directive to artists and writers about the importance and possible use in a new era of muban nianhua nianhua is one of the most popular types of chinese folk art under the feudal rule in the past it was employed as a vehicle to spread archaic ideas new nianhua has proven to be a beloved art medium rich in educational value with the chinese lunar new year fast approaching the first since the founding of the prc local cultural and educational organizations should look upon the development and spreading of nianhua as one of their most essential tasks during this new years propaganda activities
4395355 the new prints should convey the following messages the grand victory of the chinese peoples war for liberation and the peoples great revolution the establishment of the peoples republic the common program and the recovery and progress of industrial and agricultural production to launch a widespread nianhua movement regional cultural and education agencies and art organizations should mobilize artists to produce new prints letting them known that this is an important artistic undertaking with wide impact we oppose those artists who tend to belittle the task of popularization moreover we should work with those who engage in the old nianhua trade and cooperate with folk artists providing them with new sketches reforming them and through them reaching a wide audience

4395358 in terms of how weve responded to this the president was informed immediately on friday when we received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers into georgian territory
4395359 the missile itself can be used for precise strikes on enemy targets with tactical importance such as control posts bridges and storage facilities it can be also very effective against troop concentrations and airfields weakening the enemy overall if needed the frag he warhead can be replaced with a nuclear biological or chemical warhead

4395409 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4395410 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4395411 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4395412 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4395413 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4395414 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4395415 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4395416 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4395417 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4395418 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4395419 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4395420 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4395421 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4395425 the only way they can detect this is if they grab take the underwear with their hands and go through it and feel it
4395426 mr schofield was innocent hes been through quite an ordeal
4395427 this conceded false explanation may go some distance in confirming figueroas involvement in the murder conspiracy

4395434 under no circumstances will any recruiter threaten coerce manipulate or intimidate future soldiers nor may they obstruct separation requests
4395435 at no time will any recruiter tell a delayed entry program member he or she must go in the army or he or she will go to jail
4395436 youre awol absent without leave you want to go to school you will not get no loans because all college loans are federal and government loans so youll be black barred from that as soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket theyre gonna see youre a deserter theyre going to apprehend you take you to jail
4395437 so guess what all that lovey dovey i wanna go to college and all that guess what you just threw it out the window because you just screwed your life
4395438 she tells me about the stories that happen in iraq some people kill themselves or get shot
4395439 by federal law you got an appointment with me at two this afternoon at greenspoint mall
4395440 ok you fail to appear and well have a warrant ok so give me a call back
4395441 i just want to know why youre telling young recruits theyll go to jail if they want out of the delayed entry program
4395442 wed just like to know why youre telling them that
4395443 im on vacation right now i really dont want to be bothered
4395444 we dont want the government military the army deceiving american citizens
4395445 this criterion may deter marine corps recruiters from committing recruiter violations
4395446 you get into basic training and you dont like it tell the chaplain you dont like it thats the right way to get out of the army then theyll process you out of the army and its nothing against your record
4395447 yeah and guess what if you do it that way maybe in the future you may say well darn im coming to join the army then guess what you can you can join the army cuz you got out of the army the right way you at least got to go to basic training and try it
4395448 i mean thats the only way i cant do it right here
4395449 once you report to basic training it is harder to get out of the army than if you ask for separation before enlisting
4395450 and we certainly dont want people to fake an injury or whatever in boot camp just because the recruiter suggested they do that to get out of the army permanently
4395451 army recruiters receive recruiter incentive points for those recruits that ship to basic training
4395452 this change was not like the marine corps system which took away all the recruiters credit if the recruit did not make it through basic training
4395453 lose points for those recruits that do not ship to basic training recruiting personnel are also penalized under the recruiter incentive pay recruiting personnel must not exceed the commands loss rate in order to maintain their monetary incentive
4395454 if we could make all the military branches not count a recruit as a recruit until they finish boot camp then youre not gonna have the problem
4395455 we have no plan to adopt the u s marine corps model
4395456 recruiters should not threaten applicants or future soldiers that violates our regulations
4395457 since the army hasnt taken the initiative now congress may have to get involved
4395458 the recruiter against whom the allegations were made has been taken off recruiting duty pending the outcome of the investigation
4395459 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4395460 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
4395461 the united states spent 45 years working very hard to avoid a military confrontation with russia
4395462 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
4395463 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
4395464 as it stands this proposal leaves the russians in total control
4395465 there is nothing in here about the inviolability of georgias frontiers
4395466 theyre not coming back because the people of basra will not have them back
4395467 the basrawis realized what a nightmare literally that was theyre not going to put themselves back through that period of violent extremism theyve got better things now to do with their lives and i do not see basra coming back under militia control those days are past
4395468 some will continue to try and attack us and the iraqi security forces because between us we have frustrated their designs
4395469 and there are violent extremists around who for whatever their perverted motives will try and slow down iraqs irreversible recovery but they wont succeed because with the iraqi security forces we are building a counterterrorist structure in basra that will be proof against them
4395470 as security improves as iraqi security force improve theres going to be scope obviously for the government to review those numbers
4395471 i think there will be a fundamental mission change and the troop numbers will be tailored to what that mission is
4395472 its not really helpful to speculate at the moment but as security improves and as the iraqi security forces improve their capabilities as they are doing daily then obviously there is scope for numbers to be reviewed
4395473 property prices have more than doubled since march one house is going for 90 000 pounds us 170 000 a threefold increase

4395477 what you want the people to think what we do in our home is supposed to stay right there what kind of picture are you trying to paint sure aint no mona lisa cause youre running out of paint theres two sides to every story you said your piece now the blame is on me how could you have the odessity to say these things that you say about me two sides to every story the blame is on you the blame is on me

4395481 ah jaysus no it couldnt have been sure you couldve bought the internet for that money in those days
4395482 its enormously gratifying to be able to play a role in providing this type of critical financing to low income households in jordan
4395483 chf is an organization that has been working hard to improve the lives of jordanians since 1997 when we began the microcredit program that ultimately developed into the middle east micro credit company memcc with our global experience in the field of credit we know what a fundamental difference access to credit makes in these peoples lives
4395484 we saw this car in may of 06 and all of us were just freaking out finally a car
4395485 zenn was the first neighborhood electric car that actually looked and felt and drove like a real car everything else before that was either a converted golf cart or a car that was built from the ground up
4395486 and if they do get into a collision the impact is much less severe
4395487 we would be able to sell as many of these cars as theyre selling hondas and toyotas
4395488 even if they made it a 30 000 car easily we could have toyota numbers theres enough people out there who are tired of paying high prices for gas who dont like buying and supporting foreign oil

4395493 what else would you expect from the party that promoted troy buswell to the leadership protected him despite his appalling behaviour and has now rewarded him with the key treasury portfolio
4395494 the liberal party is very much a boys club and colin barnett and troy buswell intend to keep it that way
4395495 youve got the biggest gender pay gap in western australia of any state and its getting worse and youve got less numbers of women in the senior executive service of the public sector

4395497 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf

4395499 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4395500 we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4395501 i am satisfied that the history given by jatinder to the ambulance officers and to doctors of the consumption of 16 panadol tablets was not true
4395502 i also accept expert evidence that the amount consumed must have been well in excess of that disclosed
4395503 my wife was very friendly a good lady i still miss her

4395523 throughout the year youll go through a series of test matches and identify the really big ones and this is right up there possibly the biggest so as a team we feel pressure to succeed
4395524 saturday will be the true test for us were up against the best lineout in the world
4395525 australia only had two lineout jumpers where the boks have a number of options so itll be a real test for us
4395526 theyre always good in the scrums and im impressed with the talent they have there
4395527 they were very good against argentina and i expect that to be a pretty even contest
4395528 george backs his lines and bides his time before he has a crack at the rucks and hes pretty effective then schalk definitely makes his presence felt in defence and at the breakdown hes everywhere and that battle is one im looking forward to

4395530 obama will work tirelessly to uphold this nations sacred trust with its veterans to ensure they are not forgotten after they return home and he will provide our troops with the leadership they deserve as well as the support they and their families need
4395531 john mccain has been endorsed by more retired admirals and generals than barack obama has military donors
4395532 we feel confident that many u s troops stationed overseas will support john mccain in the election this fall but we suspect most are too busy doing the important work of defending this country than to make political contributions

4395559 everybodys got something to hide except me and my monkey
4395560 fortunately no one was seriously injured by these violent acts
4395561 however i fear that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously hurt or even killed because of the research they perform or merely because they live in the same home as one of the targets
4395562 uc researchers and staff along with their spouses and children live in daily fear for their safety
4395563 the escalation of violence has grown at an alarming rate

4395566 it does concern me that not only in missouri but apparently other states this is the person they turn to
4395567 it does illustrate how difficult it is to find doctors willing to do this
4395568 i assure them ive taken care of everything so that nothing will go wrong i help them calmly go through the procedure
4395569 it will have the same effect the guy will die
4395570 we always get a tight match against ballymena and i expect this one to be the same
4395571 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4395572 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4395573 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4395574 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4395575 doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results

4395580 caffeine and taurine both of these individually point towards being beneficial but maybe theres something quirky about the effect of the combination of the two which is causing this reaction this is what we need to look at next
4395581 the study does not show effects which would go beyond that of drinking a cup of coffee therefore the reported results were to be expected and lie within the normal physiological range

4395584 tell me more joe when you are given conflicting direction from russ and corey how does that impact your driver crew
4395585 first of all i have a great crew dedicated and very serious when the going gets tough they know at the end of this project based on delays there is going to be hell to pay they know the excuses will fly and part of the blame will land on logistics
4395586 that during the project they have no control over priorities and sequence they make recommendations but they are not in a position to know the overall impact or changes in scope or changes in schedule they are only in a position to move our heavy equipment as instructed
4395587 i keep it pretty simple my only contract with them is that they do their best and if at the end of the day the goals arent met then the accountability for the shortfall must be with the leadership it is leadership that determines the schedule sets the pace allocates the resources and makes the decisions that determine the outcome
4395588 the united states is committed to securing a diplomatic resolution with iran on the nuclear issue
4395589 once that is resolved there will be enough opportunities with iran through the oic and others to work on other areas
4395590 we want iran to play a responsible role in the region and it is an important country
4395591 we are looking at only one objective and that is to ensure that there is peace and stability
4395592 everywhere america has engaged and has a presence those societies have opened and they have become more progressive and they are more moderate societies
4395593 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4395594 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4395595 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4395596 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4395597 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4395598 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4395599 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4395600 a modest tax increase on incomes above 300 000 a year thats the 2 3 of households making almost 6 000 a week would collect 6 7 billion a year in additional revenue and help to right the balance
4395601 the big tent mold with a mix of education establishment types lobbyists local officials tax critics school funding advocates and at least one wall streeter
4395602 i think it appropriate to emphasize the distinction between constitutionality and wise policy
4395603 the constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws
4395604 if i can take a nap even 15 or 20 minutes in the middle of the day it is really invigorating to me on the days when im a little short of sleep i try to work it out so that i can sneak off and just lie down for 15 minutes a half an hour and it really makes all the difference in the world

4395634 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4395635 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4395642 the impact that camcord piracy has on the movie industry and on the jobs the industry creates is enormous as copies of movies are often made available on the internet and duplicated onto pirated dvds within hours of movies opening in the cinemas
4395643 i dont see local films available on the net immediately after release

4395657 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4395715 and there are violent extremists around who for whatever their perverted motives will try and slow down iraqs irreversible recovery but they wont succeed because with the iraqi security forces we are building a counterterrorist structure in basra that will be proof against them
4395716 as security improves as iraqi security force improve theres going to be scope obviously for the government to review those numbers
4395717 i think there will be a fundamental mission change and the troop numbers will be tailored to what that mission is

4395728 de fastholder forventningerne som man havde regnet med men kvartalets andel af rets oms tninger er noget lavere end i 2007 hvilket betyder at der kommet et endnu tungere pres p andet halv r og det er et usikkerhedsmoment

4395795 no i dont think so im committed to beginning a withdrawal within 60 days
4395796 not among those who have argued for the early withdrawal of u s troops from iraq i believe president bush was right to claim that a precipitous pullback could lead to catastrophe but wrong to assume that the presence of our troops would somehow prevent catastrophe

4395877 es temerosa la sombra oscura que se viene levantando con figura de pobreza extrema y hambre originada en parte por el alza mundial del precio del petr leo el deslizamiento de la moneda el crecimiento desmedido del precio de la canasta b sica las cat strofes como el incendio que destruy el mercado oriental y el insuficiente salario m nimo
4395878 la tensi n que esto implica genera adem s otro tipo de problemas como la violencia intrafamiliar abandono de los estudios estancamiento cultural toma de tierras delincuencia creciente migraci n forzada inseguridad ciudadana narcotr fico y hasta conflictos armados
4395879 la falta de transparencia en el manejo y distribuci n de algunas ayudas venidas de otros pa ses ha despertado la preocupaci n de la sociedad nicarag ense y de la comunidad donante internacional apareciendo una vez m s la sombra de la corrupci n que deteriora la econom a nacional
4395880 hay una indiferencia c vica ciudadana que se manifiesta en una falta de inter s por las elecciones y por la participaci n en otras actividades de la vida p blica debido a que ha bajado notablemente el nivel tico del discurso pol tico convertido en discurso enga oso cargado de insultos descalificaci n del adversario y hasta calumnioso
4395881 desalienta la ausencia de un liderazgo de calidad y comprometido que norme la acci n pol tica en la que todo parece estar al servicio de personas grupos de poder y de partido en detrimento del bien com n
4395882 la regresi n de formas superadas de autoritarismo no se pueden ver como acciones desestabilizadoras todas las opiniones de desacuerdo que brotan en los diversos sectores ni se puede estar insultando y recriminando constantemente a quien no est alineado al pensamiento del grupo gobernante
4395883 frustraci n pol tica en la ciudadan a debido a determinaciones institucionales que reducen los espacios de participaci n deteriorando el pluralismo pol tico se percibe un malestar creciente por el rumor popular de una posible distribuci n de cuotas de poder en los poderes legislativo electoral y judicial que condicionan las determinaciones
4395884 consideramos que est deteriorando la estabilidad social y econ mica del pa s el hecho de que algunos de los que participan en la vida p blica frecuentemente est n utilizando un lenguaje descalificador violento y confrontativo
4395885 se faltar a a la responsabilidad social al crecimiento econ mico a la reconciliaci n y a la paz si se promueve la polarizaci n de la sociedad la desconfianza en la inversi n extranjera el avivamiento del odio de clases la descalificaci n el exclusivismo y la represi n
4395886 partimos del hecho que todo ciudadano tiene derecho a elegir y ser elegido faltar amos a nuestra responsabilidad ciudadana si nos mantenemos al margen en el ejercicio de este derecho dejando en manos de un solo sector el decidir sobre el rumbo de nuestros gobiernos municipales
4395887 la participaci n m s amplia en los asuntos pol ticos del pa s se dar a a trav s de elecciones democr ticas desarrolladas en condiciones favorables sin inclinaciones injustas que vayan a favorecer o privilegiar cualquier ideolog a que se proclamara ser la nica int rprete de las aspiraciones del pueblo
4395888 aunque ocasionalmente en el ambiente social se perciben dudas sobre la transparencia en el proceso electoral el ciudadano deber a persistir en su voto queremos hacer un llamado al sentido de responsabilidad de los laicos para que est n presentes en la vida p blica y m s concreto en la formaci n de los consensos necesarios y en la oposici n contra las injusticias
4395889 la ley electoral deber a garantizar el buen desarrollo de las elecciones lamentablemente ha surgido un clima de desconfianza e incredulidad frente a la instituci n llamada a ejecutar esta ley el consejo supremo electoral lo que suscita sospecha en un sector de los participantes y sociedad en general
4395890 exhortamos al fiel cumplimiento de las normas que garanticen un juego limpio y transparente basado en la verdad consideramos que es un grave reto moral de los miembros del consejo electoral recuperar la credibilidad y devolver la confianza a los ciudadanos
4395891 fortalecimiento de la confianza en el proceso la necesidad de
4395892 es claro que las instituciones que presiden nuestra naci n como la corte suprema de justicia y la asamblea nacional no est n al margen de toda esta realidad y hasta pueden ser utilizadas para maniobrar el proceso electoral desde decisiones oscuras por eso es nuestro deber hacerles un respetuoso llamado a todos los insignes miembros de tan honorables instituciones
4395893 a mantener la objetividad el profesionalismo y la fidelidad constitucional sobre todo en momento de elecciones es sabido que la log stica militar y policial ha ayudado al sano desenvolvimiento del clima electoral por ello exhortamos a que en este momento contin en siendo fieles a la ley y a los m s nobles ideales de su instituci n
4395894 los exhortamos a ser fieles a la verdad objetividad y al profesionalismo para no promover el error en el voto del pueblo y la frustraci n cuando ya no se pueda corregir la decisi n si la informaci n conceptual que se emite no corresponde a la verdad o se manipula se es c mplice de una decisi n desacertada

4395952 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4395953 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4395954 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4395955 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4395956 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4395957 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4395958 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4395959 double salaries for our fighters in iraq one year of service to count as three
4395960 the eu will never repay the money spent on projects
4395961 va a cambiar la cara de los juegos electr nicos haciendo posible que los juegos sean controlados e influenciados por la mente del jugador
4395962 cuando las neuronas interact an se emite un impulso el ctrico que puede ser observado usando electroencefalograf a no intrusiva
4395963 epoc a adi usa esta tecnolog a para medir las se ales
4395964 ha sido probado con cientos de personas y siempre ha funcionado
4395965 no creo que est preparado para ser tan preciso como ser a necesario para funcionar como un sustituto de la consola en la mayor a de los juegos
4395966 lo que m s me interes fue el concepto de que este aparato puede captar tus emociones
4395967 imagina por ejemplo un silent hill una popular saga de videojuegos de terror que sabe lo que m s te asusta y lo aterrado que est s en cada momento del juego las implicaciones dan miedo
4395968 i struggle to find evidence of beauty in contemporary art if i go to an exhibition i pretend to understand like many others but honestly i dont understand
4395969 the comments follow a number of attacks on modern architecture by ministers including bondi and the prime minister silvio berlusconi that has left the arts world aghast
4395970 the closure of the purse seine fishery is necessary to protect this fragile resource and ensure the recovery of the stock
4395971 i dont agree with this decision because it is unjustified and because it fails to take full account of the economic and social impact it will have on a sector that is already in crisis
4395972 i deplore this decision made without having taken account of technical factors and catch figures
4395973 the urgent organisation of a meeting of experts from the eu executive commission to provide useful data on bluefin tuna catches by purse seiners in the countries concerned
4395974 my best going into tokyo at the time was way off the favourites
4395975 my aim was to try and make the bronze i had to be realistic
4395976 the same can be said for chris this week looking at the rankings he has to be realistic but also optimistic
4395977 take irving saladino he can jump 8 70 metres and i personally think it will be won with 8 50m to 8 60m but you never know what can happen on the day itself
4395978 when i went to those games there were two guys who were certainties for gold and silver ralph boston was the clear favourite then there was the russian igor ter ovanesyan
4395979 i was well down the order of rankings but on the day there was all sorts of weather there was wind and rain the worst possible conditions but it was a great leveller and i managed to beat them both
4395980 what will make a big difference is if they can emulate mary rand who won long jump gold on the first day in tokyo as it lifted the whole team
4395981 if kelly sotherton wins gold on saturday it will have the same effect and then who knows how many medals they will be showing off after the games
4395982 this year for me its chelsea i always felt that united would do it last year but i fancy chelsea this time
4395983 theres no african nations theyve got a new manager theyve bought one or two new players and for all the ups and downs last year at chelsea they still nearly nicked it if united get a top top striker then theyve got a chance but my gut feeling this year would be chelsea
4395984 the lads coming in have added real quality so its up to the others to come with us that would include deano dean whitehead grant leadbitter yorkie dwight yorke our defenders stokesy anthony stokes murph darryl murphy its competition for places and its priceless im telling you
4395985 its priceless because the good players the better players will just push each other on said keane who confirmed he expects diouf pascal chimbonda malbranque and teemu tianio to start against liverpool tomorrow
4395986 it doesnt matter what the manager or coaching staff do its about the players and on any sort of bad day at the training ground youre left well behind and there are signs already that one or two of our players are being left behind
4395987 i think liverpool will go close and im sure theyd like to think theyd go closer than the last few years because they seem to be chipping away every season he said
4395988 i cant speak highly enough of liverpool a great club with a great manager and a great history
4395989 with the quality weve got now particularly going forward we hope we can cause them a few problems
4395990 theyll have a few players making their debuts too so it might be a good time to catch them
4395991 its been knee hamstring thigh and now achilles so it is a worry and its been going on for too long for our liking
4395992 hes not been fit long enough hes only played 14 or 15 games and his goals per game ratio is excellent
4395993 previous to the last couple of years hes not been injuryplagued he had a couple of hernias at huddersfield im not sure if he got injured or not at swansea but hes certainly had enough injuries since he came here
4395994 i would have liked pawel to be ready and available by now but he isnt so ive got to deal with it and it gives other people a chance people like curtis
4395995 he got a little taste of it at the end of last season and craig liddle head of youth is going to be disappointed when curtis is spending more time with us
4395996 but hes a strong lad and thats what he might need being with the first team theres no point holding him back if hes ready to play with us
4395997 agreement would allow a further warming in ties between tripoli and washington
4395998 this international agreement between the two sides ends any pending issue between tripoli and washington it clears the way for normal and complete relations between libya and the usa
4395999 im optimistic that this agreement will be implemented soon this agreement will settle the last major issue which is compensation
4396000 the uae regards these unlawful acts as a flagrant violation
4396001 such violations do not help promote bilateral relations between the united arab emirates and the islamic republic
4396002 i think the whole thing is more of symbolic importance
4396003 its establishing a presence showing the flag and challenging the expansion of russian power in that country
4396004 the economic reconstruction and also what to do to help the georgian security forces looking to the longer term future
4396005 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4396006 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4396007 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4396008 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of
4396009 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4396010 no one could believe peaches had invited faris round as soon as she got back never mind let him stay the night
4396011 they were a couple before she went to las vegas then she decides to get married on a whim comes back and rings up faris as if what she has done is the most normal thing in the world
4396012 she lives in a bubble and is loving all the attention but shes a married woman now and needs to grow up
4396013 catherine was heartbroken when the family called her to say her gran had gone
4396014 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4396015 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4396016 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4396017 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4396018 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4396019 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4396020 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4396021 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4396022 willie was rested with all respect we want him fit for league games and it was a time for alan power to get a chance said wilson
4396023 alan will get used to league football and its very quick and hot in there the opposition were tough and experienced and he was up against a tough task
4396024 alan is a bit like a few of the younger boys in that he is getting used to this standard of football you have to anticipate and get a foot in get used to it you have time in the reserves to look around and spray balls around and think about it more often than not you dont in league football
4396025 its quicker and harder but he will get used to it the more games he plays when you get kicked on the backside you react and learn from it
4396026 hes got a lot in his locker he can tackle pass and get it around a bit
4396027 weve put three lads in the other night who did really well but the squad isnt the biggest we had a couple of 17 year olds on the bench
4396028 kini plester kinesio ini benar benar membantuku dan aku siap memberikan yang terbaik untuk negaraku
4396029 aku merasa sehat setiap hari dan ini membantuku untuk maksimal di lapangan terima kasih tentunya untuk charpantidis yang tak bosan menemaniku meski terkadang aku harus meringis dan menangis
4396030 jangan suruh aku untuk mengeja namanya yang sulit di lidahku tapi dia telah membuat keajaiban untukku
4396031 dua bulan lalu kami tidak yakin kalau kerri bakal ikut di olimpiade tapi hari ini walsd benar benar menunjukkan kapasitas juaranya dan bakal memaksa setiap lawannya untuk bertekuk lutut
4396032 memang sangat berat di awal tahun jika anda mengetahui mendapat cedera di tempat yang sangat penting bagi karir anda namun jika bersemangat itu tak akan terasa dan semuanya bakal berjalan sesuai dengan keinginan
4396033 sangat berat di awal tahun bagi kami dia nyaris putus asa
4396034 dia harus tetap berada di pasir pantai bukan untuk dia bukan untukku tapi selama masih untuk as dia harus berjuang keras
4396035 aku senang dengan julukan itu karena memang aku merasa betisku menjadi satu bagian yang terindah dari tubuhku dan aku menikmati semua itu
4396036 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
4396037 were concerned about reports that russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti that russian armored vehicles are blocking access to that port and that russia is blowing up georgian vessels
4396038 we have found that a lot of the initial reports that we have received on things going on in georgia have not been accurate
4396039 our latest information for example is that the commercial port at poti is intact and usable and we think that the russians never actually imposed a blockade
4396040 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict
4396041 people here just feel helpless they dont believe they can make a difference
4396042 you should care about the welfare of all its people not just the dominant group
4396043 hong kongers are caught in the fervor of the olympics
4396044 even if theyre not nationalist they wont be inclined to be sympathetic toward tibetans
4396045 daripada pusing terus mengawasinya lebih baik untuk sementara kami berpisah
4396046 wer sich als betreiber einer website selbst an nutzerdiskussionen beteiligt und deshalb kenntnis davon hat dass dort etwa k belweise schmutz ber eine namentlich benannte person ausgekippt wird muss handeln das hei t er muss diese rechtsverletzungen beseitigen wenn er nicht selbst in die haftung genommen werden will
4396047 the government caved in to settlers who threatened to use violence if they are evacuated while they illegally occupy private palestinian land
4396048 the thought of evacuating migron is against the torah and basic human morals
4396049 enable me to make a sounder decision about the facts of the case
4396050 never intended to release important information that would allow or teach a bad guy
4396051 we simply want them to provide the information thats been requested by the court or the mbta
4396052 preventing them from talking about what they found even though theres a public debate if these students figured it out other people could figure it out too
4396053 we have to get our regular season legs under us pretty quickly and become a better tackling team
4396054 nothing is broken schematically guys are where they are supposed to be we dont have enough guys making sure tackles
4396055 i thought we moved the football we stalled ourselves in drives you get penalties on third down and one its not going to help you
4396056 its critical to be involved in your community and we want to set a good example for our children
4396057 like so many heart disease has touched my family and regardless of who you are were all at risk that is why its so important for us to participate in the heart walk and do our part to help save lives
4396058 start not only promotes the importance of physical activity it also supports healthy living as a way of life and that is something yonka and i truly want our family and our community to embrace
4396059 its sweet being out here and seeing what the players do and having fun
4396060 i love football its a good opportunity to come out and see the beginning of the season its nice to get out its a beautiful day out here i love sports its good to get out here
4396061 we are going to play in the rain from time to time
4396062 we cant let rain stop us from what we need to do we will play in all sorts of circumstances hot cold wet dry as long as it is not lightning we need to get our work done
4396063 i got the call at seven last night in phoenix on a plane at 11 flew into atlanta and connected and got here and got settled and came to practice
4396064 i am just working on my kicking and timing and try to kick the ball the best i can
4396065 you saw what happened you guys saw it theres really nothing for me to say
4396066 this morning i thought as a football team we were in survival mode hopefully there was a feeling that we may have crossed a threshold this afternoon where they were enjoying it and not enduring it we are thriving only time will tell and we will see what its like tomorrow when we come out here and get us a couple in there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm in the afternoon the guys came and competed thats what training camp is about you go through a process you know you break the group down you break the bodies down if you will and you build them back up and get ready for action maybe it was a significant afternoon well see
4396067 what made me mad is i dont like missing anything i know these guys are tired because i am
4396068 its a great honor to be here with ben and also the rooney family
4396069 i have known them a long time and they have been great friends
4396070 i am just glad hines ward didnt show because i am not sure i could reach him
4396071 i only caught one i figured i would quit while i was ahead
4396072 you know i figured that if you put the chaplain on the line you get less beefs and complaints
4396073 i think it worked out for us im not going to second guess the chaplain he said he scored so he scored
4396074 im working with keith butler and some of the younger guys to show them some small things to help them make the team and make them better players
4396075 i have been away from the game for awhile but it does make you miss it
4396076 my wife warned me about coming home with those feelings i have to leave them up here
4396077 even when i was in detroit they were in the super bowl i was at the game going crazy like a no 1 steelers fan hopefully i can end my career here
4396078 it might be the only time the fans get the chance to get this close and try to get an autograph
4396079 it takes some time but i try to do it for them because i think they like it and enjoy it
4396080 its the opening day of camp and the anticipation of football season
4396081 a lot of us like to stay out a little later today even though its a long day they just want to get their favorite players autograph we might not be out there like that every day because some days you are exhausted but opening day you have to give a little extra
4396082 i wish i could be back out on the field
4396083 i am trying to change things up its a different look somebody suggested it to me and i took them up on it i have had it for about a month now
4396084 i just brought my tv so i can watch nfl network and law and order
4396085 i figured it would be something funny to do for camp
4396086 thats the kind of guy i am do something stupid you wouldnt expect a kicker to drive something like that
4396087 i had a hard time going through monroeville i never drove anything that big its supposed to pull a horse but today it just pulled me
4396088 i am behind the scenes in training camp they are doing 32 teams in 32 days so this is the steelers cam
4396089 despite clear inflation in some food products we have worked hard to cut our prices week after week and negotiated some fantastic deals with our suppliers to bring shopping bills down
4396090 mike and chris pioneered the genre more than 18 years ago and have shaped the sports talk format into what it is today
4396091 we wish chris nothing but the best and look forward to all that mike will do in a role in which he has excelled at for years
4396092 he gave us a card that said thinking of you
4396093 i was thinking that they might have the wrong guy
4396094 he would talk to me a lot hes very friendly so i couldnt imagine something like this happening
4396095 one time he gave my son a ride because they were on the same route going to d c
4396096 nicht in erster linie um musik sondern um unser gebet
4396097 das ist eine ganz besondere veranstaltung f rs uns eigentlich hatten wir zu beginn gar keine besonderen erwartungen
4396098 werden wir nummer eins werde ich einen zusatz rosenkranz beten
4396099 die lieder sind ein anti aggresivum und ein anti depressivum zugleich
4396100 it case was bound over to the grand jury by him waiving today
4396101 we are still hearing concerns especially regarding the heating oil
4396102 they the citizens of mcdowell county are very concerned about what they are going to do we are also getting a lot of responses from the community in wanting to help people realize theses high costs are going to impact people of low and middle income we have one of the highest populations of senior citizens in the state that group just needs a tremendous amount of help because of the high percentage of elderly and people with disabilities in the county we are in a little bit of a unique situation
4396103 the council as advocates for the low income families in our area realizes that action must be taken now to help offset the probable hardships facing people this coming winter
4396104 based on the dramatic price increases and our experience with high demand for assistance with home heating last winter intervention strategies must be developed
4396105 while carefully studying this proposal i learned that the transportation time information we provided in our original request to the school building authority was incorrect
4396106 i believe that if the sba had been provided with the transportation data we now have they would have been unlikely to approve the grant
4396107 furthermore this incorrect information remains in the consolidation document you are considering today additionally there are other factual errors in the consolidation document regarding curriculum and costs
4396108 ponemos mucho nfasis en la rapidez del servicio en la iluminaci n en los olores en la m sica contratamos incluso a personas que nunca han trabajado en hoteles porque nos gusta su car cter y queremos potenciarlo y no ocultarlo bajo un uniforme
4396109 vor allem in den usa gibt es derzeit eine sehr starke konzentration auf diesem markt
4396110 das beunruhigt viele leute wollen wir wirklich dass unser ganzer traffic ber ein zwei drei firmen l uft
4396111 i want to teach so many people in the world to speak chinese
4396112 when i heard they were offering a chinese class i signed up for it
4396113 its different than any other language offered at our school
4396114 it was a big surprise maybe a little culture shock
4396115 and that we think is just of incredible value in terms of securing the footprint for academic development long term to enable us to have the space for the new school of dentistry the school of medicine and our next research building
4396116 mcg will not spend any money on this land or this facility
4396117 hopes that well have people living there in august of 2010
4396118 we still have not regained distribution at our largest customer which is wal mart
4396119 we plan to give guidance to our board sometime during the third quarter
4396120 it starts pollinating usually about aug 15 give or take about 24 hours
4396121 both individuals with allergy and asthma are at risk of worsening disease more symptomatic days and reduced quality of life as a result of these environmental changes
4396122 what worries me even more is the effects of air pollution are quite clear and the combination of high air pollution and pollen is really bad for our allergy sufferers
4396123 thats only happened four times in the last 40 years
4396124 in that area there are thousands of black swamp snakes a rare little snake whose most abundant habitat happens to be ellenton bay they will estivate until it gets wet again a lot of animals do that they get through a drought by burrowing down and just sitting there
4396125 the nature of wetlands is that they dont always have to be wet
4396126 they just have to be wet long enough for wetland soils to develop and plants to grow there some wetlands will dry up tremendously before rains come back
4396127 seasonal wetlands can be dry more than half the time and yet be very productive
4396128 the most important thing is that they are capable of holding water at the most critical times salamanders and frogs for example breed in the winter thats when it has to have water
4396129 i guarantee you when the big rains come the native animals and plants will be back our perception is often how does drought affect people and domestic animals thats very different from the native animals and plants that have lived here for thousands of years
4396130 it could mean a totally new slicing of the pie
4396131 claude is the first person i needed to get on my staff
4396132 i actually recruited him harder than i had recruited herschel walker
4396133 the schedule is just going to be so tough playing lsu and florida back to back is a tremendous challenge
4396134 it will harm the school in the long run because i think it is a duplication of efforts
4396135 no s si esto es otra era pero est clara la insistencia del entrenador en cambiar unas cuantas cosas
4396136 si tenemos la pelota m s apunt el meta sufriremos menos y la mejor manera de defender es atacar todo el tiempo y con un ritmo alto
4396137 no s insisti xavi si empezamos de cero pero s que las sensaciones son muy buenas estamos en la l nea en el camino
4396138 con m s verticalidad y m s ritmo hay que ser m s directos
4396139 el equipo ha dado un paso adelante con este tipo de juego
4396140 me alegro mucho de que se haya quedado con nosotros es una maravilla como compa ero
4396141 etoo es un regalo para nosotros y para el club es un gran delantero un gran goleador
4396142 ya s que aqu s lo vale ganar ganar y ganar
4396143 our park plays completely different than theirs and it took us too long to figure that out
4396144 the pitching was there we threw well enough to have a chance and i was a little disappointed that we didnt compete better than we did
4396145 we will be looking at a mechanism to verify hotel stays that is not overly burdensome for the visitor but would help eliminate potential fraud
4396146 all this has been going on and they havent told us a thing about it
4396147 weve got to put a stop to it reprogram it expeditiously we cant have folks riding free
4396148 its still long if i come back next year it will be shorter
4396149 right up to the olympic trials i was busy all the time
4396150 it was crazy its definitely slowed down a little more since
4396151 i tried very hard to make sure everything went to form
4396152 what sets him apart from other throwers is his attention to details
4396153 when he sets his goals he doesnt set it over and beyond
4396154 he sets it a few inches at a time that makes it more gettable even in school with his grades he never tried for the a plus he tried for the best grades he could get and he did it that way he never felt like he was let down he had great dreams but he was so realistic with them
4396155 im a media darling in some ways and that takes some getting used to having the attention on me in a way makes me a little uncomfortable but i just kind of worked my way into that role ive embraced the role and im having so much fun
4396156 theyre at their peak and the main competition has probably seen their better days or hasnt gotten there yet
4396157 some are trying to equate me with bruce jenner and al oerter and all these icons of u s track and field
4396158 im thinking ive got to do more than just be a world champion if youre going to equate me to olympic champions if i pull off winning the olympic gold you can put me in there but i still feel like ive got to do a little more they figured out a way to transcend just track and field and parlayed their experiences into something that not only the normal person but the business world could get into say their names and people automatically know who they are
4396159 when he wins something stand back out of the way
4396160 it was a very hard decision for us to make
4396161 he was a lot better at the end of practice
4396162 i think it should be successful i did everything he asked me to do
4396163 right now as far as funding were a little over 2 million for the fiscal year that ends this october
4396164 all the different divisions of doe and wsrc westinghouse savannah river company have been very supportive in trying to help us obtain funding wherever appropriate
4396165 when i started this job i was hoping to apply for one external grant a month and its closer to two right now at this point its looking good for next year
4396166 it was fantastic to have all these people here at one time
4396167 some of them had worked on the same projects but in different decades
4396168 but im up to my neck in work today i dont have time to chat
4396169 but ive got some good news and some bad news for you dear
4396170 but as ive got no time right now just give me the good news
4396171 the yaraan sim was created with youth in mind in afghanistan youth under 20 make up more than 55 of the population with yaraan this afghan demographic now has a competitive affordable and attractive tariff on the roshan network the new product is another example of how roshan continues to be the innovative telecommunications market leader in afghanistan
4396172 i keep thinking were going to get that phone call
4396173 i hope every day for that it hasnt come yet but i know it will
4396174 he used to tell robbie stay strong because youre a moore
4396175 i got to believe that because hes beat the statistics twice gods got something planned for this boy hes definitely putting up a fight
4396176 we would not have known if he didnt have the breathing problems
4396177 his heart is three times the size of a normal heart and it only does half the work
4396178 its relatively rare for a baby to go into cardiac arrest
4396179 at best one out of two kids survive it when it does happen
4396180 there were times when we didnt even see each other because we had to have opposite schedules at work
4396181 we were under so much stress but we knew we had to do what we had to we loved each other and we had two families that loved each other so much
4396182 we have always taught her that you never know what bumps and curves will be in the road
4396183 it was always comforting to watch nick because he always jumped in there to love robbie and nicholas as well as really take care of them
4396184 i just remember when they showed him to me it looked like nothing happened to him
4396185 i just wanted to kick him and tell him to wake up
4396186 i was still digesting my husbands death then i couldnt help but be happy when i heard that but to realize it was a false alarm was hard im still on an emotional roller coaster
4396187 when i go up to charleston every week i see my son in robbie
4396188 he lights up and kicks his legs and that makes me feel better
4396189 we want the heart yesterday but she knows you have to have a lot of patience and a lot of faith
4396190 people tell us sometimes they feel so bad for us but i tell them not to we have hope
4396191 you know i have a long history with the roxy so i only thought it appropriate that i come here to share my album with you and dance
4396192 it all started here with 12 inches some girls have all the luck
4396193 hiv aids was really starting to spread and be addressed and at the time there was such a dark cloud over the gay community
4396194 i think gay people needed an escape from all the death and darkness and to still feel that it was ok to be sexual madonna was so outwardly sexual and her songs were fun and upbeat and it didnt matter who you were you were invited along
4396195 in her early years she had swarms of gay dancers smers and all purpose freaks around her in every photograph and on every stage
4396196 everyone could plainly see that she was not only very sexually open minded herself but thought the rest of the world would follow suit
4396197 guys feelings towards gays has nothing to do with madonna and has nothing to do with the amazing body of work shes put out over the past 26 years
4396198 if you look at michael jackson and prince and even janet jackson they are all putting out music and have huge fan bases
4396199 i think as any artist ages the key is staying relevant in their genre of music
4396200 democrats will fight to end discrimination based on race sex ethnicity national origin language religion sexual orientation gender identity age and disability in every corner of our country because thats the america we believe in
4396201 we support the full inclusion of all families including same sex couples in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
4396202 we will pass the local law enforcement hate crimes prevention act because hate crimes desecrate sacred spaces and belittle all good people
4396203 the 2008 democratic national platform is by far the most pro equality platform in democratic history
4396204 we support full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life our nation and seek equal responsibilities benefits and protections for these families
4396205 we support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections
4396206 if the story is about four words being missing it would not be reporting that millions of our lives are included in this document
4396207 you dont want to take anyone for granted you want to let everyone know that their vote counts that you care about their issues and that youre listening
4396208 when we did it in 92 it was through the national human rights campaign we tried to start working out of the democratic national committees headquarters on spring street and i dont think they even gave us any space
4396209 we came up with a list of 40 to 50 things people can do aside from donating money
4396210 in georgia as far as mccain goes people are making up their own mind about it
4396211 i get a lot of phone calls and emails from our members asking if we have made an endorsement and we havent were waiting for the national lcr to make an endorsement and then well follow them
4396212 i think obamas taken a very strong positions on behalf of the glbt community
4396213 from the start he was one of the candidates to support a complete repeal of the defense of marriage act not just the definition of marriage but the part that keeps states from recognizing marriages from other states
4396214 this is probably one of the first political campaigns ive ever gotten involved in
4396215 i didnt get politically involved or understand why i should get politically involved until i saw barack at georgia tech last fall
4396216 at first i think it was because he was just so charismatic and you can sit and listen to him for hours then as i followed the campaign i saw the consistency of his character
4396217 the idea of completely changing the way that america looks at leadership maybe getting away from the idea that only white men can be president maybe america is getting closer to the idea of equality
4396218 most of the time i dont watch anything to do with politics barack impressed me when he told an african american church that they need to support their gay brothers
4396219 i feel he doesnt mind pushing the limit to get his point out there
4396220 i think there are two or three things that would have to happen in order for obama to win this state
4396221 there would have to be large black turnout but i dont think you can boost black turnout enough to win just by that that so the other thing obama has to do is attract a much larger percentage of the white vote than even georgians like mark taylor have gotten
4396222 obama needs to get a share of the white vote
4396223 the rule of thumb used to be in georgia that you needed 90 percent among from black voters and 40 percent among of the white vote to win as a democrat
4396224 you have to figure that most of bob barrs votes are going to come from whites
4396225 so if bob barr runs well and takes a good percentage of votes it will primarily be white votes then thats the perfect storm for obama
4396226 if its close enough than it can make a difference
4396227 an energized gay community could help obama gain support in the white community and going back as far as 2002 democrats have not done well there
4396228 if 100 percent of the gay people in georgia turn out to vote obama will win
4396229 i think it might be a little tighter race than say for bush in 04 but one thing it has done for us is it has made our people realize they have to work harder
4396230 i dont intend to be the first woman elected chairman of georgia and not to deliver georgia and its 13 electoral votes to a republican

4396243 kami mulai membicarakan hal ini dan aku rasa 30 atau 60 hari lagi kami sudah bisa membicarakan semuanya tentang hal itu
4396244 once in a while it sounds like a raccoon dying
4396245 it was kind of like a big happy family thing we were just trying to express our freedoms and have fun
4396246 kami sungguh bangga dan terharu atas antusiasme yang ditunjukkan masyarakat dari seluruh daerah di indonesia lagu lagu muslim memang memiliki keindahan tersendiri selain liriknya yang dapat mengingatkan diri kita terhadap kebesaran dan keagungan allah swt

4396251 in my mind it will stop the shredding of the fabric of our community we must put opportunities in front of our children so that they can go to work and earn a living
4396252 to object to what you call government welfare is your privilege but its not something i can agree with
4396253 i hope you recognize that all the people who have spoken are giving a consistent message we are united together
4396254 we followed up as many leads as we had we always considered moore a person of interest but back in 2003 we didnt have enough to make the case
4396255 the article came out in the paper and based on that we started getting new leads
4396256 this year youll see an even bigger difference because of the economy
4396257 this year the sales tax holiday is sure to be much needed and much appreciated by families shopping for school clothes and fall wardrobes
4396258 the main benefit is the tax savings on top of the fact that retailers have aggressive promotions
4396259 the holiday is always a good incentive to bring shoppers back downtown and take advantage of great offers that a lot of the stores have
4396260 downtown has everything from national retailers like bass shoes factory outlet chicos izod van heusen and a number of independents like douglas mens store footsies ha bas cruz cortez intima boutique nefertiti and many more
4396261 were expecting big crowds for the holiday weekend especially with gas prices right now
4396262 we would expect that a lot of people in the houston metro area who might have traveled further will take advantage of having great beaches and shopping on galveston island
4396263 we felt there was sufficient evidence to back it up
4396264 freely sharing with him confidential proprietary and trade secret information
4396265 a jury made a decision and now we have to deal with that
4396266 we are traveling to south africa with president robert mugabe today as the negotiations continue
4396267 the talks never collapsed and all parties are committed to the dialogue i would also want to confirm commitment to see the talks end successfully sooner rather than later

4396281 we have two realistic chances of winning trophies this year and that is the setanta cup and the fai cup
4396282 i think the fai cup is more important as it guarantees a uefa cup spot and that is something that drogheda needs we are full time and are looking at going into a new stadium so we need to have european football
4396283 when i signed for drogheda i left longford at a time when they were going into europe and it was a big decision drogheda didnt have that but the bigger picture was to guarantee that every year
4396284 with the way that i play it will be sensational to play with lampard
4396285 i have always been confident he would stick around and i for one am pleased because i want to be in the same team as him
4396286 scolari is prepared for this challenge i have seen him show a lot of spirit and hunger to succeed
4396287 i have no doubt he will be a success in the premier league he only needs a little time to adapt to what is going on scolaris position at chelsea was crucial to my decision to join this club
4396288 now we are in negotiations with tottenham and some clarity is likely to come on friday evening
4396289 zenit have decided to reduce the asking price for andrei but exactly how much i cannot say because the negotiations were led by zenit president alexander dyukov

4396324 ich bedauere es sehr dass sich jedes mal ein bundesweit bekanntes nachrichtenmagazin vor den karren dieser denunzianten hat spannen lassen

4396376 personally i want to keep improving be successful and win more things
4396377 hopefully that will drive us on to more success this season it is harder in the sense that all the other teams have improved and are getting better
4396378 weve been champions two years on the spin and are even more of a scalp so teams are really up for it we managed to overcome that challenge last season and that success drives you on
4396379 i think we will improve this season as well as other teams and its who can do it over the course of a season
4396380 weve managed to do it the past couple of years and its the test to do it again
4396381 the big clubs are always going to be in there towards the end of the season and it is really tough
4396382 those type of things are won and lost on really small things as we saw in the final last year so you need that bit of luck
4396383 weve shown we can do it once so we will try to do it again if we were to do it again this season two years in a row it would be absolutely incredible but weve got to perform and see how far it takes us

4396453 the time has come to look beyond the issue of re skinning and plan for the future reuse of the hangar
4396454 we have been told repeatedly by our representatives in washington that its hard to find money to preserve the hangar if there is no reuse plan

4396503 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements

4396520 we need to analyse them now and its a matter of getting the teaching staff to look at areas that need to be improved its quite complicated as most subjects do six units and we have to look for patterns and it takes two to three years to see if there is a trend there
4396521 overall our results are very tentative as we are waiting for a number of grades that will make a substantial difference to our pass percentages students coming in are very pleased with their results and getting into their chosen universities and thatthe most important thing

4396524 we advise students not to cash their results in automatically at this stage but to consider if there are any units they wish to improve upon in year 13
4396525 we are pleased with the results as the students undertake these courses in addition to their main vocational qualification
4396526 months of political deadlock have finally come to an end
4396527 the alliance has made it certain prachanda will become prime minister as theyll easily get the votes needed for a simple majority
4396528 he is packing his bags and will leave friday afternoon
4396529 theres no question of joining a maoist led government if our candidate is defeated
4396530 talks are underway and many people are interested that the issue is settled amicably without going into the impeachment of president pervez musharraf
4396531 my belief is that the president does not intend to leave the country there is no question of him leaving pakistan
4396532 it becomes very unimportant for me to comment on these reports i have been hearing all this for the past many months
4396533 musharraf will neither face impeachment nor be prosecuted we expect a major development in the next 48 hours
4396534 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4396535 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it
4396536 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4396537 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
4396538 we do take very seriously the concerns of our ally
4396539 we would start with a battery under us command but made available to the polish army then there would be a second phase involving equipping the polish army with missiles
4396540 in five seven or 10 years we want to be sufficiently well equipped and well trained to be ready both with our allies but by ourselves to defend ourselves at a critical moment
4396541 committed to close cooperation with poland in the event of a danger from a third party
4396542 a new element to take our security agreement to a new level
4396543 i have no indication that russias invasion of georgia at all influenced the negotiations but who knows you can draw your own conclusions
4396544 however the european missile defense is not aimed at countering russias missile arsenal but rather at emerging threats such as iran
4396545 were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4396546 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4396547 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4396548 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4396549 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4396550 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4396551 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4396552 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4396553 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4396554 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4396555 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4396556 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4396557 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4396558 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4396559 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4396560 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4396561 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4396562 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4396563 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4396564 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4396565 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4396566 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4396567 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4396568 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4396569 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4396570 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4396571 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4396572 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4396573 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4396574 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4396575 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4396576 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4396577 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4396578 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4396579 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4396580 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4396581 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4396582 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4396583 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4396584 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4396585 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4396586 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4396587 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4396588 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4396589 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4396590 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry
4396591 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4396592 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4396593 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4396594 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4396595 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4396596 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4396597 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4396598 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4396599 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4396600 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4396601 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4396602 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4396603 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4396604 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4396605 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4396606 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4396607 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4396608 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4396609 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4396610 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4396611 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4396612 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4396613 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4396614 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4396615 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4396616 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4396617 we are in the process now of building a youth center and you would be surprised at the people that can be helped with 600 000
4396618 anything extra is bonus so that would be an extra blessing of offering after that so if i did win lotto sweepstakes i would tithe to my church
4396619 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4396620 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4396621 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4396622 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4396623 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4396624 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4396625 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4396626 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4396627 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4396628 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4396629 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4396630 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4396631 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4396632 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4396633 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4396634 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4396635 who are open to doing something on the production side
4396636 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4396637 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4396638 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4396639 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4396640 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4396641 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4396642 it seems to me that if you allow people to enter your legislatures without asking them any questions as to what they are going to do when they get there you are not exercising your citizens rights and your citizens duties as you ought
4396643 we are concerned for them and we wait with bated breath until we know they are safe
4396644 some other protesters have been roughed up people have been threatened assaulted punched and kicked clearly we are striking a nerve but our protest is not with the chinese police in beijing but the hardline leadership which has refused to listen to reasoned arguments about tibet

4396701 manabu corrected himself he had horrible timing but there had been something about the speculative look in the other mans eyes and he wanted to pull him out of his shell wanted yuuto to look at
4396702 you cant punish yuuto and not me whatever whatever you decide ill do it even if you want me to leave the band ill do it i understand
4396703 you know that when i say punishment im talking about sexual punishment dont you
4396704 you realize that everything goes on behind that door is consensual if yuuto felt that he shouldnt be punished he wouldnt have gone back there and we would have talked it out our love life is separate from the band i wouldnt punish him for something that happened during practice and i wouldnt ask you to leave over this as if byou and kazuki would let me
4396705 manabu jumped when jin cupped his cheek stroked the smooth skin with his thumb
4396706 you wont pick a word if it makes you feel better

4396731 repite con normalidad sus siete t tulos mundiales son una buena carta de presentaci n
4396732 es la prueba que he preparado m s la que tengo m s opciones pero s que es dif cil ganar hay muchos rivales y en la prueba por puntos no sirven de mucho los pron sticos
4396733 compa eros de equipo y casi del mismo pa s lo que puede notarse en la carrera como sucedi en el mundial
4396734 hay otros candidatos como el australiano meyer el ingl s newton el belga keisse o incluso el uruguayo wynants pero
4396735 yo s que estoy en un buen momento pero sospecho que los rivales tambi n llegan bien las medallas ser n caras
4396736 la gente se juega mucho y va a tener que darlo todo si quiere optar a medalla
4396737 no hemos corrido nunca y hemos entrenado muy poquito pero no renunciamos a dar la sorpresa lo intentaremos pero siendo realistas tenemos menos opciones de las que ten amos a priori
4396738 la temperatura es baja y creo que cada d a est bajando un poco eso me preocupa ponen el aire acondicionado demasiado alto
4396739 la presi n me la pongo yo no necesito nada suplementario para pon rmela
4396740 utah has the best non bcs talent in the country
4396741 these activities have been introduced in response to feedback received from young people and their parents and aims to improve the opportunities and lifestyles for young people
4396742 engaging in such positive activities will hopefully lead to less anti social behaviour across the borough and promote a sense of responsibility and citizenship within our communities
4396743 i would encourage as many young people as possible to take advantage of this exciting opportunity
4396744 as well as promoting health and wellbeing our activities offer young people an opportunity to network with one another improving self esteem discipline and respect
4396745 previous projects have resulted in uncovering unhidden talent and promoting community cohesion participation in our activities could lead to sports leader awards youth achievement awards and duke of edinburgh this is a fantastic offer and one not to be missed
4396746 dont tease me like that baby youll get my hopes up
4396747 and that is how you win even if your ass was the one that was grabbed
4396748 how long are you going to play around in your closet
4396749 i think uruha is asking how long were going to have to suffer through your denial of your homosexuality
4396750 you know aoi that is kind of a girly pose
4396751 he came out five years ago how could you possibly forget
4396752 at any rate regardless of who paints their nails and trims the landscape i think it is obvious that aoi and i
4396753 are very masculine compared to others in this band and other bands really were just very manly
4396754 the fact reita and i can pat each other on the ass is an expression of our support for each other and of how very secure we are in our sexuality which would be of the heterosexual orientation
4396755 because the way youve got your arms around each other is so very straight
4396756 i thought you grabbed each others ass to see who could remain composed and act like nothing happened
4396757 yeah like that game from middle school what was it called
4396758 oh whats that look at the time come on aoi
4396759 i think reita just accidentally mentioned that he shaves down there
4396760 oh i thought he had walked in on one of us
4396761 ruki completely so that only leaves you and me kai is there something you want to show me
4396762 lets just say that hes added another level to the game
4396763 you shouldnt bend over like that its like an open invitation you need to keep your guard up
4396764 you know i hate to kick a man when hes down but
4396765 fuck i thought youd be the harder one to crack
4396766 and we never knew uruha is going to kick himself he thinks hes always right about these things
4396767 oh i think its safe to start looking for a home on your side of the fence
4396768 this game has gotten out of control im done with it
4396769 if it bothers you that much then i wont do it on stage
4396770 im older than you and therefore wiser and more experienced
4396771 yes but youre still in the vegetable hating video game playing stage of your life mentally its at least a decade
4396772 look reita a hand is a hand and a mouth is a mouth
4396773 thats why it doesnt bother me pleasure has no sexual orientation
4396774 and even if you say a hole is a hole you wont be saying that when its your hole and someone elses dick
4396775 you have such a way with words its like poetry to my soul
4396776 does it bother you that uruha and ruki like men or is it okay because they also like women
4396777 no i could care less about that you like who you like it pisses me off my virtue is being corrupted me my virtue mine
4396778 i think the real problem is that youre being corrupted so easily
4396779 you dont just go around grabbing a mans package and kissing him when you feel like it not polite dammit
4396780 is it really so bad being attracted to a man
4396781 someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed or seat in the van as it were
4396782 reita hoped that the blush he felt crawling up his cheeks wasnt obvious but he saw the guitarists reflection smirk
4396783 i have a chibi pervert after me who has a problem with the concept of personal space and all of my bandmates are gay tell me what part of this is supposed to make me happy
4396784 you win alright game over im done pushing my gayness onto you just stop fucking up the band over it
4396785 well it does with you but you liking men i dont care
4396786 so eloquent then why are you acting like a prick
4396787 i just i motherfuck ruki didnt it bother you the first time a guy gave you a hard on
4396788 did you agonize over every erection you had during puberty
4396789 think about it reita you probably got hard over stupid shit did you worry when the bus hit a bump in the road when you were in middle school did you think you had a fetish for large automotive vehicles
4396790 right so why are you being such a girl if some ugly old woman grabbed my dick well okay no i wouldnt get hard but listen to aoi a hand is a hand
4396791 i am not your cock confessional go find a when aoi what
4396792 i bring drinks and youre already naked looks like i didnt need the alcohol after all
4396793 aoi said hesitantly but reita looped his towel behind the guitarists neck and pulled him close stopping the rest of his words with the press of his chapped lips against aois smooth ones
4396794 because aois experienced this and you have no fucking idea what youd be doing
4396795 no but hes had my fingers in his ass so he knows how to prep you
4396796 youre so tight i bet you cant wait to feel my cock inside you
4396797 but if you dont fucking move i might kill you
4396798 i swear to fuck if you two dont get off of me
4396799 i cant believe everyone in this band is gay what are the odds of that happening
4396800 were in an industry of good looking men who wear makeup to make themselves even more attractive not to mention the occasionally girly costumes and exposed skin i think the odds are pretty good
4396801 strictly speaking only kai is gay well and possibly you two i dont remember the last time either of you dated a girl
4396802 aoi he cooks and cleans and mothers everyone its obvious he would totally be a housewife if he didnt like being in a band so much
4396803 yeah one of those scary housewives that makes dominatrix porn on the side
4396804 no im not and yes it is like i said housewife who makes dominatrix porn
4396805 wait so is he saying that kai has a secret life as an amateur porn star or he is saying that kai likes to cross dress or is he saying that kai has a kinky sex life
4396806 i think its the latter two kai wouldnt be an amateur porn star it would be bad for the band if it got out well it would be good for publicity but i think kai knows that no publicity is better than negative publicity its not like were desperate or anything
4396807 kai looks and acts like a total bottom though except for the occasional glimpse of his inner leader sama and i ah might possibly have seen him with uruha definitely on bottom
4396808 im right here you jackasses kai is a bottom unless its kink in which case he will top you and wear a skirt to do it because hes an asshole like that
4396809 its probably pretty humiliating getting topped by a man wearing a skirt who regularly takes it up the ass
4396810 im going to assume that youre speaking from past experience
4396811 how are you on bottom during vanilla sex and on top otherwise
4396812 he was worried that there would be issues when you two eventually came to realize that you liked each other since you were both so obviously in denial so i stepped in to speed the process along and head off any conflicts the band that gays together stays together

4396822 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4396823 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4396824 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4396825 should safe passage be given to someone who has done this to pakistan
4396826 he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans law he wants safe passage by breaking pakistans constitution he is asking for safe passage by selling out pakistans sovereignty
4396827 the federal reserve will issue data for the growth of industrial production for july in june this index of economic growth increased 0 5 and the consensus for july is for no change my forecast is for a 0 1 increase the federal reserve industrial production index is a broad indicator encompassing mining manufacturing construction and gas and electric utilities along with the july jobs report which was negative july industrial production is a key first look at gdp growth for the third quarter last month the sectors increasing the most were mining reflecting the boom in resource prices and utilities key numbers to watch most are manufacturing and construction supplies in june manufacturing was up 0 2 after two monthly declines manufactured exports have started to increase again and this should be reflected in this index however if imports and slack domestic demand are hammering manufacturing the manufacturing index could go negative as it did in april and may that would be a signal that third quarter gdp growth is off to a slow start the construction industry continues to drag under the weight of the housing slowdown and now public infrastructure and commercial construction are expected to slow too the construction supplies index which provides needed materials in construction was down 0 9 in june the economy is not going to recover without a better showing from construction look to construction supplies for an early indicator of improvement when it comes

4396834 scolari is prepared for this challenge i have seen him show a lot of spirit and hunger to succeed
4396835 i have no doubt he will be a success in the premier league he only needs a little time to adapt to what is going on scolaris position at chelsea was crucial to my decision to join this club
4396836 we have two realistic chances of winning trophies this year and that is the setanta cup and the fai cup
4396837 i think the fai cup is more important as it guarantees a uefa cup spot and that is something that drogheda needs we are full time and are looking at going into a new stadium so we need to have european football
4396838 when i signed for drogheda i left longford at a time when they were going into europe and it was a big decision drogheda didnt have that but the bigger picture was to guarantee that every year
4396839 now we are in negotiations with tottenham and some clarity is likely to come on friday evening

4396850 we are aware of the political implications of everything let us move forward ghana has got one of the best deals mr speaker we are moving forward there is no better offer
4396851 water and electricity were critical drivers of development in any society and every effort must be made to ensure that the services were available and affordable at all times
4396852 in doing this the media must exercise circumspection and tact in reportage guided by the tenets of accuracy fairness and balance
4396853 a greedy and smart schemer who smartly dissolved ghana tours to escape being caught up by the law
4396854 ghana tours bowed out because of a unilateral decision taken by air namibia which we have entered into lease agreement with and not because of bad practices nana korkyirem ii should come out to tell us what he thinks are bad practices
4396855 i was not the manager of the company in ghana and therefore not in the position to make all the decisions so why should nana korkyirem ii accuse me of bad practices
4396856 ever since then he became so disappointed and angry even though i was not part of the decision and all efforts to calm him down proved futile
4396857 i believe somebody is pushing nana korkyirem ii to misbehave towards me
4396858 i formed ghana tours but i am not part of gold coast travels caledonia tours and meridian atlantic
4396859 we the undersigned members of the youth wing of the new patriotic party in obuasi pledge our sincere and total support for the nomination of our constituency youth organizer samuel amoako otchere as the mce for obuasi
4396860 mr otchere is youthful but mature in thinking and this is seen from the selfless role he played and continues to play before and during his university education first as tescon executive polling station chairman and currently obuasi constituency youth organizer of our dear party
4396861 above all these qualities he is a development planner from knust and since the problems facing the municipality are developmental he could be of great benefit to the development agenda of the assembly
4396862 given the detrimental effects of malnutrition on human resource development it is not surprising that the university of ghana which is a major stakeholder in developing the human resource capacity of our nation is collaborating with lowa state university and other partners in research and interventions to improve the nutritional status of ghanaian children
4396863 it had been identified as priority countries for interventions to improve child survival
4396864 by so doing we shall rejoice that our efforts and sacrifices have not been in vain
4396865 if parliament had ratified the deal before the friday that it went on recess the central bank would have maintained its benchmark indicator the prime rate and hence keeping interest rates at bay

4396886 we want to train and work with the u s army
4396887 we like our job here of running the traffic control point and providing security at the entrance of the patrol base
4396888 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the traffic control point but we are going to train them to be able to take over the entire patrol base go and do presence patrols and set up temporary traffic control points in our area
4396889 we are integrating with the isf to make us a better fighting force
4396890 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people

4396976 katanya kau mau diajak senang senang bagaimana kita bisa senang senang kalau belum apa apa kau sudah takut pada manusia lagipula kau mahluk dari dunia seram masa takut sama mimpi buruk
4396977 tidak ada tapi pokoknya kau tenang sajalah bollum manusia toh tak bisa melihat kita kalau kita tidak memperlihatkan diri pada mereka kau kan tahu itu bollum
4396978 kan kau yang menyuruh kita asal datang saja tanpa melihat peta bumi biar lebih seru tapi itu tidak penting yang penting kita ke sini untuk senang senang
4396979 bodoh kau kau kira manusia masih ada yang bangun malam malam begini hah bollum
4396980 memangnya sebelum datang ke sini kau tidak pernah riset dulu tentang dunia manusia jam segini ini biasanya manusia dewasa suka melakukan kegiatan yang dinamakan siskamling tahu
4396981 begitu saja kok pakai memberi istilah yang merepotkan segala bilang saja jaga malam kan mudah
4396982 ah ssttt sudahlah jangan cerewet lagi belum tentu kan manusia di tempat ini melakukan penjagaan seperti yang kau bilang aku pernah ke dunia manusia sebelumnya tapi tidak pernah bertemu dengan yang namanya si maling tadi
4396983 kalau ini malam ngapain kita ada di sini bollum kita kan jadi tidak bisa menonton manusia dan bersenang senang dengan mereka
4396984 yaaah untuk apa datang ke dunia manusia kalau manusianya saja masih tidur
4396985 sekarang kita terjebak di dunia manusia yang membosankan lebih baik kita kembali ke rumah dan memeriksa peta bumi baik baik agar kita bisa memilih dulu waktu dan tempat yang menyenangkan
4396986 menyebalkan sekarang kita harus menunggu dulu sampai pagi dan manusia manusia itu bangun huh kau dengar tidak bollum kita pulang dulu sekarang bollum hei bollum
4396987 lihat pohon ini jocco begitu rindang dan harum hmm rasanya pasti sangat lezat
4396988 sungguh tak percaya di tempat manusia masih ada pohon yang lezat seperti ini
4396989 kau tidak mau ikut makan jocco kita tidak usah pulang lebih baik kita makan dulu sambil menunggu manusia manusia ini bangun ya kan pulang ke rumah hanya buang buang tenaga saja apalagi melihat peta lagi kenapa kita melakukan sedikit observasi saja dulu terhadap tempat ini siapa tahu ada hal yang menarik
4396990 ki jangan lupa nanti sore kita main bola di lapangan belakang ya
4396991 eh kalian juga jangan lupa ya ini sabtu sore waktunya main bola kita nanti sore tanding lho
4396992 maaf ya telat tadi aku disuruh ibuku bantu bantu dulu
4396993 tadi itu zahra lagi main di rumahnya irva ada sila juga terus aku ditanya mau ke mana ya aku jawab mau main bola sama kalian eh ternyata dia malah mau ikut main juga katanya irva sama sila juga jadi pengen ikutan ke sini

4396995 ah bohong kalian ada sembilan orang berarti kelebihan kan tambah aku malah jadi pas ada sepuluh
4396996 aku nggak mau seregu sama anak cewek ini main bola bukannya main masak masakan
4396997 eh yon emangnya kalau cewek nggak boleh main bola gitu kalo gitu kenapa siti boleh main
4396998 bukannya gitu plastik itu kan butuh waktu yang sangat lama untuk bisa membusuk plastik juga bahan yang berbahaya untuk tanah bisa terjadi pencemaran dibakar juga nggak boleh kalau dibuang dengan benar seenggaknya plastik itu bisa dimanfaatkan untuk apaan gitu
4396999 nggak tahu aku baca di majalah kakakku tentang cara cara pencegahan kerusakan lingkungan katanya kita nggak boleh buang sampah sembarangan jangan boros pakai listrik juga nggak boleh mencemari udara semua itu bisa merusak bumi katanya cuma itu sih aku tahunya
4397000 oh aku pernah lihat di tv waktu itu ada berita itu lho yang katanya es es di daerah kutub pada mencair terus beruang beruang kutub pada mati karena kehilangan habitatnya
4397001 asal tau aja ya aku ini main bolanya lebih jago daripada kamu
4397002 nanti kalau jatuh nangis terus yang disalahin kita yang dikira ngajak main bola
4397003 kita ke sini mau main bola bukan berantem emang kenapa tho kalo zahra ikutan main nggak apa apa kan
4397004 kita trix and flix trix and flix beraksiiiiiiii kalian semua boleh mengalah dan lari daripada kami mulai beraksi dan unjuk gigi
4397005 bollum bangun manusia manusia itu sudah bangun semuanya kita bisa senang senang sekarang
4397006 benar jocco benar mereka sudah bangun semuanya dan mereka melakukan semacam permainan ya kan permainan apa itu namanya jocco sepertinya asyik sekali
4397007 tapi jocco kenapa manusia itu kecil kecil semua kukira manusia itu ukurannya tiga bahkan empat kali lipat besarnya daripada kita
4397008 wah jocco kalau anak anak manusia saja besarnya sudah lebih daripada kita sekarang aku percaya kalau manusia sebenarnya itu aslinya jauh lebih besar eh tapi ada juga manusia anak anak yang kecil sekali tuh yang di sana yang sedang berteriak teriak
4397009 kak zahra kak sion kak kiki kok aku nggak pernah dikasih bola siiihhh
4397010 iyan udah di belakang aja sini bantuin kak riko kalo nanti kak siti nyerang kiki siti tuh
4397011 kau tahu jocco aku tidak pernah menyangka manusia ternyata sangat ribut ya
4397012 kau tahu jocco manusia yang tadi duduk di bangku itu mengingatkanku pada seorang peri
4397013 jadi apa rencanamu berikutnya jocco katamu kita mau bersenang senang
4397014 kita akan menonton kegiatan manusia sehari hari mengganggu sedikit kalau memang dirasa perlu untuk menciptakan sedikit suasana asyik
4397015 tidak ada yang melarang kita untuk mencampuri urusan manusia kan bollum
4397016 hmm aku tidak berani bilang aku tahu tentang aturan bangsa kita jocco
4397017 aku punya suatu ide nih bollum tapi aku tidak bisa memberitahumu sekarang aku masih ingin menonton manusia manusia kecil ini untuk beberapa saat lagi
4397018 tadi siapa yang bilang aku nggak boleh ikut main bola
4397019 ceritanya ada dua kerajaan yang rebutan apa ya rebutan kekuasaan gitu deh ada yang pura pura jadi raja ratu pangeran ksatria putri prajurit kayak yang di dongeng dongeng itu lho
4397020 jangan ya yan iyan kan masih kecil belum bisa jadi raja
4397021 kalau mereka bingung ingin bermain apa bagaimana kalau kita yang mengajak mereka bermain
4397022 hei aku ingin bersenang senang bollum dan anak anak manusia ini tampaknya bisa memberikan kesenangan asal kita mau sedikit ikut campur dengan memberikan mereka tempat permainan yang mereka inginkan
4397023 dan selagi bermain mereka akan memberikan kita sebuah hiburan yang menarik
4397024 kita akan menunggu mereka di rumah hmm aku pasti tidak akan sabar menunggu malam mereka tiba dan
4397025 kiki ini di mana ki aduh kepalaku sakit banget ki
4397026 manusia itu tidak punya kekuatan apa apa ya selain bikin ribut dan menendang nendang bulatan hitam putih itu
4397027 kita tidak bisa membiarkan mereka seperti ini saja jocco ternyata manusia itu tidak hebat kita harus menambah keterlibatan kita kalau mau membuatnya jadi seru
4397028 ya ya bollum benar sekali kalau mereka lemah seperti ini pasti ceritanya hanya akan berakhir dengan cepat sia sia saja kalau begitu kita membawa mereka ke sini
4397029 soalnya aku tadi udah nyubit ify sampai bangun dan dia balas nyubit aku
4397030 rasanya sakit banget makanya ini pasti bukan mimpi tadinya sih aku mau cubit kamu juga ki abis kamu nggak bangun bangun
4397031 nggak ada yang tahu ki aku aja baru dibangunin sama gabriel pas sebelum mimpi dinding dinding wajah yang kamu bilang tadi ki
4397032 kalian berdua tergeletak gitu aja di dekat aku karena takut aku bangunin kalian berdua tapi kalian nggak bangun bangun yang bikin aku penasaran kenapa kita bisa ada di tempat kayak gini ya
4397033 mungkin nggak sih kita masuk acara reality show kayak survivor itu lho tapi dibawa secara diam diam
4397034 mana ada acara kayak gitu pakai anak anak buat main
4397035 kalau aku bilang sih ini pasti sihir keajaiban ada sesuatu yang bawa kita ke sini sesuatu yang magis
4397036 terus alasannya kita bisa ada di sini apa jadinya kalo gitu
4397037 aku yakin di indonesia nggak ada reality show yang pake acara bawa anak anak seumuran kita ke hutan kalaupun iya orangtua kita pasti nggak akan mengizinkan mana ada orang yang mau ngebiarin anak anaknya ikutan acara berbahaya kayak gini
4397038 dan aku yakin banget kalo mamaku nggak akan pernah membiarkan aku ikutan acara tv apapun tanpa ngasih tahu aku dulu
4397039 kalau ketemu akan kucincang dia kecil kecil sebelum menjadikannya umpan singa
4397040 ini bau bau yang sama seperti bau monyet kecil itu teman teman bau anak anak

4397047 cuma berani lawan anak anak eh tapi tidak pernah punya nyali untuk menghadapi kami children of earth anak anak bumi ya kan
4397048 kalian hanya sekelompok anak kecil curang yang tidak tahu caranya bertarung dengan benar
4397049 kau benar benar menyakiti hati kami kami tidak pernah curang kalian saja yang terlalu bodoh sehingga gampang dikibulin
4397050 apalagi membawa temanmu yang bengal ini ragon bukankah kalian sudah diberi peringatan akan apa yang bisa menimpa diri kalian kalau kalian masih berani menginjak hutan eleazar kami
4397051 hutan ini hanyalah perbatasan antara negeri kalian dan pulau kami sama sekali bukan punya siapa siapa kalian ini hanya sepasukan anak bodoh bodoh
4397052 huh napasmu bau sekali dasar gorgon lamban kau tak akan bisa menjatuhkanku dengan napasmu yang bau itu tahu

4397061 siapa yang jahat kayak gorgon aku enggak jahat aku juga nggak pernah membunuh dan memakan daging manusia seperti ragon
4397062 pakaian apa yang kalian pakai itu di tempat seperti ini tidak seharusnya kalian memakai baju yang minim perlindungan seperti itu
4397063 lihat saja mereka sama sekali tidak bersenjata tidak memakai baju pelindung dan kelihatannya sama sekali tidak berguna
4397064 kamu kamu itu ify mervia ify mervia pelindung hutan eleazar ify mervia sahabat semua mahluk hidup di hutan ini

4397084 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events
4397085 persons aged 15 44 years accounted for an estimated 41 per cent of emergency department visits
4397086 infants accounted for only an estimated 6 3 per cent of ed visits
4397087 in three districts of the north rift valley iom is carrying out in depth household assessments through its psychosocial programme to identify particularly vulnerable families

4397103 i personally guarantee that these investigations will not turn out to be a farce
4397104 scandal amicably in fact the later case seemed to be handled with incredible quickness almost as though someone wanted it to be forgotten and as thaksin made good his promise to return to thailand after the elections it seemed things would finally be resolved decision not to allow thaksin to leave before his first hearing was impressive but after potjamon was found guilty of tax evasion she was sentenced to three years in jail yet amazingly the papers public and media immediately speculated that exile was an option but with thaksins numerous promises to face justice and his faith in the system people were not sure that is they were not sure until yesterday when the shinwatras now i dont pretend to be a legal expert so i would be most grateful if anyone can tell me how many cases have there been in thailand when a person sentenced to three years is released on bail and allowed to leave the nation i think this actions is wrong for many reasons its wrong because thaksin shinwat told his supporters ad nauseam that he would return and clear his name after elections in thailand now he has changed his tune its wrong because a person was allowed to leave the country under bail even when the general public knew what would happen its will be wrong if the uk allows thaksin to stay in the country when and if he is found guilty of an offence that is also indictable in the uk threats against my life and my family
4397105 it is not only weird but plain wrong that we still do not read in thai history books what the role was of the killers of class 7 led by the likes of prem tinsulonda kriangsak and chamlong
4397106 they all had in common that they were just like the old bullies educated by foreigners in this case the americans employed them they gathered intelligence we all know what americans mean with gathering intelligence in times of war or looming war for the americans in south vietnam
4397107 chamlong prem and krangsak did so with as most visible and know achievement the mass murder at thammasat university at 6 october 1976
4397108 poor people after all will in general show leftist behaviour being robbed by the likes of chamlong from their dignity they want a honest piece of the economic cake
4397109 make no mistake the class 7 alumni are killers they have showed their disrespect for human life over and over again
4397110 he blew up his palang darma party after winning a stunning 318 seats in parliament in 1988
4397111 half of them were from his chanti asoke sect unimaginable in any developed country
4397112 he was spit out by the people when they learned about his role in the thammasat massacre
4397113 i do offer 10 000 bhat to anyone who punched chidchob and i said if it was chamlongs blood i would pay 20 000 bhat but it was a joke i didnt mean it to be taken seriously
4397114 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4397115 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council
4397116 the resolution of kosovos status is covered by a u n security council resolution and that resolution envisions an international process so the two cases are totally different

4397125 it could be a real nightmare to get 76 000 people into invesco field
4397126 do we close the interstate or will the protesters thats a very big issue
4397127 if you identify the anarchists early and they engage in criminal behavior snatch them up right now
4397128 the further you delay the more damage they can do to the process of legitimate protest
4397129 sen obama believes that one of the principal problems facing the economy today is the lack of discretionary income for middle class wage earners
4397130 thats why his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000 not income taxes capital gains taxes dividend or payroll taxes
4397131 the reality of barack obamas record is the following he has voted to raise taxes 94 times in his short time as a senator
4397132 barack obama can say it but it doesnt make it true
4397133 the opinion piece that we saw today in the wall street journal is part of a path that obamas taking which takes him back more towards the middle more towards mccains policies
4397134 were pleased to see that because there is tremendous uncertainty over obamas plans for the economy and for the stock market and for the markets overall

4397136 this agreement will settle the last major issue which is compensation

4397138 should the secretary decide at some point that it makes sense to go to libya then she will do that
4397139 i urge the bush administration to use this opportunity to assert americas interests in a broader relationship that will put libya on a more sustainable and more democratic path
4397140 this deal will help foreign firms push further into libyas oil upstream and increase libyas hydrocarbon receipts and prestige on the international stage

4397192 the nhl for 15 years has brought young players from europe first and foremost from russia
4397193 i think that it is time to end this simply put its time to stop robbing us
4397194 i probably hit 18 greens and i dont remember chipping so that was good too
4397195 it always feels good when you have no bogeys on your scorecard
4397196 i think my game has always been there its more emotionally sometimes you have ups and downs and distractions and youre tired
4397197 ive played solid the last couple of weeks ive had my rest and my time to practise and get motivated i dont want to get too far ahead this is just one round hopefully it will continue to go in this direction
4397198 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts
4397199 i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased this course is tough and five under id take that any day here
4397200 id say the difference between the back nine and the front is the greens theyre not as undulating
4397201 but i want to say i had a career putting round
4397202 i went down to triple a and tried to improve my game
4397203 we had to go to our bullpen we didnt have the guys out there that wed normally have
4397204 its just going to be a matter of what i can tolerate
4397205 mccabe hasnt even said he would accept being traded yet were working on it
4397206 he has not been traded as of yet and if he does agree to be moved to a certain team we will try to see what we can do to make it happen it hasnt happened yet
4397207 we continue to talk to the leafs about whether he is going to remain a leaf or move to another team technically he wont waive the no trade until there is a trade and there hasnt been a trade
4397208 having said that he may remain a leaf theres a lot of things to discuss
4397209 i feel better than i have in a long long time
4397210 were trying to prove to ourselves and the league and everybody else that toronto is an nfl town as well as a cfl town theres room for both but theres certainly room for nfl games in toronto
4397211 the fact that this game will be a great success leads to the fact that tonight therell be more people in the stands for the argos than there would have been otherwise we think that a rising tide raises all boats
4397212 toronto is the fifth largest population centre in north america it stands to reason that theyre looking this way
4397213 if we can prove this experiment i think the contract of some games in buffalo and some games in toronto makes a lot of sense
4397214 therell always be fans in buffalo who say not toronto
4397215 if ralph wilson passes away none of this will make any difference anyway
4397216 is youre better off losing at this stage than at the tail end of the tournament when you cant do anything about it
4397217 if we continue in that fashion well definitely be in the medal round
4397218 we just made a name for ourselves against the best team in the world
4397219 no ones taking us lightly that was our game tonight
4397220 theres no mystique we know when we come out there were in for a game no matter what
4397221 from the first inning on it doesnt matter what the score is you cant let up on them they always try to come back
4397222 i have those feelings every night when this team takes the field tonights the night
4397223 i know it cost a lot of money but its the love of the game
4397224 i know i dont come see the argos but thats not my team this is the nfl its the biggest stage
4397225 theres more free tickets on the street than ive ever seen for any event
4397226 to me the nfl is a boring game the cfl is much better
4397227 i just want to keep the nfl out of canada and the cfl alive
4397228 when i first heard our voices blend i said theres something special about that
4397229 it was like ok weve got to pursue this then i looked around and sonny stopped playing in the osborne brothers jim mcreynolds from jim amp jesse passed away all of a sudden there werent any duos in bluegrass anymore i thought this is going to be a lost thing if we dont form a duo it just made sense
4397230 but i knew probably after being with doyle three years that eventually i would want to step away in order for me to fulfill what was in my heart and to get to do everything i wanted to do musically
4397231 because we were making sure that its the right choice he jamie was making really good money and doing great with doyle ive been having a ball with ricky with all the awards that weve won and all the wonderful opportunities that have come along with ricky it really didnt make sense to quit
4397232 when we got the response we did off of beautiful star it was overwhelming

4397251 many local authorities have added their voice to growing calls for an end to licensing of lap dancing clubs as cafes
4397252 the solution to this problem does not lie in tinkering with the licensing act 2003 or in planning controls the solution lies in licensing lap dancing clubs for what they are venues that provide visual entertainment for sexual stimulation in other words sex encounter establishments we call on the government to restore democracy to the licensing process and send out a powerful message that buying a lap dance is not the same as buying a cappuccino
4397253 a lax licensing regime has led to the proliferation of lap dancing clubs in uk
4397254 the only viable solution is to license lap dancing clubs as sex encounter establishments this would untie the hands of local authorities and enable them to fulfill their duties under the gender equality duty alongside local authorities across the country we urge the government to enact reform and give local communities a voice

4397404 tal y como estamos entrenando es factible hacer un buen partido all
4397405 fue bastante complicado han defendido bastante bien nos ha faltado un poco de acierto en jugadas a bal n parado y en alguna ocasi n si hubi semos hecho un gol hubiese cambiado el partido pero hemos mantenido la porter a a cero y eso es importante

4397409 bupa provides cover for customary and reasonable charges incurred by our members who seek private medical care irrespective of where the private care is administered in line with the level of cover purchased we have recently signed agreements with private providers to establish a framework for simplifying payment transactions by creating a direct payment channel between bupa and the private providers this gives members the freedom to choose the facility of their preference eliminates the need for them to pay for care and seek reimbursement afterwards and thereby focus on getting well
4397410 the ride is a big challenge for all the cyclists particularly given the scorching heat in the visiting countries at this time of the year
4397411 this feat required months of very intense and hard training which we have all been very willing to do to support the renal unit at mater dei hospital we also encourage the public to lend its compassion and make a donation to help the renal unit provide its suffering patients with the best services for a better quality of life

4397414 anytime you do a massive reorganization there are going to be processes that you have to go through to make things work
4397415 but so far things are going well officers are responding and theyre stepping up to the plate
4397416 i think that a majority of the patrolmen are dedicated to their jobs enough that when given the opportunity theyre going to do their job to the best of their abilities
4397417 many of them are worried they wont be able to dedicate the time needed to the job under these circumstances
4397418 its an effort to respond to the governors call for increased accountability and transparency so that people can see how the administrators in their districts are being compensated
4397419 the residents of new jersey are rightfully outraged at seeing their tax dollars used to provide departing superintendents with these offense payouts
4397420 from a school boards point of view you want to be careful with the tax dollars but you also want to attract quality school leadership hiring a superintendent is probably the most important decision a school board will make
4397421 the districts administrators salaries and benefits are commensurate with their experience and extensive management responsibilities necessary to perform their duties effectively in a district the size of

4397425 it is really weird to not have addie with us dont you think mom
4397426 no one could believe peaches had invited faris round as soon as she got back never mind let him stay the night
4397427 they were a couple before she went to las vegas then she decides to get married on a whim comes back and rings up faris as if what she has done is the most normal thing in the world
4397428 she lives in a bubble and is loving all the attention but shes a married woman now and needs to grow up
4397429 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach
4397430 all i am trying to say is that i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
4397431 i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
4397432 its something that weve wanted to do and we want it to be legal and we are very very excited
4397433 i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous that we dont all have the same rights
4397434 planning a wedding is very stressful its crazy my gardener is now invited
4397435 it takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan
4397436 households who are concerned about their jobs their homes and their ongoing ability to pay their bills will be left with no choice but to cut back on both heating and eating this winter
4397437 they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army
4397438 very few people could have afforded to bury their child in such a grand fashion
4397439 at this time we would like to declare an emergency and also have cfr crash equipment standing by in st louis
4397440 in the future there will be no alternative for us so we as soldiers need to know where the enemy is and why this is where technology comes in
4397441 the bottom line is we want our technology to help our forces
4397442 hypsilophodon had elongated legs and a stiffened counterbalancing tail that suggest it was almost certainly a fast runner
4397443 the plates might have functioned to support the ribcage during fast running
4397444 that as the body of the dead hypsilophodon individual rotted and collapsed the bones from the skin came to be closely associated with the internal bones
4397445 our careful reexamination of the specimens shows however that the bony plates are always closely associated with the outside surface of the ribs from the front end of the ribcage and are certainly not armor
4397446 this happened because we started to eat better food like eating more meat
4397447 but the increase in size did not make humans as smart as they are today
4397448 we have initiated reform and modernization of government the national e governance plan will make it easier for all our citizens to deal with the various agencies of government
4397449 russias behaviour over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato

4397454 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4397455 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4397456 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4397457 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4397458 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives
4397459 these results have profound implications for advancing the performance and capabilities of lithographic materials and processes beyond current limits

4397462 the brief didnt go to criminality it wasnt concerned with any incriminating evidence against haneef but went to the question of his association with the guys in the uk who were suspected to have been involved in criminal conduct
4397463 all of this is damning of mr keelty and mr andrews who have both spent the last 13 months variously pretending that they had evidence incriminating dr haneef that they cannot share publicly
4397464 its obviously a male we looked at a very very large primate male it doesnt fit into any of the taxonomic groups i can think of

4397480 increase in military service pay of pbors and compensation for middle rung officers are particularly heartening the decision to credit arrears from january 01 2006 is most welcome
4397481 there are new challenges that we face we have the challenge of inflation i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4397482 all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising in many developing countries the rate of inflation is double that in india
4397483 we have taken special measures to insulate the poorer sections of our society from the full impact of rising food and fuel prices our government has not raised the price of kerosene and fertilizers we have not raised the issue price of wheat and rice under pds public distribution system
4397484 we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control i have urged all chief ministers to improve and strengthen the pds to ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at reasonable prices the reserve bank of india is moderating the growth of money supply in the country so that inflation can be controlled however while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our growth
4397485 the problem of malnutrition is a curse that we must remove our efforts to provide every child with access to education and to improve health care services for all citizens will continue
4397486 i promise to you that we will continue striving for the development and prosperity of our country we will work hard to take the country to greater heights in all fields
4397487 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4397488 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4397489 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of

4397501 we are only simple shepherds in faith we are near hands out of the door no wonder as it stands if we be poor we are so lamed overtaxed and maimed
4397502 if you want to make change you need to do so politically
4397503 i feel very proud that ive been part of this effort
4397504 my political experience is really from the grassroots level advocating for the community
4397505 not only to become activists but also to support community based groups and organize to make change in the community
4397506 if you have politicians that dont listen it creates cynicism and the current candidate is not listening
4397507 my campaign is not about me its about you us thats what it should be about
4397508 i have been a strong voice for students teachers and parents to play more of a role in decision making at the school district as well
4397509 i am going to bring this form of grassroots empowerment to the board of supervisors
4397510 also the school assignment issue brought up a lot of chinese opposition since many families wanted to send kids to washington high but because of the current assignment they cant parents are angry at mar
4397511 i feel we could use that money for the asian and non asian students in the program for better college access and career opportunities as well i think we can create discipline and leadership options for these students and not have the military in control of it
4397512 i think that raising children in the city is challenging enough there are not enough programs that provide constructive pathways for students it seems to me that jrotc is one of the pathways
4397513 a thousand families move out of the school district every year and in that sense i think that the school board needs to reconsider parents parents are taxpayers and they are essentially paying for the school it is bad policy and it is irresponsible on the part of the school to behave this way
4397514 raising money is the most difficult thing and when people look at the money they will see that i am not beholden to big businesses downtown interests or real estate developers i am someone who is genuinely in support of working families the middle class and small businesses in the neighborhood
4397515 i have accomplishments that i can point to that speak to my values and also speak to my approach in solving problems i am currently the executive director of the chinese historical society i run a non profit i run a staff of five and i know what it takes to run a business and to keep an organization afloat and i think this is also needed in the board of supervisors
4397516 on one side of the richmond there is the presidio on the other side there is ocean beach and there is park presidio cutting through the district district one is bound by federal land and cut by a highway my expertise and experience at the federal and state level will be very helpful in negotiating contracts for the district
4397517 my hope is that they also look at experience and who will be accountable to the community as well one thing about that too is that the richmond should be a place where there should be an asian supervisor
4397518 there should be asian elected officials throughout the city we should not shy away from these leadership positions
4397519 the city is reaching a point where the asian community needs to take leadership in the community

4397611 this is the olympics its a great honor for beijing so people are willing to contribute a little bit more than usual
4397612 theyve asked us to do something practical for the olympics
4397613 when the government needs to mobilize people it works through the residents committee and this time theyve been very successful
4397614 times have changed individual freedoms are beginning to be respected as they never were before the residence committees have lost practical meaning and soon will be placed in a museum like those beautifully embroidered three inch shoes
4397615 people are entitled to their opinion and not everyone thinks the same
4397616 obviously i could do with a few more weeks training
4397617 but i am here and i think the fact that im here and im strong very strong actually will be an advantage for me in the race too
4397618 i always knew it was a possibility for me my pediatrician told my mom when i was a child that given our family history it was more than likely that at least one of her four children would develop diabetes
4397619 i always felt that i would take care of myself and never allow myself to develop type 2
4397620 life happened and three years ago i found myself at the thresholds of diabetes
4397621 i started seeing all my bad habits come home to roost and i knew that i was really at risk for having my life shortened
4397622 if it had been i would have started filling out the paperwork because i didnt think i could lose weight on my own
4397623 i work for a hospital and johns hopkins has such a great reputation
4397624 i read the success stories and i told my husband i just wanted to try it for four weeks
4397625 ive been on every diet you can name and this is not only the only one that ever worked it is also the easiest i ever went on
4397626 it made everything that happened over this past year the food i couldnt eat while i was on the plan it made it all worthwhile i couldnt think of a slice of pizza or a brownie that was worth anything like hearing my doctor say those words
4397627 theyre losing weight and most of them have had their insulin cut in half
4397628 its been really exciting for me to see not only the weight loss and turnaround in my own health but to see that repeated in the lives of other people im working with
4397629 he saw me sticking to it and did everything he could to support me
4397630 he would eat the lean protein and the vegetable with me for dinner
4397631 between my husband and me we joke that theres 184 pounds less weight on our mattress
4397632 she went from feeling like this was just how it was going to be to being very hopeful shes optimistic that once she reaches her goal weight she might not need any insulin at all
4397633 if i didnt see anyone heavier than me i felt bad
4397634 if i did i felt relieved and then i felt really shallow
4397635 four years ago i went to cozumel and just walked around and shopped and i felt exhausted
4397636 i did all this stuff this time and got back to the ship did dinner saw a show and went to a karaoke bar
4397637 but i was dancing and i looked great im so much less self conscious i just want to go out there and do things and have fun
4397638 i made the decision to stay on the plan so there was a lot of emotional and spiritual growth that happened
4397639 i understand now that food is incapable of providing comfort
4397640 my big takeaway message is that its never too late to turn things around its never too late to make positive changes in your health
4397641 it doesnt matter if youre in your fifties sixties or seventies if youve just received a diagnosis of diabetes or if youve been on insulin for decades its possible to make positive choices that will change your health what youre dealing with now is not inevitable
4397642 nosotros los libres nos hallamos ante una ocasi n de proporciones gigantescas en las generaciones anteriores tambi n para la gente que viv a en lo que se llam el mundo libre un mundo libre no era m s que un sue o ahora podemos empezar a construirlo nunca ha habido tantas personas libres y nunca nuestras posibilidades de ayudar a los dem s a salir de la falta de libertad han sido tan grandes
4397643 se ve impotente para ayudar realmente a los m s necesitados de su pa s
4397644 no basta reformar la sociedad que est ah lo que importa es construir otro modelo de sociedad
4397645 its one of the reasons why we made some of the choices we made like when we pulled out the potion system
4397646 when we wanted to add a hot bar we knew we had to pull the potion stuff out every time we add something we have to pull something out to keep the game very simple and straightforward to play
4397647 was the player was faster than most of the monsters and had pretty much infinite health because they would just pop as many potions as they wanted so when you have a player who has more mobility more health and endless power essentially the only thing you can really do to challenge the players is to kill them by just spiking the difficulty
4397648 you have your collar on and will do exactly as i say with absolutely no question
4397649 you need to take the rest of your clothes off too
4397650 remember you are our slave tonight and you must do whatever we ask
4397651 you say yes master or yes mistress when you address julia or i
4397652 i think you are getting your own way a little too much beth
4397653 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take
4397654 my interpretation is that this a feature of increased awareness in the sports world that doping is unacceptable and you dont compete in the olympic games if you are doped
4397655 im puzzled as to why stec seems to be making all the running concerning the use of fibre channel interface ssds with its well known emc wins and other enterprise storage and server design wins coming stec reckons it has a 12 month advantage on any other ssd supplier in this market could bitmicro help me understand the market positioning of stec ssds and bitmicro ssds please also could bitmicro update me with its oem or other customers in the storage drive array space
4397656 they stec do have an advantage since they were first to get design wins on major storage oems particularly emc with their 1gfc and now 2gfc fc zeus iops drive although bitmicro is first to market with its 1gfc ssd in late 2002 now in its obsolescence stage most of the major storage oems chose to wait for our next generation 4gfc e disk altima ssd we expect its fcs to tier 1 storage oems in october this year
4397657 we believe stec and bitmicro are at the least both going after the enterprise market segment in the short term that is ssds to complement hdds in midrange and enterprise class disk arrays for tier 0 applications and also as performance accelerators in servers bladed servers and storage as das direct attached storage for logfile and cached file systems applications we also believe that stecs estimate of a 12 month lead is based on the amount of time that it took emc at the least to qualify the zeus iops fc drive we expect that succeeding qualification times for new ssds will come faster
4397658 this is the busy time of year when students head to college and theyre looking for deals on everything
4397659 verizon has the perfect solution for these cost conscious consumers who want reliable broadband speeds at a great value
4397660 we welcome the unexpected change recognizing that this is a case of forced disappearance and not just a kidnapping
4397661 i am convinced that honouring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4397662 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4397663 although im not sure anything will make some of them feel better
4397664 we cant travel without passports theres no point in any case the plane has left and tsvangirai has already gone back he has no patience for this
4397665 this is a loud message to sadc we have been trying to tell president mbeki about things like this and people wouldnt believe us but now here it is for all to see
4397666 oh yes of course we got our independence after how many talks hundreds and tens of meetings had been held
4397667 i am there at the talks to protect the will of the people and we are taking a principled stand i maintain a principled stand to defend the will of the people
4397668 industry sectors that have reported to us since 1998 have 1 improved air quality by cutting sulphur oxides sox by 69 per cent fine particles pm10 by 53 per cent nitrogen oxides nox by 12 per cent 2 reduced waste by 14 per cent 3 cut the number of serious pollution incidents by almost half from 884 to 462 since 2000
4397669 as a result of environment agency prosecutions the courts handed out 3 million in fines as well as almost 8 years behind bars and more than 170 days of community service businesses have benefited from our risk based approach to regulation and we will continue to work closely with them in the future to build on these successes
4397670 1 we are now seeing the impacts of climate change and must adapt to it as well as trying to mitigate the causes using resources like water and energy more efficiently and minimising waste are just three ways we can do this 2 much has been done to limit point source pollution we need to continue this work as well as tackling diffuse pollution there are still too many hazardous chemicals in the environment and damage is still being caused by nutrients coming from products like detergents and fertilisers
4397671 we need to tackle non compliance and the companies that deliberately break the law to make a quick profit they harm the environment threaten peoples health and damage the reputation of legitimate industry
4397672 milk production fell about 20m litres from june july 2006 so this years 13m litres is not quite as much but june july 2007 output fell about 50m litres
4397673 when there were surpluses of 0 5 1bn litres only 12 or 18 months ago it was a buyers market its now much more of a sellers market
4397674 i think producers feel that more now at ground level and there are people moving away from supplying retailers directly to supplying milk brokering groups
4397675 and 3p litre has been talked about as being needed to cover dairy farmers increased costs cheese prices have increased by 300 t and the expectation is that liquid prices could follow
4397676 shared a rigatoni with meat sauce with tom then had our cod with pancetta which comes with mashed potato
4397677 worries about an economic slowdown in the u s and europe and even japan are weighing on the oil market
4397678 with the dollar gaining strength against the euro and yen oil and other commodities have come down
4397679 oil is not so much a hedge against a falling dollar anymore
4397680 this pipeline problem has simply been ignored by the market
4397681 i think 112 is still a key support level for oil
4397682 what michael is doing it makes the rest of us look like
4397683 i wanted to step on it in the first 50 meters and try to get out to an early lead
4397684 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on thats all i wanted to do
4397685 what michael is doing it makes the rest of us look like
4397686 i wanted to step on it in the first 50 meters and try to get out to an early lead
4397687 i knew in the first half if i got a big enough lead i thought i could hang on thats all i wanted to do
4397688 if he wasnt in there i dont think id be as good
4397689 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4397690 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4397691 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying

4397694 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4397695 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4397696 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying
4397697 i notice that stress eating is something i do well
4397698 whatevers in the refrigerator is what gets put in the tank
4397699 its either curl up in the corner and cry or keep it light and try to get through it

4397705 it is this kind of agreement not the split between russia and united states over the problem of south ossetia that may have a greater impact on the growth in tensions in russian american relations
4397706 those are things were investigating right now we dont have any indication of motive as far as it deals with mr gwatney
4397707 the manager asked him if he needed to talk at that point he turned in his badge and left the building
4397708 when he left yesterday he voluntarily left we asked him whats going on do you want to talk about something it was lets talk it was not about termination
4397709 you dont ever know about people but thats the last thing in the world i would have ever considered
4397710 he was not a person of a lot of words but he did carry on conversations
4397711 and the crowd at this place was by far the strangest group of people i have ever seen pawtucket you win
4397712 number 36 if youre gonna heckle at least buy a program make an effort and show me something early or stop shouting if youre giving a guy a hard time for backing up a play in other words making a good baseball play youre too stupid and or drunk to heckle
4397713 a lot of people talk about the good football we play at arsenal but we are all in this game to win trophies and we havent done that
4397714 its difficult because when i signed for arsenal from monaco i knew i had the chance to win a lot of things but ive been here for almost three years and i still havent won anything
4397715 so now we have to realise that while its good to play nice football there are times when you need to be dirty to win a game
4397716 all the summer speculation passed over my head and is already behind me the most important thing now is to keep scoring for arsenal
4397717 i have a four year contract and im very happy here now i am fighting with my team mates to achieve something
4397718 i always felt that united would do it last year but i fancy chelsea this time

4397723 it was not as fast as i wanted to but that is down to a lack of hurdles races really
4397724 but i have got that one out of the way the hurdles is always a bit nerve wracking but then you can settle in for the high jump its an okay starting point
4397725 it feels good it is my first time in the olympic games so it was all a bit nerve wracking especially being in with asafa powell
4397726 i had a good finish but i would like to be up there at 20 and 30 metres as well so hopefully i can go out and do it in the quarter final
4397727 i have run 10 21 which is my second best time of the season its good but there is more to come
4397728 i got a bit nervous it is my first olympics heat winner doesnt mean nothing and the time doesnt mean nothing it is all about the final i am just happy to get by
4397729 i think this is a good start im gonna come back and give it large tonight
4397730 1 59 is much better for me it will get faster but i dont mind the faster the better i took a few knocks out there but showed my robustness

4397784 the committee has poked its nose out of the pocket of the coal sector long enough to tell the australian community that we will be the ones to carry the can for the mega profitable coal giants
4397785 the government needs to explain why the polluter shouldnt pay for cleaning up its own act and carry the risk of burying carbon pollution
4397786 this is a very important industry for the future of australia for the public interest and for the national interest

4397790 i wanted to make an affordable coffin which used as few resources as possible using minimal materials makes the coffin extraordinarily lightweight celebrants and funeral directors have been telling me it will give friends and family more choices in who carries their deceased loved one
4397791 its a completely different style of coffin its quite modern looking an eco coffin is generally coffin shaped a bit rustic looking and made out of pine
4397792 we have a funeral at the moment we are using one for we have had three or four used so far
4397793 i guess our only question is how eco is ply i suppose
4397794 but the interesting thing is its not really an economy option because most of them are made of solid timber they tend to cost a bit more than your average casket

4397814 as someone who started his professional life as a teacher i feel proud to say that our government has been giving special attention to the development of education in our country
4397815 while doing this we have taken special care of the interests and welfare of our armed forces and paramilitary forces and government employees working at lower levels in our civil services this is one more step in making government more efficient
4397816 increase in military service pay of pbors and compensation for middle rung officers are particularly heartening the decision to credit arrears from january 01 2006 is most welcome
4397817 there are new challenges that we face we have the challenge of inflation i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4397818 all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising in many developing countries the rate of inflation is double that in india
4397819 we have taken special measures to insulate the poorer sections of our society from the full impact of rising food and fuel prices our government has not raised the price of kerosene and fertilizers we have not raised the issue price of wheat and rice under pds public distribution system
4397820 we are taking determined measures to bring prices under reasonable control i have urged all chief ministers to improve and strengthen the pds to ensure availability of essential commodities to the common man at reasonable prices the reserve bank of india is moderating the growth of money supply in the country so that inflation can be controlled however while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our growth

4397845 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4397846 this restriction could negatively impact our competitive position and our earnings
4397847 the lack of ethics and conflict of interest in the congress and senate
4397848 brown eggs are local eggs and local eggs are fresh
4397849 i apologize for not knowing what wall street did to our mortgages
4397850 i had no idea how wall street restructured these loans
4397851 its just inevitable that foreclosures are going to spill into the 2009 market
4397852 it was so complicated its a nightmare a real estate credit crunch usually lasts six months and this one were in it almost a year and its still not straightened out
4397853 todays announcement is a significant step towards strengthening customer choice
4397854 this agreement will enable oneworld to compete effectively with rival global air alliances that have already received transatlantic antitrust immunity currently six airlines in skyteam and nine star alliance airlines have such immunity
4397855 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4397856 we are applying for eu us antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any us or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4397857 the scope clause in our current collective bargaining agreement does not include an exception for a joint business agreement between american airlines and another airline
4397858 management therefore needs apas consent before this joint business agreement can go forward
4397859 todays announcement illustrates that american airlines management can negotiate complex agreements on a timely basis when they want to do so
4397860 its indicative of managements misplaced priorities that they arent willing to apply the same sense of urgency toward negotiating new collective bargaining agreements with their employees
4397861 tell them what youre going to tell them tell them then tell them what you told them
4397862 ouch bitter much dm i have previously taken brad to task but be a little gracious
4397863 even though i see considerable pent up demand and im busier than ive ever been prices will be stagnant at best through next year
4397864 when we looked at the trade offs it seemed like a wise thing to do
4397865 i talked to the quarterbacks wednesday night and told them i thought all four of them competed very well it was a tough decision because at times different guys did different things im not disappointed in any of them
4397866 in the end though stephen was the most consistent at the quarterback position i told him it was his job for today and he would have to hold on to it nothing is set in stone except that he is our starter for the arkansas state game
4397867 its a lot of fun to be in this offense the amount of stuff you can do the different formations moving people around and all the different routes

4397871 nicely written nicely designed blog with lots of fantastic pictures which provoke your mind
4397872 what makes hush and listen so different is the level to which khalel the author appears to take his passion for writing into something far greater his words are terribly striking and any gay man is sure to be able to relate to at least one but more likely many of his pieces which he faithfully posts this is a definite must read for any gay man or for any poetic soul for that matter
4397873 hush and listen is a very unique blog the creator and author uses his creative mind and imaginative skills to write some very deep essays poems and words to read his talented imagery and photos that he uses not only excite my imagination but takes it to a whole new level when i add his words into the picture
4397874 its terrific the page is a treat to the eyes and hes khalel an expressive and poetic wordsmith definitely a blog worth getting to know

4397876 a very rivetting blogsite definitely a must visit website khalel the author is also in my contacts he also has a multiply site that is as equally as thought provoking and emotion weilding blogsite one of the best gay blogs i have ever seen
4397877 they realized they had no case whatsoever but wanted to get one more smear in before they headed for the bushes

4397883 two weeks ago at airventure i announced my departure from eclipse aviation a move that was required by the investors to pave the way for a new round of financing
4397884 i also announced that i would become vice chairman of etirc aviation s a r l one of eclipses investors and a key player in the proliferation of very light jets in europe and russia

4397891 the most requested feature for our software for several years has been the garmin 430
4397892 we have placed real garmin equipment in our high end trainers for many years but were reluctant to undertake such an expensive and time consuming project for our home and basic atd users without the support of garmin engineers
4397893 when we discovered the high quality gps developed by reality xp which uses garmins own simulation software as its foundation a strategic partnership was inevitable
4397894 their attention to detail and the accuracy of their work far exceeded our expectations by integrating their gns 430 software into elite and providing hands on control we have created the ultimate gps training platform in the most cost effective manner
4397895 in todays market there is little room to deliver simulation solutions that dont meet market expectations
4397896 at reality xp we are marrying best practices and experiences with the best in the industry from around the world to assure top notch simulation and we couldnt be more pleased that our first announced project will be with elite simulation solutions a company we respect and admire for their legacy pedigree and amazing talent
4397897 the act provided that all black people were subject to african customary law
4397898 the difficulty with african law is that it tends to marginalise african women
4397899 you must apply it and you cant do anything about it
4397900 however the right of culture may be exercised only in the manner consistent with the bill of rights
4397901 it is imperative that the situation be regulated by an act of parliament
4397902 it is predominantly people in rural areas that are subject to customary law many are women and comprise the poorest section of our population having access to family property empowers and uplifts the circumstances of those women and girls
4397903 we have a bill being tabled by parliament but the bill is not being fast tracked enough

4397930 het is niet uit te sluiten maar het is bijna onmogelijk te achterhalen wie verantwoordelijk is voor die aanvallen systemen die deelnemen aan de aanval zijn door cybercriminelen gekraakte en overgenomen systemen die staan overal in de wereld ook in amerika en wellicht ook in nederland
4397931 je moet er niet aan denken wat er gebeurt als in nederland het internetverkeer een week platligt
4397932 als een duitser een aanval in nederland uitvoert is hij relatief makkelijk op te sporen omdat daarover binnen de europese unie afspraken gelden maar een duitser die een netwerk in zimbabwe gebruikt is bijna onvindbaar zimbabwe werkt gewoon niet mee
4397933 denk maar aan de gevolgen van een aanval op een defensienetwerk dat ook een ziekenhuis bedient als er burgerslachtoffers vallen wordt de conventie van gen ve geschonden
4397934 als iemand militaire handelingen uitvoert moet hij volgens het oorlogsrecht herkenbaar zijn als militair maar als een hacker uit de burgermaatschappij een militair doel aanvalt wat is dan zijn status

4398000 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4398001 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4398002 i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points

4398005 die zahlen beobachten wir genau sie sind aber f r den arbeitsmarkt im moment nicht entscheidend
4398006 eine verl ssliche rechnung dazu ist erst im herbst m glich wenn die eckwerte der bundesregierung zur wirtschaftlichen entwicklung vorliegen
4398007 hektische konjunkturprogramme haben immer nur schulden hinterlassen das wollen wir nicht tun
4398008 das ist nur ein halber sieg f r die kunden denn der karlsruher richterspruch wird nicht f r sinkende stromkosten sorgen sondern nur den k nftigen anstieg d mpfen wer seine energierechnung senken will muss weiterhin sparen wo es geht denn f r sinkende strompreise k nnte erst ein wirklich florierender wettbewerb auf dem strom gro markt sorgen daf r aber gibt es zu wenig potente stromproduzenten die den vier regionalmonopolisten eon enbw rwe und vattenfall mit ihren zusammen 80 prozent marktanteil wirksam konkurrenz machen k nnten
4398009 bei den netzentgelten geht es nicht nur um ein rundes drittel des strompreises es geht auch darum zu welchen konditionen konkurrenten ihren strom liefern k nnen niedrigere durchleitungsgeb hren erm glichen mehr wettbewerb unmittelbar profitieren k nnen davon zwar nur jene stromkunden die aktiv werden und selbst den anbieter wechseln was aber immer mehr tun mittelbar hilft es auch anderen weil wachsende konkurrenz zumindest den preisanstieg im zaum h lt das urteil st rkt zugleich der bundesnetzagentur den r cken sie wird sich in zukunft leichter damit tun den betreibern in die parade zu fahren das verspricht ebenfalls mehr wettbewerb in einem markt der immer noch von wenigen gro konzernen gepr gt ist
4398010 mehr kapazit ten in der stromerzeugung zu schaffen mehr anbieter in den markt zu lassen und absprachen zu unterbinden sind die einzig erfolgversprechenden wege die preisexplosion zu stoppen das bgh urteil hat daf r einen wichtigen baustein geliefert indem es den kontrolleuren den r cken st rkt zum anderen hat es aber auch die hohe verantwortung der netzbetreiber f r die versorgungssicherheit in deutschland anerkannt indem kleinere korrekturen zugunsten von investitionen zugelassen worden sind das ist wichtig denn wir brauchen den ausbau der netze um mehr wettbewerb aufnehmen zu k nnen
4398011 noch immer mangelt es auf dem strommarkt an wettbewerb eine trennung zwischen netz und produktion k nnte ihn endlich in schwung bringen weil so kleinere versorger besseren zugang zum netz erhielten an einer trennung f hrt kein weg vorbei unter politischem druck hatte eon als erster konzern bereits angedeutet seine stromleitungen wom glich abgeben zu wollen das gestrige bgh urteil k nnte diesen prozess beschleunigen weil es die netze unattraktiver macht damit w re viel erreicht so k nnte das urteil noch viel mehr wert sein als 100 mio euro
4398012 das urteil ist ein wichtiges signal der staat geht erfolgreich gegen missbrauch vor allerdings darf das nicht dar ber hinwegt uschen dass die politik es bisher nicht wirklich verstanden hat die marktmacht der platzhirsche so wirksam zu beschr nken dass auch neue player eine chance haben nur das w rde den wettbewerb anheizen und damit die prognostizierte weitere verteuerung etwas d mpfen entlastung des geldbeutels bringt daher nur eines zu g nstigeren anbietern wechseln und strom sparen wo immer es geht die n chste preisrunde kommt n mlich bestimmt

4398021 we dont want to get rid of foreign aid we want to reform it so it is in line with the palestinians priorities
4398022 you have to know how to use each system to file evaluations and grant applications and it has to be done in english for the most part
4398023 palestinian civil society organizations can also help each other by partnering among themselves
4398024 we need to keep our eye on the ball and not lose sight of the fact that assistance is supposed to be effective for beneficiaries
4398025 by locally empowering we reduce the need for foreign assistance

4398035 se sabe que estamos hablando de una consulta no vinculante
4398036 el tema de la paz la necesidad de un escenario sin violencia con el respeto a todos los derechos humanos y a todas las personas

4398056 damit l sst sich die bev lkerung einer stadt wie hamburg mit strom versorgen
4398057 mit blick auf unser gesamtportfolio sind wir f r gut drei jahre ausgebucht
4398058 mit den kernkompetenzen schwei technik plus robotik hat sich cloos sehr gut positioniert und als zuverl ssiger systempartner erwiesen
4398059 die etwa 340 m kehl und v n hte haben wir fr her per hand verschwei t was unseren mitarbeitern k rperlich einiges abverlangt hat
4398060 nach zehn geschwei ten auskleidungen f r die turbinenlagergeh use wissen wir dass wir die richtige entscheidung f r die cloos technik getroffen haben
4398061 anhand unserer cad bauteildaten hat cloos parallel zur entwicklung und fertigung der roboteranlage in haiger bereits die lage und beschaffenheit der schwei n hte f r die programmierung der steuerung simuliert
4398062 roboter und positionierer sind so gelenkig dass nur noch etwa 20 der arbeit von hand erledigt werden m ssen
4398063 und ein lichtbogensensor sorgt f r die nahtverfolgung und steuert den schwei kopf so dass wir keinen erh hten aufwand f r die nahtvorbereitung und spaltbreiten treiben m ssen
4398064 daran konnten wir den umgang mit dem roboter trainieren und die optimalen parameter finden
4398065 wir zeigen sehr eindr cklich dass der standort deutschland sehr wohl international konkurrenzf hig ist weil wir auf leistungsstarke fertigungstechnik kernkompetenzen und hochmotivierte mitarbeiter setzen und in sachen schwei technik leistet cloos einen entscheidenden anteil an diesem erfolg

4398109 italia satu tim yang sangat kuat tim berkelas dunia kami memiliki kesempatan untuk membuat sejarah dalam persepakbolaan belgia dan aku yakin kami akan memiliki tenaga ganda dan kemenangan luar biasa jika hal itu terjadi kami hanya berharap bisa tetap berada di turnamen dan menambah cerita manis ini
4398110 kami tak boleh memandang remeh belanda sebuah tim dengan kualitas individu luar biasa dan permainan sepakbola kelas tinggi kami adalah tim argentina dan kami di sini untuk mengejar medali emas tapi kami tetap menghormati semua lawan yang bakal menghadang di setiap langkah kami itu sebuah formula
4398111 ini kondisi sangat bagus bagi afrika saat ada tiga tim yang lolos ke perempatfinal ini artinya kami berada di posisi kompetitif kala berlaga di turnamen besar nigeria adalah juara delapan tahun lalu tapi tim kami jelas memiliki kapabilitas tinggi untuk melaju ke final aku banyak mengambil semangat di tim ini

4398114 dont push me ill pull you instead and if you push too hard ill pull away
4398115 from the outset the hubs were keen to work together to aggregate their volumes and to apply their joint buying power in the marketplace
4398116 buying solutions provided the facilitation and project management for the procurement as well as advice and guidance but without doubt the hard work was done by the hubs themselves this has laid the foundations for future collaborative work between the nhs ogcbuying solutions and the wider public sector
4398117 collaboration is nothing new to the cphs however a collaboration exercise of this scale consisting of a team of individuals from six different regional organisations representing 220 nhs trusts was a significant challenge we all recognised
4398118 we hope this will set the pattern for future projects together with my counterparts in other regions we hope to identify other areas from which a collaborative approach will bring greater benefits to our respective member trusts
4398119 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4398120 i appeal to all elements to adopt an approach of reconciliation so that there is political stability and we can firmly confront the real problems facing the country
4398121 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4398122 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4398123 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4398124 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
4398125 deploying a united states strategic asset that protects the national security of the united states in the country of poland further enhances the security and sovereignty of poland
4398126 events like this are important if we want to educate the wider community
4398127 it was informal and informative and thats what people want
4398128 even muslims came to find out more about their own religion
4398129 we started collecting samples a week or so before industry started being shut down to reduce pollution and prior to vehicular restrictions
4398130 we will collect through the olympics and during the power up of industry and increase in vehicular traffic
4398131 we have no data for the study yet but it will be interesting to see what gas concentrations are reduced by the restrictions we wont get the samples back until september so we wont have results until a month or so after that meinardi is handling the gas sampling while tao wang a collaborator from hong kong studies particulate
4398132 we have performed very well in recent friendlies they have been great attacking performances so it is not something that concerns me
4398133 we are aware there are only two weeks to go before the end of the window that is something we are working on constantly anyway
4398134 we work without rest to look for players and weve always known the deadline day is the august 31
4398135 we are working calming in the background on one or two things we prefer to work with as much discretion as we can
4398136 i will wait until the final training session and see how he is in training thats when i will make a decision on that
4398137 hes an excellent pro hes been working totally independently to anything that might be happening outside the football and any speculation has been dealt by his agent

4398143 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
4398144 while the comparisons against us were softer than of late that in no way detracted from the strength of the performance given the extremely challenging trading conditions we are in

4398152 it turns out that mere exposure makes an enormous contribution to how musical competence develops
4398153 we can forget about talks on georgias territorial integrity because its impossible to force south ossetia and abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into georgias fold by force
4398154 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council
4398155 the resolution of kosovos status is covered by a u n security council resolution and that resolution envisions an international process so the two cases are totally different
4398156 this year eight of the top ten finishers from last year are returning and several young golfers whove come through the blue ridge junior golf tour are also in the field
4398157 of course all football is exciting at this time of the year college and high school for this community itself on friday nights everybodys so excited
4398158 football just thrives here its a big program its friday night its the biggest show in town the kids want to be a part of that the schools real supportive of it and the community they just love football
4398159 i think the defense is going to be better than last year
4398160 we have such great fans they support us in any way they can even if they dont have somebody on the team or on the cheerleading squad they help us fund raise
4398161 traditionally weve been very successful that helps so were hoping to bring that back a little bit
4398162 its just been traditionally one of the programs that everybody supports annually well got to away games and well have a lot of times as many people or more than the home crowd our crowd always follow us a lot
4398163 i can tell you quite honestly that we have really been working hard
4398164 our preseason didnt just start we have been working really hard since last year we started about september or october we had a weightlifting program going then
4398165 we as a coaching staff have worked hard too but our kids have really worked hard theyve responded to everything weve asked them to do to this point
4398166 now youve still got the rest of the year to go weve got to start playing ballgames next week but were real proud at this point were where we want to be
4398167 the conditioning looks good attitudes real good the enthusiasms good and i think the potential is there for us to have a successful season
4398168 my firm belief has always been in august youve got to try to build some sort of depth
4398169 no matter how good or bad you are youve got to get people to fill those positions because you cant allow an injury or sickness or whatever may happen to leave you without options if they cant make a play or two
4398170 youve got to have somebody to go in there who wont disrupt the whole scheme of things
4398171 youd better give everybody a look now weve got all morning thats what we do a lot of times just give em different looks try to change schemes in practice every day
4398172 its just good high school football and its in a community where people love football im just appreciative that we have the opportunity to be here as coaches
4398173 weve had a cow thats jumped over a couple gates and smashed them down and has just gotten out a lot of times
4398174 he played hurt a lot during the season especially there at the end
4398175 when i was a freshman and sophomore i learned from a couple backs that have accomplished a lot of things up here
4398176 just their work ethic mainly just staying after it and those are basically the things i got to learn from them
4398177 i knew that i was going to do what i can for the team and i knew we were running short on some people so i thought id probably have to step up and make some big plays for us and id just do what i could
4398178 at the end of the season people were talking maybe first round of the playoffs and we ended up making it to the state championship game for the first time in school history
4398179 getting there was an accomplishment but you always like to win that last game especially bluefield our rival i wish we could have come out on top but im not disappointed with the season we had
4398180 its kind of a competition in the locker room who can have the most tears on their jersey
4398181 that kind of thing keeps everybody working harder and everything
4398182 everyone on the team loves to get out there and get dirty and get down and get their job done
4398183 but the main difference is their coaching styles witt line up and just run the ball more of a power game and coach jackson were going to line up and try to be a little bit quicker than some other teams spread the ball a little bit
4398184 actually i ran most of this offense back in middle school as quarterback so i know a lot of the offense and i feel like we have a lot of skill players to fit into it very well ill be catching passes running throwing a little bit too probably
4398185 i believe weve got some talent on the team this year that we can use in the offense we have now and hopefully things will work out for us
4398186 i dont know if hell get as many touches as he got last year as far as running the ball
4398187 in my system well try to get him in space a little bit more and hopefully keep him healthy keep him from getting banged up so much
4398188 farming cattle youve always have to get your stuff done
4398189 you cant ever take a day off youve always got to be prepared for everything and same thing on the football field you gotta go a hundred percent every practice all through practice and get ready for game day
4398190 i coached his father at peterstown i coached his older brother andrew for one year here
4398191 hes from an athletic family and they can play ball
4398192 hes a fine individual a straight a student tremendous athletic abilities good basketball player and we would like to have them all just like him
4398193 you just work hard every day and hopefully if youre the better team and you always want to win and hopefully give some of the top teams a run for their money
4398194 get in the playoffs again and hopefully make some noise
4398195 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4398196 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4398197 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4398198 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4398199 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4398200 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4398201 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4398202 i think the whole thing is more of symbolic importance
4398203 its establishing a presence showing the flag and challenging the expansion of russian power in that country
4398204 the united states government then will turn to questions of both economic reconstruction and also what to do to help the georgian security forces looking to the longer term future
4398205 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4398206 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4398207 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4398208 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4398209 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4398210 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come

4398216 that last time that i felt this feeling with a team how were coming together how were jelling it was my senior year in high school
4398217 and my senior year in high school we went undefeated
4398218 everybody was making their target times in running everybody was working out every day if we had a workout we asked everybody to be there and everybody showed up giving full effort it was a great summer the best summer since ive been here
4398219 i played three camps at center and practiced at center its not really a move but more of a transformation

4398464 as we mark the 10 th anniversary today of the omagh bombing the worst single atrocity in our troubles may on behalf of the ulster unionist party i express my deepest sympathies to those who lost loved ones to those who were injured and to those who were caught up in that horrific event
4398465 on 15 th august 1998 terrorists murdered innocent children women and men they did not distinguish between age gender nationality or religion and cruelly robbed families of those they loved dearly leaving others with scars which for some will never heal our thoughts and prayers are with those who suffered at the hands of terrorism that fateful day
4398466 tribute must also be paid to those who helped in the immediate aftermath of the atrocity the medical staff at tyrone county hospital and throughout northern ireland the ruc the army the navy and the many local people who helped the injured and the dying their acts of bravery and compassion are a powerful reminder that the last word does not belong to the agents of terror
4398467 for many of those caught up in the omagh bombing the pain and suffering is increased with the knowledge that no one has been brought to justice for the atrocity i would urge the psni and the garda to continue with their investigations those who committed this act of mass murder must be held to account for their evil deeds
4398468 once again northern irelands schools teacher pupils and parents deserve to be congratulated for topping the class in the uks a level results
4398469 this does of course raise yet more serious questions about the sinn fein education ministers ideological crusade against academic selection
4398470 the challenge for the executive and assembly is to address the unacceptable levels of educational underachievement in our society realizing that there is a moral and economic imperative to ensure that every child has the opportunity to excel in school

4398473 the united states is committed to securing a diplomatic resolution with iran on the nuclear issue
4398474 once that is resolved there will be enough opportunities with iran through the oic and others to work on other areas
4398475 we want iran to play a responsible role in the region and it is an important country
4398476 we are looking at only one objective and that is to ensure that there is peace and stability
4398477 everywhere america has engaged and has a presence those societies have opened and they have become more progressive and they are more moderate societies
4398478 we really did a thorough check and are pleased to report that weve confirmed that the female gymnasts are way over 16 theyre just starving to death
4398479 we give them maybe 50 grains of rice per day for most of the year we promised them all full meals for a month if they took home the team gold and boy did that motivate them you can see the results for yourself
4398480 of course the reduced caloric intake plus the incredible amounts of training we forced them through has stunted their growth somewhat but we view height as a bourgeois western value anyway so its kind of a win win

4398495 filipino workers continue to be in strong demand overseas due to the diversity and quality of skills they offer
4398496 the conduct of bilateral talks with host countries also continues to open up new employment opportunities abroad for filipinos
4398497 that is also influencing them so they may choose to send more if they think the dollar will weaken

4398503 if thai troops begin pulling back we will also begin pulling back
4398504 the bears are back in town they are here in full force and doing lots of damage its going to be a pretty ugly friday and monday
4398505 the root causes are many but beyond the macroeconomic triggers the immediate reason for the slide is the dollar
4398506 the rapid weakening of oecd growth outside the us a clear technical break in many dollar crosses and much lower oil prices are powerful signs of improving dollar fundamentals
4398507 the fall in commodities is allowing the market to look beyond the short term inflation shock and towards the weak growth and longer term inflation outlook this is an argument in favor of the dollar and against the euro and sterling as markets move to price in rate cuts
4398508 at the same time following this weeks us cpi and trade data it looks like the second quarter for the us will look strong in terms of growth as well as inflation and that makes the current 2 0 percent fed fund target unrealistically low
4398509 the valuation and growth driven improvements that we have been observing for a while have reached the point where they notably improve the medium to long term outlook for the dollar

4398513 es ist die zeit gekommen unser system der rechts und amtshilfe im bereich der steuern auf eine neue grundlage zu stellen
4398514 wir sollten in zukunft all jenen staaten eine umfassende kooperation anbieten die bereit sind mit uns sinnvolle l sungen f r die gewachsenen kundenbeziehungen zu finden und an einer fairen und konstruktiven zusammenarbeit f r die zukunft interessiert sind
4398515 wir sind kein offshore platz im eigentlichen sinne sondern haben neben dem finanzplatz dessen onshore sektor immer st rker w chst einen bez glich wirtschaftsleistung und besch ftigten deutlich gr sseren und usserst erfolgreichen industriestandort
4398516 wir haben unseren beitrag f r den bisherigen verhandlungserfolg geleistet
4398517 bei einer verst rkten zusammenarbeit in steuerfragen k nnen diese chancen insbesondere im angebot von onshore dienstleistungen liegen gemeinn tzigen stiftungen versicherungen investmentfonds und pensionsfonds wird in den kommenden jahren ein grosses wachstum vorhergesagt und sie k nnen leichter vertrieben werden wenn sich liechtenstein auf das europ ische niveau im bereich der kooperation in steuerfragen begibt
4398518 denn w hrend viele staaten den gl sernen b rger einf hren pflegen wir eine kultur der privatsph re die weit ber das bankkundengeheimnis in steuerfragen hinausgeht
4398519 unser staat ist f r die b rger da und nicht die b rger f r unseren staat
4398520 the time has come for us to base our system of mutual legal assistance and administrative assistance in tax matters on a new foundation
4398521 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive cooperation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive cooperation for the future
4398522 we are not an offshore center as such but rather have in addition to the increasingly strong onshore sector of the financial center an extremely successful industrial sector which in terms of economic output and jobs is considerably larger than the financial sector
4398523 we have made our contribution to the success of the negotiations so far
4398524 with stronger cooperation in tax matters these opportunities may lie especially in onshore service offerings charitable foundations insurance companies investment funds and pension funds are expected to grow substantially in the coming years and they can be marketed more easily if liechtenstein adopts the european standard with respect to cooperation in tax matters
4398525 while many states are introducing the transparent citizen we practice a culture of privacy that goes far beyond bank client secrecy in tax matters
4398526 our state is here for its citizens not the other way around
4398527 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4398528 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4398529 although personnel counts are rough approximations cbo estimates that as of early 2008 at least 190 000 contractor personnel including subcontractors were working on us funded contracts in the iraq theater

4398535 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4398536 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4398537 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4398538 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4398539 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4398540 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4398541 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4398542 we feel that the arabs and jews are cousins in race having suffered similar oppressions at the hands of powers stronger than themselves and by a happy coincidence have been able to take the first step towards the attainment of their national ideals together the arabs especially the educated among us look with the deepest sympathy on the zionist movement
4398543 israelis give us jobs and an opportunity to live in peace what kind of future awaits us under plo
4398544 we are with you but are afraid to tell it
4398545 peace is possible between ishmael and israel according to the quran and the tanach bible
4398546 interfaith dialogue must be understood as a part of the missionary activity of the catholic church
4398547 all german boys at that time were forced to become members of the hitler youth
4398548 you are our ally in the war against fascism in europe
4398549 we paid for your election and now you must do want we want from you
4398550 jews for the only reason of their being jews must be deported from new york and forcibly resettled in new jersey
4398551 concerning music and dancing as aids to the religious life
4398552 the heart of man has been so constituted by the almighty that like a flint it contains a hidden fire which is evoked by music and harmony and renders man beside himself with ecstasy these harmonies are echoes of that higher world of beauty which we call the world of spirits they remind man of his relationship to that world and produce in him an emotion so deep and strange that he himself is powerless to explain it the effect of music and dancing is deeper in proportion as the natures on which they act are simple and prone to motion they fan into a flame whatever love is already dormant in the heart whether it be earthly and sensual or divine and spiritual
4398553 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4398554 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4398555 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4398556 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4398557 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4398558 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4398559 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4398560 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4398561 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4398562 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4398563 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4398564 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4398565 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4398566 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4398567 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4398568 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4398569 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4398570 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4398571 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4398572 these people are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4398573 the tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4398574 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the ltte has also engaged in forced recruitment
4398575 both sides to this long conflict have again shown that they will jeopardise the lives of thousands of ordinary people in the pursuit of military objectives
4398576 in the absence of independent international monitors sri lankan civilians lack protection and remain at the mercy of two forces with long records of abuse
4398577 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4398578 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4398579 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4398580 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4398581 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4398582 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4398583 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4398584 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4398585 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4398586 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4398587 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4398588 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4398589 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4398590 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4398591 low growns continued to weaken for the third consecutive week while the high and mid grown small leaf varieties held firm
4398592 most low grown varieties in both leafy catalogues and small leaf catalogues were discounted substantially
4398593 teas in the best category were firm on last weeks levels whilst the secondary sorts were discounted heavily and often remained unsold due to lack of bids received
4398594 in the leafy grade segment the market took a dip this week too
4398595 the fasting period around the corner and congestion in ports in middle east countries paved the way to a drop in price
4398596 the quality buyers such as japan uk europe and russia were quite strong in the market picking up whatever that was brighter due to the fear of the irregular weather which would hamper quality
4398597 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4398598 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4398599 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4398600 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4398601 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4398602 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4398603 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4398604 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4398605 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4398606 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4398607 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4398608 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4398609 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4398610 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4398611 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4398612 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4398613 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4398614 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4398615 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4398616 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4398617 we hope our installations will bring about a net cooling of the area

4398627 the longer we resolve this case the more tension and uncertainty it will bring which will do no one any good
4398628 as the highest office in the land the presidents foremost thrust should be uniting the people and this controversial pact has already brought too much division and it will continue to do so if government will insist on this highly questionable moa
4398629 it is possible that there are syndicates run by indians here or elsewhere in the philippines but we still have to confirm where their base of operations are or if they really exist
4398630 we need more time to investigate and we need more proofs linking the crimes to the so called indian mafia
4398631 we will dig deeper into these kind of crimes if the kaur case will be solved im sure there will be a domino effect other crimes of the same nature involving indians will also be solved
4398632 how the oil firms determine pricing and the amount of rollback remains a mystery
4398633 oil firms have been allowed to further achieve monopoly control over the industry because of deregulation which makes urgent the need for government regulation and control over the local oil sector to help ensure transparency in pricing
4398634 i was struck by the high quality of professionalism and volunteer service of the people i have worked with over the years
4398635 we feel like we will get a lot of business taken care of and hopefully he will be able to wear more than just an attorney hat we intend to get him active in economic development and we intend to have a more aggressive collection on the collection route
4398636 most household workers who would rather leave illegally just to avoid this new restrictive requirement
4398637 thousands of household workers have left as undocumented workers and hundreds of them continue to leave daily sneak out of the country because they refuse to subject themselves to the requirement imposed two years ago and here comes this psychiatric test

4398644 the carnivorous dinosaurs are looking at the younger herbivorous dinosaurs
4398645 they are actually hunting the younger ones once the hypacrosaurus reaches that adult size we think its safer from predation its a size refuge
4398646 and it got even more frightening when you saw the others
4398647 theres a lot of comment being made that it looks fake or it looks like a suit
4398648 but these people wasnt there when i was sweating pulling this thing through the woods
4398649 its been like this as far as i can remember we build houses then fighting occurs we leave and return home and build our houses again
4398650 being alive after all the troubles just makes me thankful despite the difficulties
4398651 mmhmm it looks great on me you should see it
4398652 the outfits f fine b but y you should g get o off me
4398653 if im so fine can you get off my fineness then
4398654 you should stop thinking that everything goes in your favor reina
4398655 they are a very compact team several players will be called
4398656 the team deserved more it played fantastic football all that was missing was good results
4398657 i never thought that austria would play such great football against croatia and poland this is an honest compliment i dont need to make anything up
4398658 it wont be an easy game for us i will demand that my players be absolutely focused
4398659 i do not know anything about it not from my agent nor from the club
4398660 they say rangers have not had much money until now
4398661 but i find that hard to understand because they get 50 000 people every other week and its a very big club
4398662 we are being obliged to contemplate transfers of 6m 8m that type of figure so it seems strange a club of that stature can only afford what they have offered us
4398663 i am perfectly happy to keep steven he is a good player and i would be very disappointed if the club allowed him to go for a sum of money that is below his worth
4398664 companies need to communicate why theyre making cuts with all employees especially those remaining and outplacement helps instil confidence in the future in both sides
4398665 long term the worst thing a company can do is start taking out hr jobs because of the recession
4398666 the message it sends to the business at large if they move hr is that the business is not interested in its people
4398667 im bringing in more business partners to give the business more of what it wants
4398668 if a company director has a team meeting a business partner needs to be there to voice people issues

4398670 places like truro have very little support so what we have here is wonderful
4398671 you dont know a lot about diabetes or cancer if you havent been touched by it
4398672 theres definitely more people living with hiv and aids than you ever could imagine but you dont always realize who is touched by it its similar to mental illness in a way its still a silent disease and a struggle for the people with it
4398673 its one thing to help people with aids in africa and its a wonderful thing but there are also people living with hiv and aids right here
4398674 we have pledge sheets and yes money is important but people coming out and walking is even more important
4398675 being involved in many community activities i see the challenges facing us in district 1 but envision solutions
4398676 i plan to continue recruiting volunteers for the merigomish and area and the barneys river fire departments
4398677 i attended all strategic planning sessions for district 1 facilitated by the pictou regional development commission
4398678 i probably hit 18 greens and i dont remember chipping so that was good too
4398679 it was a great day it always feels good when you have no bogeys on your scorecard youve got to be careful off the tee to hit the fairways thats going to be the key all week
4398680 i got off to a great start and made tons of putts i missed a few opportunities on the second nine but i made a birdie to finish on a high note so im very pleased
4398681 i cant remember the last time i had 10 putts on nine holes
4398682 i think my game has always been there its more emotionally sometimes you have ups and downs and distractions and youre tired
4398683 ive played solid the last couple of weeks ive had my rest and my time to practice and get motivated i dont want to get too far ahead this is just one round hopefully it will continue to go in this direction
4398684 on ne peut pas encourager ceux qui ont envie de mourir

4398690 its the first time he ever experienced anything to that magnitude
4398691 he was very upset and he was angry of course my son had never met this man he was targeted because of the colour of his skin
4398692 as a mother of aboriginal children you know that discrimination is still alive and well even here in pictou county
4398693 it was in dartmouth as well but this time were not going to run from it
4398694 im trying to teach my kids that they dont have to accept this
4398695 they love their culture and their heritage and they shouldnt have to feel ashamed about it
4398696 you get calls you hear of people who have experienced racism and you say oh my god its still happening
4398697 when i hear of an incident of racism it deeply deeply saddens me having experienced racism it really saddens me because i know how much it hurts and how prolonged the effect it has on you its something you never forget i just shiver when i hear it
4398698 when i started i never imagined id still be doing this id rather say that racism had been eradicated than looking at the 20th anniversary of the run it saddens me concerns me and deeply troubles me that its still happening in 2008
4398699 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4398700 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4398701 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4398702 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4398703 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4398704 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4398705 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw
4398706 he was the most kind soft spoken man very polite
4398707 he made his bed put his clothes on a hanger he was a career military man spit and polish to the end
4398708 it does concern me that not only in missouri but apparently other states this is the person they turn to
4398709 it does illustrate how difficult it is to find doctors willing to do this
4398710 i assure them ive taken care of everything so that nothing will go wrong i help them calmly go through the procedure
4398711 it will have the same effect the guy will die
4398712 i think the whole thing is more of symbolic importance
4398713 its establishing a presence showing the flag and challenging the expansion of russian power in that country
4398714 the united states government then will turn to questions of both economic reconstruction and also what to do to help the georgian security forces looking to the longer term future
4398715 to punish georgia for daring to try to integrate with the west economically and politically and in security arrangements
4398716 i think that the russians further message was to all of the parts of the former soviet union as a signal about trying to integrate with the west and move outside of the longtime russian sphere of influence
4398717 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4398718 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
4398719 re examine the entire gamut of our military to military activities and will make changes as necessary and appropriate depending on russian actions in the days ahead
4398720 if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come

4398737 fmit has admitted it made an improper investment from funds that were borrowed from the state government for upgrades to irrigation systems but were instead invested in the us subprime mortgage market

4398770 saya tidak yakin dengan asumsi pemerintah yang mematok inflasi pada kisaran 6 5 persen karena tingkat suku bunga di dalam negeri juga masih cenderung tinggi
4398771 hampir dipastikan hingga pertengahan 2009 fed fund bank sentral as menaikkan bunga saat seperti itu tingat bunga di dalam negeri seharusnya diturunkan bukan justru naik untuk meredam inflasi
4398772 kenaikan bi rate cenderung tergesa gesa sehingga pada posisi yang tinggi saat ini sulit untuk diturunkan secara drastis ini mengakibatkan dampaknya terhadap inflasi masih akan besar

4398893 bei einer verst rkten zusammenarbeit in steuerfragen k nnen diese chancen insbesondere im angebot von onshore dienstleistungen liegen gemeinn tzigen stiftungen versicherungen investmentfonds und pensionsfonds wird in den kommenden jahren ein grosses wachstum vorhergesagt und sie k nnen leichter vertrieben werden wenn sich liechtenstein auf das europ ische niveau im bereich der kooperation in steuerfragen begibt
4398894 denn w hrend viele staaten den gl sernen b rger einf hren pflegen wir eine kultur der privatsph re die weit ber das bankkundengeheimnis in steuerfragen hinausgeht
4398895 unser staat ist f r die b rger da und nicht die b rger f r unseren staat
4398896 the time has come for us to base our system of mutual legal assistance and administrative assistance in tax matters on a new foundation
4398897 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive cooperation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive cooperation for the future
4398898 we are not an offshore center as such but rather have in addition to the increasingly strong onshore sector of the financial center an extremely successful industrial sector which in terms of economic output and jobs is considerably larger than the financial sector
4398899 we have made our contribution to the success of the negotiations so far
4398900 with stronger cooperation in tax matters these opportunities may lie especially in onshore service offerings charitable foundations insurance companies investment funds and pension funds are expected to grow substantially in the coming years and they can be marketed more easily if liechtenstein adopts the european standard with respect to cooperation in tax matters
4398901 while many states are introducing the transparent citizen we practice a culture of privacy that goes far beyond bank client secrecy in tax matters
4398902 our state is here for its citizens not the other way around
4398903 transcend ist nicht mehr nur spezialist f r speichermedien sondern legt den fokus zunehmend auf unterhaltungselektronik genau deshalb ist die ifa f r uns eine gute gelegenheit unsere st rke auch in diesem bereich zu demonstrieren
4398904 damit wird erneut und zum vierten mal festgestellt dass es zu keinem zeitpunkt eingriffe in den von der physikalisch technischen bundesanstalt ptb genehmigten spiel und gewinnplan von unterhaltungsspielger ten mit gewinnm glichkeit zum vor und oder nachteil von spielg sten gegeben hat diese klare feststellung erf llt mich als unternehmer auch im interesse meiner familie und allen meinen mitarbeiterinnen und mitarbeitern mit gro er zufriedenheit wir sind in den vergangenen jahren f nf mal von den in unserem wirtschaftszweig bekannten und gescheiterten existenzen mit in etwa immer gleichen oder hnlichen dubiosen verd chtigungen angezeigt und jedes mal in einem bekannten hamburger nachrichtenmagazin verunglimpft worden f r mich hat die erneute verfahrenseinstellung gezeigt dass die staatsanwalt gr ndlich und umfassend ermittelt und denunzianten nicht auf den leim geht
4398905 bei der vorgenommenen sachbehandlung einstellung gem 153 a stpo wurde insbesondere beachtet dass die festgestellten abweichungen zu den pr frichtlinien der ptb nach der am 01 01 2006 geltenden neuen spielverordnung kein versto gegen gesetzliche normen darstellt
4398906 ich hoffe dass diese wirtschaftlich gescheiterten au enseiter und neider nun endlich verstanden haben dass ihre verleumderischen unterstellungen zwar viel staub aufgewirbelt aber zu keinem zeitpunkt der wahrheit entsprochen haben
4398907 ich bedauere es sehr dass sich jedes mal ein bundesweit bekanntes nachrichtenmagazin vor den karren dieser denunzianten hat spannen lassen
4398908 wir allerdings haben im unterschied dazu zu keinem zeitpunkt unsere glaubw rdigkeit verspielt
4398909 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
4398910 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
4398911 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness

4398942 suddenly we had flash cars images egos and everyone knew who we were and when we didnt freshen things up with new players we were in a dangerous situation
4398943 there was a real lord of the flies split which i had never experienced before we didnt feel we were all together and i was partly to blame
4398944 what gets opened up to view in these disturbing sometimes spectacular collisions is not just the statistical importance and multiple meanings of four wheeled trauma for our culture today but our insistent curiosity fascination and horror the shock or thrill of recognition empathy or sadism or just the ubiquitous idling will to gawk that draws us alternately to the crash scene and these pages

4398947 it does concern me that not only in missouri but apparently other states this is the person they turn to

4399010 i had a few odd jobs although my main focus was on going to the gym every day and keeping my fitness levels up so that id be ready if the chance came to go into full time football
4399011 working at drayton manor was one of the most enjoyable jobs i did
4399012 i worked on the games throwing things through hoops the coconut shy and all sorts of other things like that
4399013 i had to explain how the games worked to people take their money and let them have a go
4399014 then i had to try to keep them coming back even though it was obvious they wouldnt win
4399015 it wasnt impossible to win every game had a trick to it and we knew them all
4399016 i can still do a few of them now and its fair to say weve got a few teddies about the place at home
4399017 whether its looking around at the other players in the wales squad or coming up against clubs like charlton in the championship it can feel a bit strange
4399018 but i never gave up hope of playing at this level even when i was at hednesford
4399019 obviously it all seemed pretty far away at the time and i couldnt really see how i was going to get there
4399020 but i knew if i kept working hard it might happen and fortunately for me it did
4399021 he has not been involved in the squads ive been in but were due to meet up with wales on sunday so ill have a chat with him then
4399022 hopefully well have just beaten forest and ill have the bragging rights
4399023 i dont know robert earnshaw but ive watched him for years and i know hes a brilliant player
4399024 hes very sharp and has an eye for goal hes a predator a bit like kevin phillips
4399025 i know that if im playing tomorrow im going to have to be on top of my game to handle him
4399026 i think half of the strikers well come up against this season could play in the premier league and every week is going to be a massive challenge
4399027 the key is going to be stopping them getting chances because if they get them they will put them away
4399028 we lost the game on them last week but i dont think theres a crisis or anything like that
4399029 weve looked at it and spoken about it as a team and were ready to put things right
4399030 were not the biggest team physically and we know there are going to be bigger sides than us
4399031 but if we can stand up and do our jobs at set pieces wed like to think that we can use the fact that we are a bit more mobile to our advantage in other parts of the game
4399032 if i was to point to something and say this could be stressful for me right now it would not be whether i get into the fedex cup
4399033 it would be you know am i going to be able to finish this year in the top 125
4399034 am i going to be able to finish in the top 150
4399035 i said i imagine yall are here to watch drew right
4399036 they kind of laughed and felt bad that they werent there to watch me i relayed to them that one of my career goals was to get where im good enough where someone might actually go to a golf course pick up a pairing sheet and say ill follow bob heintzs group today
4399037 thats kind of a vague career goal but they started to tease me about that as the day went on i guess ill follow you now id rather have attention than you know have nobody know who i was
4399038 this golf course actually sets up better for me than forest oaks did
4399039 this is more of a placement off the tee kind of golf course and hitting the greens and making some putts forest oaks was more of a shootout see how many birdies you can make if you hit it long you had an advantage over here you dont youve got to place it around the golf course which is kind of more suited to my game
4399040 maar zet mensen niet alleen aan het denken maar ook aan het doen

4399080 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4399081 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4399082 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4399083 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4399084 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4399090 one concern i have is that this hypothesis has been accepted almost without debate by so many people
4399091 and then some are excluded because theyre not considered severe septic shock
4399092 there were absolutely no patients pulled out before the analysis
4399093 all patients enrolled in the early goal directed therapy study were appropriately selected randomized and examined statistically
4399094 demonstrated that early goal directed therapy yields significant reductions in sepsis related mortality lower organ failure rates and or reduced health care costs particularly due to reduced stays
4399095 routinely given to advance science and treatments for the benefit of patients
4399096 a lot of the experts are turned to by industry for consulting
4399097 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4399098 i would like to take this opportunity to apologise to him his friends and family for any distortion of public opinion or distress that my comments may have had and i hope this letter serves to go some way to correct that
4399099 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
4399100 torchwood has really reached out to audiences worldwide and the fact its moved up the channels on the bbc is incredible

4399106 you know that nowadays even women of our age can become pregnant
4399107 either they are pregnant or they are extremely emotional were you very emotional before it happened
4399108 maybe you received a proposal of marriage and fainted from excitement ah

4399131 this is the most publicized issue theyve had in their history and its really the sort of an embarrassing bug that never should have made it past qa quality assurance
4399132 last night we became aware of a code issue with the recently released update to esx 3 5 and esxi 3 5 update 2
4399133 from what ive heard the patch fixes the problem you do have to give kudos to vmware for addressing the issue so quickly
4399134 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
4399135 a small percentage does not diminish the severity of problem for affected users and the upmost urgency is expected from a company that caters to enterprise customers who dont have downtime in their corporate dictionary anymore
4399136 however i believe this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with microsofts hyper v this will no doubt teach vmware a lesson and unfortunately will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise its a shame a clearly superior product is going to get bad publicity from this oversight lets give them credit and hope they learn from their mistakes
4399137 the issue was fixed quickly and there was lots of communication as to the status cause and future changes to prevent another incident
4399138 however some faith has been lost as most customers ive talked to are disappointed that a bug like this made it past qa many admins have been pushing virtualization to their executives and this doesnt help their case
4399139 virtualization is still in the emerging stages and enterprise reliability is a huge issue that can only be proven over time
4399140 vendors have been pushing the idea that it is enterprise ready and an incident like this hurts not only vmware but the entire virtualization movement virtualization is inevitable and will certainly continue to proceed but people will slow down and think more about how to protect themselves against things like this

4399172 ets europe has apologised to schools for the delays in marking national curriculum assessments in england as a subsidiary of a global non profit company we are dedicated to assuring quality and equity for all pupils and we are sorry that the results this summer were delayed for some schools
4399173 however we would argue that the quality of the marking is high due to the stringent new checks that we introduced this year

4399295 abuse in gay male relationships primarily involves apolitical gay men or gay men who are part of the bar culture
4399296 abuse in gay male relationships is sexual behavior its a version of sadomasochism and the victims actually like it

4399321 if it is to make a serious move into producing mid to high end handsets it needs to convince operators that it has the expertise and reliability to produce high end devices it must also re educate operators and consumers on its brand and reputation
4399322 to target high end segments zte must enhance its brand image through effective marketing
4399323 to compete in the more lucrative handset segments it must not only imitate but also innovate this is one area that differentiates the top five handset vendors from their competitors
4399324 zte has a rigorous handset development process its local teams provide a valuable channel to facilitate communication between the client and ztes r amp d teams
4399325 it was only after beginning to receive supplies from hon hai that we no longer worried that supply would fall short of demand
4399326 in the end hon hai acquires its technologies even if it is difficult once it determines that the technology will allow the company to lower costs farther than other companies and still generate a profit it can do this because it learns technologies like its life depended on it
4399327 i can finally focus my ability on the themes that i have always wanted to tackle since the time i worked for a japanese company
4399328 as the size of related businesses is large at hon hai we can leverage advantages of scale some may blame me for letting technologies out of japan but i cant make what i want to make without a sufficient production volume
4399329 after successfully establishing a business at hon hai i would like to contribute to japanese industry by facilitating collaboration between japanese companies and hon hai
4399330 the myth that japan is the best in manufacturing has already collapsed
4399331 si no hay acuerdo ahora habr tal mayor a en catalu a favorable a un paso m s

4399335 de momento ni podemos sobrevivir ni cohabitar porque el asedio al que se nos somete es insostenible
4399336 el estatut debe darnos soluciones para ahora pero el pr ximo paso debe ser el concierto
4399337 estamos viviendo un cambio de modelo y los partidos catalanes debemos volver a forjar un consenso similar al de antes de 1977
4399338 se est n generando las condiciones para construir este nuevo consenso pero evidentemente no ser f cil

4399340 hay que tener mucha cara para decir que ha habido incumplimiento por la parte catalana

4399346 mengapa anda marah jika anda marah karena perasaan keadilan terluka apakah perasaan keadilan itu perasaan keadilan itu kan tidak dapat dikuantifikasi jadi jika anda marah atas dasar terlukanya perasaan keadilan bagaimana hal itu dapat ditakar dalam bahasa hukum positif kejengkelan kekecewaan dan kemarahan jika ditempatkan dalam tataran hukum positif itu berarti anda menderita kerugian karena tindakan ketidakadilan tertentu tetapi apakah ketika perasaan keadilan anda terusik apakah itu berarti anda dengan sendirinya menderita kerugian bagaimana hal ini dapat ditakar bukankah semuanya ini bersifat subjektif belaka

4399365 when you come into something biased for one side or the other

4399378 the central bank has effectively opened the door for an interest rate cut possibly as soon as next month

4399381 we have a new guitar player thats gonna play for the first time tomorrow its the first time well play on stage together his name is wes borland and he used to be in a really terrible band that he left because he felt that it was a destructive force in art

4399383 he just needs a week in with the group doing all the things he needs to do and were not going into that with him now so i think its very very doubtful
4399384 it seems people are finding that a more prudent approach to managing their finances brings greater rewards and satisfaction than the days of cheap credit

4399398 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4399399 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
4399400 thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4399401 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula 1 can be and thats one of the reasons why its such a fascinating sport
4399402 clearly though i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim
4399403 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
4399404 we launched the vodafone mclaren mercedes team in the city at the start of 2007 and ive tested at the ricardo tormo circuit so the city isnt unfamiliar to me
4399405 anyway going to a new circuit doesnt really change my preparations everybodys in the same situation so i dont treat things very differently

4399410 i am satisfied that the history given by jatinder to the ambulance officers and to doctors of the consumption of 16 panadol tablets was not true
4399411 i also accept expert evidence that the amount consumed must have been well in excess of that disclosed
4399412 my wife was very friendly a good lady i still miss her
4399413 in reality this project has no relation to the iranian missile threat but is aimed against russia
4399414 this is an important agreement for the security of the united states for the security of poland and the security of our nato allies
4399415 ok so were going to have a thing here and that there and then over here well keep things the same this is this this is this and this is this

4399418 for the first time in my life i was amazed by the mastery with which putin is able to hold onto power
4399419 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located we wont allow the deaths of our compatriots go unpunished
4399420 in any case i think this too is an indirect indication of who is more important in this ruling tandem
4399421 you see thugs differ from normal people in that when they smell blood its hard for them to stop
4399422 otherwise people would begin to call into question his ability to run the country and accuse him of being spineless
4399423 the political process can always be looked at either through a telescope or a microscope
4399424 if you look up close of course much is changing but if you take the longer view it turns out that the system was totalitarian and continues to be totalitarian
4399425 thou shalt go wherever the chaiman of cricket australia decrees
4399426 the marketing people for these companies are smart and they go after the top athletes the gold medalists
4399427 so someone who is finishing lower in the rankings if they see the gold medalist wearing this new suit they are going to want to try it out as well
4399428 they looked at fish and sharks and tried to recreate a surface that is similar to what they would have on their skin
4399429 its similar to the non stick frying pans you use to cook your eggs if you have a smooth surface then instead of water sticking to the suit which would cause friction it slides along it with less friction the athlete then is able to move faster
4399430 although it is hoped that the uk military presence in iraq will decrease significantly in the future it is still too early to discuss the size and shape of a reduced uk forces footprint as a key coalition partner the us is intimately involved with the development of our future plans
4399431 er waren veel dopinggevallen voor de olympische spelen dus zullen er misschien daarom minder zijn tijdens we hebben al drie gevallen na een competitieweek dus logisch redenerend kunnen we er dan zes verwachten of in ieder geval toch minder dan tien maar dat is natuurlijk ook maar speculatie
4399432 het is ook het resultaat van de bewustwording van de atleten ze beseffen meer en meer dat men niet meedoet aan de olympische spelen als men gedopeerd is
4399433 ra l moet nog niet wanhopen de deur is nog niet definitief gesloten
4399434 het probleem is dat we erg veel goede spitsen hebben er zitten nog spelers guti nvdr in hetzelfde schuitje als ra l
4399435 i was sure that i would feature in upcoming crucial games after overcoming the injury worries before our first match
4399436 then it was like hell for me because when i tried to sprint i felt a sharp pain in my kneecap
4399437 but i have been getting quality treatment to give myself the best chance at the games its a lot better than when i first did it and i can jog now so hopefully i will not feel it again
4399438 in terms of the national environmental management act nema 2006 regulations a total of 6 423 applications were received by environmental authorities since coming into effect in july 2006 at the end of march 2008 3 399 of those were pending authorities report that at least 70 of all eia applications are processed within the prescribed timeframes
4399439 i contin uously receive reports from provincial departments indicating high levels of staff turnover and a lack of financial resources to develop the decision support tools required to improve their eia efficiency and effectiveness
4399440 in some instances the eaps undertook work beyond the required scope and submitted general reports which contradicted specialist reports
4399441 the eia system was overloaded by a large number of applications for activities that had insignificant environmental impacts in other words too many activities were subjected to the process
4399442 to date r13 million has been spent in this regard and a further r2 million is committed to finalise contractual commitments in three provinces
4399443 about 300 of these are still within reasonable timeframes and the true backlog accordingly is in the order of 270 applications
4399444 deat has also implemented a monitoring system where provinces and deat report on a quarterly basis on the number of applications received and finalised these reports also include information on human resource capacity
4399445 recent reports indicated an alarming rate of staff turnover and an increase in the number of applications received while the number of applications finalised in the same period has not increased deat is accordingly concerned that a new backlog may be forming
4399446 amendments are currently being effected to both nema and the 2006 eia regulations these amendments are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the eia system and to diversify the environ mental impact management toolkit beyond eias only it is our estimation that the amendment bill should be enacted towards the end of the year followed by the amendment to the 2006 regulations
4399447 deat gauteng the western cape and mpumalanga have also embarked on the identification and publication of sensitive areas this work has however been delayed as a result of the current law reform which is in progress
4399448 the increase in the number of applications as a result of the electricity response plan has resulted in a temporary overload on our existing capacity and some projects have been slightly delayed as a result of this but this has now been corrected
4399449 this work together with the information emanating from the eia efficiency and effectiveness study will be used to inform future interventions inform province specific capacity and support strategies and inform generic capacity and support initiatives
4399450 an application for authorisation is triggered if the activity to be undertaken is identified as an activity requiring an environmental authorisation in terms of nema these activities are detailed in two schedules to the 2006 eia regulations the first schedule contains activities for which a basic assessment process must be undertaken before an environ mental authorisation may be issued and the second schedule identifies activities for which a scoping and eia process is required the nature extent and location of the activities determine whether they are placed in schedule one or two
4399451 the bulk of the time associated with the eia however is associated with undertaking the necessary studies investigations and public consultation process there is no prescription and understandably so as information required might for example be influenced by seasonality in terms of the timeframes to compile reports to be submitted to the authority
4399452 it is impossible to average the time required for undertaking the studies and processes and the compilation of these reports

4399464 our customers would have had a hard time getting their heads around the fact that our four engined model was called a330 and our twinjet a340
4399465 the a330 like airbuss second best selling twin aisle family the a300 a310 has prospered due to international route fragmentation a lesson it ignored with the a380 launch decision
4399466 the success since 2004 has been primarily due to the uncertainty surrounding what the a350 would be and when it would be produced
4399467 airbus has been particularly aggressive and successful in marketing the a330 as an interim aircraft to the a350
4399468 more recently the a330 has also benefited from the delays in the 787
4399469 much of the latest round of a330 transactions is related to 787 penalty payments
4399470 i dont think you ever arrive i think anybody who think that theyve arrived or made it anywhere in the media theyre nuts
4399471 tony had been hospitalized for weeks but kept telling me this was a bump in the road although he hesitated to say when he would be back
4399472 im not very anecdotal at age 84 but i am one who remembers quite well being blessed by having him he wrote it the way he thought id want to say it im not glowing rhetorical guy so hed have to downgrade some of his own wonderful way with words barbara loved him and so did i you knew you were gettin the truth
4399473 i dont know can i ask my wife do you have any moments you want to share here with tony they want to talk to you
4399474 i remember his unfalteringly loyalty to the people he worked for and people he knew he didnt have a mean bone in his body and we certainly send our love to jill and the children
4399475 attitude is real important why sit around and bemoan your fate go ahead and get in there and while youre at it enjoy every moment that youre alive
4399476 one of the reasons i took the job is not only because i believe in the president because believe it or not i want to work with you
4399477 he was such a great guy who loved doing the radio show and of course the white house job which he said was the greatest job he ever had tony snow touched millions of people across the country because of his fight against cancer because of his absolute determined optimistic relentless indefatigable fight that spirit touched people that never met him
4399478 people remembered him people sought after him they wanted to tell me their thoughts being around him made you a better person a better thinker a better journalist
4399479 he was a conservative with a difference tony snow was a cheerful conservative he was a professional journalist he was one of us he was a news junkie
4399480 i dont think you can overestimate what a great job he did as the white house press secretary president bush under a lot of heat when tony came in he really set a new model for what a white house press secretary could be his command of the issues his simple good humor and quite frankly his star power he simply changed the whole dynamic of the white house press room because they were playing offense again instead of playing defense and he could just out reason outsmart out talk the reporters and suddenly there was a kind of renaissance for president bush
4399481 laura and i are deeply saddened by the death of our dear friend tony snow
4399482 tony was one of our nations finest writers and commentators
4399483 all of us here at the white house will miss tony as will the millions of americans he inspired with his brave struggle against cancer one of the things that sustained tony snow was his faith and laura and i join people across our country in praying that this good man has now found comfort in the arms of his creator
4399484 tony snow was born in berea ky on june 1 1955 he was raised in cincinnati ohio where his father taught social studies and was an assistant principal at princeton high school his mother was a nurse who died of colon cancer in 1973 when he was 17 years old after graduating from princeton high school in sharonville ohio snow obtained his bachelor of arts in philosophy from davidson college in 1977 he taught physics and geography in kenya and was a substitute teacher in cincinnati teaching everything from calculus to art he also worked as an advocate for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled in north carolina

4399499 we have seen a trend in several of our top hotel markets of more guests at hotels being locals or from nearby areas

4399521 was notified of the bill by u s trade officials
4399522 i think that it is inappropriate for a foreign government to come in and try to influence our democratic legislative process
4399523 when we see that the discussion of trade begins to influence a conversation about public health and environmental protection then we have concerns the bill could have been about health care it could have been about workers benefits it could have been about any number of issues
4399524 the two most important words for sms are urgency and portability

4399621 es ist die zeit gekommen unser system der rechts und amtshilfe im bereich der steuern auf eine neue grundlage zu stellen
4399622 wir sollten in zukunft all jenen staaten eine umfassende kooperation anbieten die bereit sind mit uns sinnvolle l sungen f r die gewachsenen kundenbeziehungen zu finden und an einer fairen und konstruktiven zusammenarbeit f r die zukunft interessiert sind
4399623 wir sind kein offshore platz im eigentlichen sinne sondern haben neben dem finanzplatz dessen onshore sektor immer st rker w chst einen bez glich wirtschaftsleistung und besch ftigten deutlich gr sseren und usserst erfolgreichen industriestandort
4399624 wir haben unseren beitrag f r den bisherigen verhandlungserfolg geleistet
4399625 bei einer verst rkten zusammenarbeit in steuerfragen k nnen diese chancen insbesondere im angebot von onshore dienstleistungen liegen gemeinn tzigen stiftungen versicherungen investmentfonds und pensionsfonds wird in den kommenden jahren ein grosses wachstum vorhergesagt und sie k nnen leichter vertrieben werden wenn sich liechtenstein auf das europ ische niveau im bereich der kooperation in steuerfragen begibt
4399626 denn w hrend viele staaten den gl sernen b rger einf hren pflegen wir eine kultur der privatsph re die weit ber das bankkundengeheimnis in steuerfragen hinausgeht
4399627 unser staat ist f r die b rger da und nicht die b rger f r unseren staat
4399628 the time has come for us to base our system of mutual legal assistance and administrative assistance in tax matters on a new foundation
4399629 in the future we should offer all states comprehensive cooperation if they are willing to find sensible solutions with us for the client relationships we have built up and if they are interested in fair and constructive cooperation for the future
4399630 we are not an offshore center as such but rather have in addition to the increasingly strong onshore sector of the financial center an extremely successful industrial sector which in terms of economic output and jobs is considerably larger than the financial sector
4399631 we have made our contribution to the success of the negotiations so far
4399632 with stronger cooperation in tax matters these opportunities may lie especially in onshore service offerings charitable foundations insurance companies investment funds and pension funds are expected to grow substantially in the coming years and they can be marketed more easily if liechtenstein adopts the european standard with respect to cooperation in tax matters
4399633 while many states are introducing the transparent citizen we practice a culture of privacy that goes far beyond bank client secrecy in tax matters
4399634 our state is here for its citizens not the other way around

4399660 bei der vorgenommenen sachbehandlung einstellung gem 153 a stpo wurde insbesondere beachtet dass die festgestellten abweichungen zu den pr frichtlinien der ptb nach der am 01 01 2006 geltenden neuen spielverordnung kein versto gegen gesetzliche normen darstellt

4399717 that as the body of the dead hypsilophodon individual rotted and collapsed the bones from the skin came to be closely associated with the internal bones

4399719 in the past 20 to 30 years researchers have been able to shrink the size of devices and the size of the patterns that you need to make those devices following the use of the same types of lithographic materials tools and strategies only getting better and better at it
4399720 theres information encoded in the molecules that results in getting certain size and spacing of features with certain desirable properties thermodynamic driving forces make the structures more uniform in size and higher density than you can obtain with the traditional materials
4399721 if you only have to pattern every fourth spot you can write those patterns at a fraction of the time and expense
4399722 this research addresses one of the most significant challenges to delivering patterned media the mass production of patterned disks in high volume at a reasonable cost
4399723 the large potential gains in density offered by patterned media make it one of the most promising new technologies on the horizon for future hard disk drives

4399726 its obviously a male we looked at a very very large primate male it doesnt fit into any of the taxonomic groups i can think of
4399727 unbelievable im still shaking ive never seen anything like this before
4399728 they would certainly have had to belong to a wealthy family of a high status in the community perhaps at fort commander level or at senior level in the roman army
4399729 very few people could have afforded to bury their child in such a grand fashion

4399731 the history of this site has been one of disappointment over deadlines

4399735 i have been away for a few days and this is the first i have seen of them
4399736 people said you came to their door and told them to reject the application that we were dirty migrants and that you had already prepared letters of objections and all they needed were their addresses
4399737 its upsetting to hear un fabricated claims like that against you
4399738 its a serious allegation he made and im sure i would have a very strong case for defamation of character
4399739 the reason i objected to the extended licence was because i feel it may cause anti social behaviour with drunk people getting off buses in the area and visiting the premises
4399740 and the noise will also keep residents especially those with young families up all through the night
4399741 mix grill know how the community feel and they need to work with them if there are any problems
4399742 we have got to win and hope cheshire dont it is as simple as that

4399744 hunty has done terrific in the role hes a good player and good players can play anywhere it may be that he takes to it and it might be a continuing experiment
4399745 no bones about it if i could convince bruce to join aeg and join the galaxy hed be the ideal guy to come in here
4399746 theres not a better candidate theres not a better potential coach he knows more about the game i have more respect mr anschutz has great respect for bruce so wed be honored to have him
4399747 you dont look at a guy like bruce as a contender
4399748 wed be honored and privileged if bruce was part of the organization but the conversation tonight was really geared toward his input toward and his feelings towards what weve done right and what weve done wrong with this franchise
4399749 in my opinion you have to look at bruce and believe that this is the best coach that this league has ever had
4399750 i dont think hes lost anything so it would be fantastic for this franchise if we could convince bruce to join us here but as i said we have a ways to go before were going to know whether or not thats the direction we or he are going in
4399751 we owe the team and the fans a quick conclusion to this process
4399752 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4399753 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4399754 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

4399756 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4399757 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4399762 tayyab niaz underwent heart treatment in pakistan two years back but the mitral valve was ruptured during the medical procedure pakistani doctors referred him here and we successfully repaired the damage now he is fine and ready to go home
4399763 we carried out detailed tests and conducted an open heart surgery over 90 minutes on aug 1 he was in a difficult condition and without this treatment he may have died this is an independence day gift
4399764 due to this damage his heart started growing big which means more weakness and less life span
4399765 heart valve repair is a more complex operation it takes more time and effort however the results of a successful valve repair are gratifying
4399766 he underwent a check up on aug 14 and everything is progressing fine we have advised him three weeks rest and four weeks medication after that he can lead a normal life like you and me
4399767 though pakistan president musharaff is speaking against india we dont see any difference between indians and pakistanis

4399775 i dont know if we should celebrate a school taking away a teachers freedom of speech just because we dont like the speech
4399776 we confirmed that a case at a duck farm in asan was highly pathogenic
4399777 the drop in cases is because of the success of the government which is now unified and moving quickly
4399778 the increase in cases is because of the failure of the government
4399779 thank you for investing a very curious right wing mutual fund
4399780 and lets not forget that during 1918 1920 much of the world was still recovering from the strains of world war i poverty hunger unsanitary living conditions and stress likely made much of the global population ripe for a killer flu pandemic
4399781 a great proportion of the deaths in 1918 was probably due to secondary bacterial infections that followed the initial viral infections today antibiotics would be used to treat bacterial infections
4399782 appropriate treatment of patients with respiratory illness depends on accurate and timely diagnosis early diagnosis of influenza can reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics and provide the option of using antiviral therapy however because certain bacterial infections can produce symptoms similar to influenza bacterial infections should be considered and appropriately treated if suspected in addition bacterial infections can occur as a complication of influenza
4399783 laboratory testing to confirm human infection with h5n1 avian influenza is technically difficult some tests produce inconclusive or unreliable results
4399784 no i am married and i love my wife i do not want to get involved with you or anyone else

4399797 last year we had a bunch of geniuses but nevertheless pupils have enjoyed another excellent year
4399798 i send my congratulations to all the students and teachers who have achieved success this year being a former head teacher i know how nerve wracking today can be and i wish everyone well in future whether that be at college university or the start of a career
4399799 while we should celebrate the rise in this years standards of grades we still need to do more to drive up our overall standards to not only meet the national averages but to also surpass them we are still below the islands results in 2006 and some distance below the national average
4399800 we need to continue this years encouraging signs towards the next school year and continue to see improvements
4399801 we all have a responsibility to look after the future of the island and in many instances simple changes can be as effective as more formal methods
4399802 i dont really believe in ghosts but the footage is very strange to me it looks like a little girl skipping or dancing
4399803 one of the children actually looks towards the figure at the precise moment it runs past its all very weird
4399804 i read the story do you see a ghost with increasing interest as during a visit to blackgang chine last april i believe i saw the ghost of a small girl
4399805 i was just leaving one of the sawmill buildings when i felt compelled to turn around when i did there before me stood a young girl in a blue dress with blonde hair tied into two plaits after observing each other for a couple of seconds she just disappeared
4399806 she looked so real that if she hadnt just disappeared i never would have even known she wasnt a real girl
4399807 i wonder how many other visitors have seen her without realising shes actually not really there
4399808 i watched the video and observed something if this was a ghost then why did the two people in the video by the building obviously watch this so called ghost walk right past them and not jump out of their skins
4399809 their heads move along with the motion of the so called ghost i think something stinks in denmark
4399810 sorry to spoil your ghost story but it is obvious from the footage that the image is moving exactly in step with the camera operator

4399815 maybe treebeards right we dont belong here its too big for us what can we do in the end
4399816 everyone to whom much was given of him much will be required and from him to whom they entrusted much they will demand the more
4399817 i submit its better for us to give to questionable things than to not give at all

4399825 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4399826 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4399828 based on this principle the government should consider rationally and objectively whether to open uitm for non bumiputras
4399829 mca cannot agree to the statement that uitm should continue to be monopolised by bumiputras
4399830 our players should be more professional in the sense that they know what to do and not rely on the coaches while other players were jogging our players were still sleeping in the athletes village
4399831 we have a few back up players eager to move up we have to start focusing on the younger pairs
4399832 and its one two three what are we fighting for dont ask me i dont give a damn next stop is vietnam

4399834 the japanese race will be destroyed if the war continues
4399835 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4399836 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4399837 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4399838 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4399839 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4399840 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4399841 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4399842 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4399843 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4399844 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4399845 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4399846 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4399847 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4399848 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4399849 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4399850 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4399851 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4399852 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4399853 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4399854 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4399855 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4399856 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4399857 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4399858 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4399859 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4399860 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4399861 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4399862 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4399920 if we want to be different then we must change our thoughts
4399921 if you always do what youve always done then youll always get what youve always got
4399922 i know that if i wander away youre never coming after me and they say that someday youll follow me but for now you just dont fit in

4399927 i tried to go behind her but she stopped and moved back and i hit her
4399928 twenty of us started lifting up the bus about 10 more came to help
4399929 we didnt really communicate we all just started lifting we lifted it up and someone pulled her out
4399930 its amazing that all those people came out and helped its good to see people still care
4399931 i hope that as this child grows up he comes to understand that his mother gave her life in service to our city and we are forever grateful
4399932 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
4399933 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
4399934 during a photo session where the spanish national team was unveiled one of our sponsors asked us to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing and we made an oriental expression with our eyes
4399935 it seemed to us to be something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture i want to express that we have great respect for the orient and its people some of my best friends in toronto are of chinese origin
4399936 its the most wonderful feeling in the world to have him back
4399937 i was really so happy to see he was ok and well he was a little dirty and hadnt been bathed but none of that mattered
4399938 said he had been bathing the girl when he grabbed her leg and she fell and hit her head on the tub
4399939 he took her out and put her on a chair in her room she started to convulse and struck her head on the chair and became unresponsive he then grabbed her around her throat and shook her

4399945 the security detail is not to leave their job protecting the governor unless they get something in writing from the governor himself
4399946 they should have a piece of paper signed by the governor and this is something gov paterson understands and is comfortable with
4399947 i know the governor has 24 hour state police protect that travels with him one has to wonder where were they
4399948 the only thing ill say is i received two different letters i turned them over to the league authorities as was recommended and its in their hands
4399949 i conducted an interview with simpson in which he confessed to sending the letters
