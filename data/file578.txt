5780041 its the job ive always talked about wanting after my playing career inside the nfl has been a staple of television for a long time the show digs deeper into the games and the issues surrounding the league more than any other football show out there i think this new approach will be fresh for my part i just came off the field and ive got 13 years of experience in the trenches to bring to the table
5780042 with his defensive perspective sapp is the perfect complement to simms and collinsworth
5780043 and having just come off the field his energy will help push the boundaries of the show to new limits we are thrilled to have him on showtime
5780044 warren sapp never held back on the field and we dont expect him to hold back in his commentary
5780045 football fans tuned in to watch him play each week we expect them to do the same each week to hear what he has to say

5780148 i think last spring was a good opportunity for us and the team to really start to get on the same page with what we were asking of them and teaching them what our expectation levels are
5780149 that was a good beginning the spring combined with beginning of preseason practice here has been a good chance to create the type of culture in the gym necessary to make this into a nationally recognized program
5780150 all three of them are great kids all three really care about the program and theyre going to work really hard to make the program better theyre good people to have in our program to set an example to their teammates and show what we are trying to do here were really lucky to have them
5780151 i think we have the players in the program right now to be as good as we want to be and the ncaa tournament is in the back of our minds
5780152 however right now we just need to work on getting better every single day in the gym we need to get better individually as a team and as a program and we need to keep bringing in the right type of players to make that happen
5780153 michelle obviously had a good year last year she really took some big steps forward in the spring and not only established herself as a go to player on the team but really came out as one of the leaders on the team which was really good to see as a freshman
5780154 she possesses all the intangibles that great players have and i expect a lot of great things from her
5780155 maggie had a great spring and shes a really knowledgeable player
5780156 im looking for her to come out with a consistent fire and energy if she can do that shes really going to help us win some matches this year
5780157 coming in maddi is as physically gifted as any player ive ever coached at that position
5780158 were really excited about her skills she just needs to learn the technical side of what were doing so she can build the confidence to be an elite player here once that happens great things will happen for her
5780159 shes a great kid who works extremely hard shes passionate about the game and takes it seriously
5780160 she had a great spring and were going to ask her to do a lot of different things
5780161 mary beth with her height and athletic ability is one of the best talents ive ever coached
5780162 her vertical leap has improved a lot in the off season i want her to come out with an improved confidence this season with the idea that shes going to take over some matches as a blocker she already does that but we need her to be an offensive force
5780163 brittneys a great kid a really hard working kid she has a great attitude and really wants to do well
5780164 shes an excellent athlete and her intelligence should really ease the transition into a new position
5780165 i think katie is one of the best players on the team at doing what theyre supposed to do in all responsibilities of the position they play
5780166 she executes her attacks and blocks correctly with great consistency in our offense we try to get the ball to the middles early so she has a chance for a great season shes a really strong athlete she hits all the sets well and she has a great feel for blocking
5780167 shes very bright and she wants to know how to play the right way i would expect a lot of big things from her in the program shes definitely going to compete for a spot right off the bat
5780168 if we can keep tedi healthy for a full four months thats going to be great for us shes a good player and shes had a good career here
5780169 however hayley got a lot of experience last year and shes really matured at the position if both of those players are playing well well be in pretty good shape and be able to run the 6 2 like i want
5780170 bethany is as neat a kid as ive ever coached
5780171 shes a really hard worker loves playing the game and is really analytical she so smart she over processes things at times shes a perfectionist the improvements shes made since last season should be noticeable right away if she can improve on her serving and serve receiving shes going to be a great libero i also see her asserting herself more and more as a leader on this team which is pretty neat in a sophomore
5780172 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5780173 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance
5780174 i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5780175 there are staff that are extraordinarily kind there are staff that are singling her out for special attention
5780176 theres nowhere she can go to be alone theres nowhere she can go to get peace
5780177 we feel shes well managed we havent heard about any outward threats by other prisoners we train our staff to treat all our prisoners equally

5780369 noting a conversation that i had about the need for additional projects for this years gems students jessica offered several excellent suggestions on how to strengthen the proposed 2008 gems curriculum
5780370 after it became clear that building the computers would not take all the time allotted for the week we were asked to develop additional activities for the students
5780371 i was pleased to have jessica take an interest in this valuable outreach program for youth and i was most impressed and appreciative when she volunteered to serve as both instructor and mentor
5780372 the resulting module concentrated on electrical and computer engineering the gems students built the computer wrote a handful of programs in the high level language c assembled and soldered a robotic mouse learned about soldering safely and built web sites
5780373 jessica played an extremely vital role in this years gems program and i received very positive feedback from all of the students jessica was able to challenge and encourage the gems participants which is so important in a one week program teeming with young teens she certainly has a bright future
5780374 i had an awesome and rewarding experience working with gems the summer before my senior year of high school i attended a site which is a similar engineering camp at ua and it was one of the best times of my life since then i have hoped to be a counselor for that program because i am a big advocate for engineering and love helping anyone wondering if the field is right for them
5780375 its a tough time for her and i hope she is able to cope with this pain

5780457 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5780458 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5780459 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows

5780980 but from i have seen of him ive been very impressed i always like to see manager get involved in the coaching side of things which he does
5780981 despite the last campaign not going well he didnt have to do much lifting of players spirits were professional footballers who love playing for our country and were excited about the qualifiers ahead
5780982 a lot of the younger players who were introduced in the last campaign are maturing all the time and the manager will help in getting the best out of them

5781032 the mutation that causes most cases of wilson disease is well known but our study looks at the overall puzzle to see how such a small mutation can alter the shape and function of such a large and complex protein

5781507 original y al mismo tiempo cl sica de un personaje valiente que rodeado de un grupo de inadaptados lucha por lo que cree contra enormes obst culos
5781508 hemos determinado que no podemos seguir la relaci n como siempre
5781509 la alianza est considerando seriamente las implicancias de las acciones rusas para la relaci n otan rusia
5781510 no estamos abandonando el consejo otan rusia pero mientras las fuerzas rusas est n ocupando b sicamente una gran parte de georgia no puedo considerar una reuni n del consejo otan rusia a ning n nivel
5781511 pero debo agregar que no tenemos la intenci n de cerrar todas las puertas de comunicaci n con rusia
5781512 i have another project based on the life of comedian bill hicks which is going from treatment to draft stage with kiwi writer mark staufer
5781513 a coach never feels you are as good as you can be but were close and its important for us just to focus on this moment and thats what im trying to get across to the guys and australia is that moment not anybody else
5781514 they have five or six nba players but we beat them in the last european championship so we believe we can do it again especially because they are not playing that well
5781515 young people have too much confidence and it is difficult for them to be realistic
5781516 but the best thing about young people is they never give up
5781517 i dont think for me coaching against his countrymen will be psychological because i did it before in 2004
5781518 they have a lot of experience maybe more than us

5781524 was in the midst of his only formal art training the mail order landon school of illustrating and cartooning
5781525 he liked my work he said but when his samples fell out across the desk they were so good it made me want to jump out the window he was still in high school at the time
5781526 i had the job to help out this guy who was doing the san fransisco style they called it
5781527 it would be impossible for me to try to explain what that style was but it was so horrible for me to do it
5781528 it took a little while to get the plans out and just how we were going to do this
5781529 a year ago we didnt even have the equipment to move to the units
5781530 it is better to be wrong with the people than to be right against the people
5781531 none of this is high tech it can be done
5781532 i expressed the view that its obviously a critical relationship from new zealands point of view we fully support the work of the current new zealand government in terms of building a single economic market with australia
5781533 we fully support this campaign because the seeds of workable reform are planted in efforts like this diverse stakeholders from across the spectrum working together to find common ground
5781534 over the past two years ahips board of directors has developed a range of comprehensive policy proposals to ensure that all americans have access to affordable high quality health care our plan is coverage you can afford coverage you can keep coverage for all americans
5781535 while offering solutions is important we know that real progress will not happen unless stakeholders reach out and work together thats why we are pleased to be here to lend our support as the aha the american cancer society the catholic health association families usa and nfib come together to launch this new campaign
5781536 i eked out that last inch to dip him on the line that would have been absolutely devastating to come that close then just miss out i thought i had it with 60 to go then with 20 to go i saw him coming he screamed in despair when he realised he didnt get it
5781537 it really didnt hit me till i started the victory lap and got to the back straight and i really couldnt hold it back any more and broke down in tears
5781538 that you start to believe it yourself i truly did believe it on the start line that it was there for the taking
5781539 this is just absolutely huge for new zealand and for athletics in general
5781540 we have such a rich tradition jack lovelock john walker peter snell three olympic gold medalists and world record holders i was not able to get the gold but with the standard of competition and spread that this sport has reached worldwide now to get a bronze medal to me means just as much
5781541 i feel sometimes like im representing a huge range of track and field fans
5781542 so its just an honour to be able to carry that mantle and reach the medal podium i know theres going to be millions of people around the world to whom this means a lot and give all young kids hope that someone from a town like lower hutt of 100 000 people where track and field is not big i come from a high school of 2000 kids and one of only two people who ran track and to come from that and get a chance to be on the medal podium really means a huge amount
5781543 i think what we are mainly responding to david and i is the will of the fans which is really telling us that they want to see a scary chucky movie again they want to go back to the straightforward horror rather than the horror comedy
5781544 we know who the guys that are our leaders so to speak it s easier for us as a defense to kind of focus in on what we are and what we need to do in order to be a good team this year
5781545 theres no such thing as off the record anymore theres no such thing as private moments anymore
5781546 through this restructuring we sharpen our focus on two distinct large and growing segments of the healthcare industry by aligning our resources reducing costs and helping to speed decision making for our customers
5781547 in many ways these changes formalize the organization we began to put in place 18 months ago and will make us a stronger company that has a greater focus on both our supplier customers and provider customers with a goal of creating more value for shareholders
5781548 tsa does not approve the products of any manufacturer it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to determine that the bag provides a clear x ray image thereby being checkpoint friendly
5781549 we have proven were good enough to foot it with the big teams we just lack a little bit of quality to break into the top four
5781550 we feel we deserve to be in the top six well be bitterly disappointed if we dont make it

5781620 el tsj en sala constitucional decidi anular un procedimiento de amparo de nosotros y al declararlo nulo ten a efecto entonces la orden de volver a contratar con el instituto lo sab amos desde el 13 de este mes y no lo hab amos hecho quiz s nosotros aeropostal debimos presentarnos ac el 14 de este mes para notificar a los trabajadores y no lo hicimos debimos ser m s previsivos
5781621 vamos a mantener cuatro counters antes ten amos once y oper bamos los mismos cuatro as que mantendremos los que operamos porque lo que no estamos necesitando lo puede utilizar otra aerol nea no estamos disminuyendo en nada nuestra capacidad ni nos han quitado nada que de acuerdo a la ley no corresponda

5781636 he remained conscious throughout the whole extraction process we cut the pole down to probably within one foot of the casualty both front and back using hydraulic cutting equipment
5781637 he was transported by air ambulance sat in an upright position with the pole still through his chest

5781647 most states require that children get certain vaccines before they can start school

5781694 vishays acquisition last year of the pcs business helped it climb two places in the rankings for power discretes this potential acquisition would see it surge past all competitors and lead the power discretes market by some way it would also seriously strengthen its position in power ics particularly in segments that it has not traditionally addressed
5781695 the bid highlights the firm focus being placed by many firms on power management and is not surprising given the consistent and high growth ims research projects for this market over the next five years
5781696 tal como se advirti desde que se otorgaron facultades legislativas al ejecutivo en torno al cumplimiento del tlc con estados unidos este solo ha dado decretos que quitan derechos a los pueblos ind genas y que en definitiva propician conflictos
5781697 esto es parte de la criminalizaci n de la protesta instaurada por el gobierno aprista y cuyas leyes relativas deben ser derogadas
5781698 el pa s colabora con la aprobaci n de medidas modelo para el cap tulo del tlc esto es cu les son las mejores pr cticas en los acuerdos negociados de la regi n y c mo puede ayudarse para incrementar su calidad y homogeneidad

5782451 it takes time for materials to warm up and cool off which is why the hottest part of the day on earth is usually around 2 or 3 p m rather than local noon when sunlight is the most intense

5782506 the poll highlights an inconvenient truth many of us often question ourselves why is there so much spam the answer is enough people are purchasing products from spam to make it a worthwhile and profitable endeavour for spammers

5782518 the properties included in this transaction are locations featuring stores that are either new or recently expanded so we do not see a need to relocate these stores in the foreseeable future this enables us to monetize these sites at attractive rates while creating financial flexibility

5782535 for all his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell

5782560 my dads life was brand new those last 14 months
5782561 his relationship with me and with god were both reconciled jesus christ is a peacemaker
5782562 if we confess our sins to god he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from every wrong
5782563 first we surrender our right to get even second we rediscover the humanity of our wrongdoer that the person who wronged us is a complex weak confused fragile person not all that different from us and third we wish our wrongdoer well

5782594 this recent installment of our survey series features interesting insights into the psychological profile of the global it professional and the differences that may exist geographically
5782595 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so i knew my father pretty well at least better than some of those who entitle themselves to his legacy and his supposed ideals and even i would not presume to say publicly what i know he thought or felt this is especially dangerous in the case of political affiliation
5782596 it is unfair and presumptuous to use him to bolster any platform i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance

5782598 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
5782599 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable
5782600 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of co ordination to patch

5782612 i wonder how well pakistans nuclear weapons are secured compared to ours especially at a time like this
5782613 its not iraq or afghanistan where we do see a path forward where we do see success it is pakistan
5782614 were not sure of the outcome in pakistan its very very unstable
5782615 but then again his control of the military in pakistan has been a stabilizing factor because when you have 168 million people the sixth largest country in the world and you have the taliban coming through the mountains from afghanistan and frankly taking your own security people hostage you have a very troubling security environment
5782616 and security is paramount to their economy coming around right now their economy is going in the wrong direction after a few years of growth
5782617 so its a very unstable insecure in a country like pakistan they could be weeks away from chaos or improvement we dont know which thats what makes it so volatile thats whats so dangerous about pakistan today in the middle of this upheaval a civilian government was elected and thats great but security is also incredibly important and somehow the security leadership and the civil government leadership are going to have to come together as quick as possible our country better watch closely the events in pakistan because its a linchpin in that region

5782664 when we crossed the line the three of us just looked at one another
5782665 i cant describe the feeling because you just know that youre the best in the whole world at what you do
5782666 we are particularly happy to be associated with this victory and to live one of the greatest moments of our three years long partnership
5782667 i have become more fascinated with the ambiguity of an image if you remove the facts and the dates and are just left with the image that image to me is strongest when each viewer can attach their own meaning to it
5782668 unfortunately no one seems to have any photos of the original windmill but many older and long time upper clutha residents remember it well
5782669 go ahead and jump off a bridge or out of a plane but also make time to slow down and experience queenstown without the adrenaline
5782670 the message that you dont have to be an extreme adventurer to enjoy your time in queenstown is an important one and a key part of our identity thats successfully hitting home with many visitors
5782671 looking like a small town but displaying the energy of a small city
5782672 more gung ho visitors to queenstown might be happiest dangling off a giant rubber band but as theyre submerged in the icy kawarau river theyll be missing out on some of central otagos most interesting vineyards just up the road

5782674 while we have no control over the content we do know that next to word of mouth guidebooks are the second most influential resource in the travel planning process
5782675 the applicant is wanting to have various sites not meeting this requirement ranging from 600sq m to 2678sq m we would like to see the subdivision abide by the district plan
5782676 an individual and isolated water supply scheme is proposed within the application this will result in a proliferation of council controlled schemes in the lake hayes vicinity
5782677 there is a concern about the number of bores already in the area and the capacity of the surrounding aquifer upgrading of the existing lake hayes estate scheme should be promoted by the council
5782678 it has changed its mind apparently because it believes it made an error
5782679 i had been expecting feedback on the actual effects of the ird commissioners decision in terms of the costs

5782685 we are immensely proud to have played an important role in this effort and to have helped scott and steve make aviation history
5782686 weve had to take too many conferences away from dunedin
5782687 we had to follow our procedures to contain the powder and then make the area safe
5782688 it was possible that the substance could have leaked and we wanted to check out the post office and the mail sorting area
5782689 when you dont know what it is you have to work on it being the worst case scenario
5782690 we have to give our people the best protection we can
5782691 the ministry of justice has a standard security process in place for such incidents and this process was appropriately followed
5782692 it takes less than 10 particles to cause an infection if you have somebody with diarrhoea it would not be unreasonable to assume there were 1 million particles per ml of diarrhoea
5782693 wash your hands is exactly the right message there is no other way of knocking it off
5782694 this would not be a good weekend for anyone to break the law
5782695 it debt is something they will want to stay in control of especially with the tighter credit conditions at present
5782696 our primary concern is the confusion that would arise around a vote on two quite separate issues one being the pggw partnership proposal vote in which there has been significant investment of time and resources and the other being matters that are non binding and which can be considered following the outcomes of two other meetings
5782697 only alliance chairman owen poole isnt interested assuming he has got the backing of his board but shareholders have indicated they want this issue looked at
5782698 in this economic environment it leaves scott in a very strong position especially if they want to consider more acquisitions
5782699 weve raised our earnings forecast given the rocklabs acquisition it appears to be an excellent and complimentary fit for scott

5782711 one of the things ive noticed as a mom is ive been horrible about making my kids read
5782712 if they read just 15 minutes a night that gets them focused back on their reading skills
5782713 or for kids that arent readers yet parents can make sure they are reading to their children
5782714 slowly move it back every few days work it back earlier by a half hour so its not a huge jolt
5782715 this can really decrease anxiety and gives kids a sense of control
5782716 if you drop them off for the first week and then they start riding the bus they havent gone through the same things other kids do
5782717 life is about problem solving and helping a child understand options teaches them to problem solve what you ultimately want for your child is an independent individual accountable for their actions
5782718 i keep numbers of classmates from the previous year and then my daughter can call them if they havent kept in touch over the summer and find out who might be in her class

5782725 its been a good job ill miss it but im ready to go it feels good the right thing
5782726 this is my time its good and going to be a students even funnier
5782727 personally i think this document is a sham it will do away with 40 000 people who come to the camping ground every year
5782728 in the last six to eight months ive been told by lots of people around town and by members of the working party that the camping ground would be the focus it didnt matter what i said or other people said that would be the case
5782729 the report indicates that is where it has got to the public needs to know that these people around the table today have not made a determination we do have an open mind
5782730 we used to find economics quite dry reading it from a textbook made it difficult for us to understand how it applies to us in real life its so complex

5782748 while it is difficult to know for certain the tendency to believe in the paranormal appears to be there from the beginning
5782749 what changes is the content of the paranormal for example very few people believe in faeries and elves these days but as belief in faeries faded other beliefs such as belief in ufos emerged to take their place
5782750 it is an artifact of our brains desire to find cause and effect
5782751 that ability to predict the future is what makes humans smart but it also has side effects like superstitions and belief in the paranormal
5782752 humans first started believing in the supernatural because they were trying to understand things they couldnt explain
5782753 its basically the same process as mythology at one point people didnt understand why the sun rose and set each day so they suggested that a chariot pulled the sun across the heavens

5782758 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave
5782759 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying a greater part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at any level
5782760 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitry medvedev which is not happening at the moment
5782761 but the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation in the community of states
5782762 a very clear statement that nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5782763 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5782764 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5782765 we remain concerned by russias actions during this crisis and remind russia of its responsibility for maintaining security and order in the areas where it exercises control especially in light of continuing reports of russias deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure

5782783 supe que hab a sucedido algo irreparable en el momento en que un hombre me abri la puerta de esa habitaci n de hotel y vi a mi mujer sentada al fondo mirando por la ventana de muy extra a manera fue a mi regreso de un viaje corto s lo cuatro d as por cosas de trabajo dice aguilar y asegura que al partir la dej bien cuando me fui no le pasaba nada raro o al menos nada fuera de lo habitual ciertamente nada que anunciara lo que iba a sucederle durante mi ausencia salvo sus propias premoniciones claro est pero c mo iba aguilar a creerle si agustina su mujer siempre anda pronosticando calamidades l ha tratado por todos los medios de hacerla entrar en raz n pero ella no da su brazo a torcer e insiste en que desde peque a tiene lo que llama un don de los ojos o visi n de lo venidero y s lo dios sabe dice aguilar lo que eso ha trastornado nuestras vidas esta vez como todas mi agustina pronostic que algo saldr a mal y yo como siempre pas por alto su pron stico me fui de la ciudad un mi rcoles la dej pintando de verde las paredes del apartamento y el domingo siguiente a mi regreso la encontr en un hotel al norte de la ciudad transformada en un ser aterrado y aterrador al que apenas reconozco no he podido saber qu le sucedi durante mi ausencia porque si se lo pregunto me insulta hay que ver cu n feroz puede llegar a ser cuando se exalta me trata como si yo ya no fuera yo ni ella fuera ella intenta explicar aguilar y si no puede es porque l mismo no lo comprende la mujer que amo se ha perdido dentro de su propia cabeza hace ya catorce d as que la ando buscando y me va la vida en encontrarla pero la cosa es dif cil es angustiosa a morir y jodidamente dif cil es como si agustina habitara en un plano paralelo al real cercano pero inabordable es como si hablara en una lengua extranjera que aguilar vagamente reconoce pero que no logra comprender la trastornada raz n de mi mujer es un perro que me tira tarascadas pero que al mismo tiempo me env a en sus ladridos un llamado de auxilio que no atino a responder agustina es un perro fam lico y malherido que quisiera volver a casa y no lo logra y al minuto siguiente es un perro vagabundo que ni siquiera recuerda que alguna vez tuvo casa
5782784 el sol no hab a nacido todav a hubiera sido imposible distinguir el mar del cielo excepto por los mil pliegues ligeros de las ondas que le hac an semejarse a una tela arrugada poco a poco a medida que una palidez se extend a por el cielo una franja sombr a separ en el horizonte al cielo del mar y la inmensa tela gris se ray con grandes l neas que se mov an debajo de su superficie sigui ndose una a otra persigui ndose en un ritmo sin fin al aproximarse a la orilla cada una de ellas adquir a forma se hinchaba y se romp a arrojando sobre la arena un delgado velo de blanca espuma la ola se deten a para alzarse enseguida nuevamente suspirando como una criatura dormida cuya respiraci n va y viene inconscientemente poco a poco la franja oscura del horizonte se aclar se hubiera dicho un sedimento depositado en el fondo de una vieja botella dejando al cristal su transparencia verde en el fondo el cielo tambi n se hizo transl cido cual si el sedimento blanco se hubiera desprendido o cual si el brazo de una mujer tendida debajo del horizonte hubiera alzado una l mpara y bandas blancas amarillas y verdes se alargaron sobre el cielo igual que las varillas de un abanico enseguida la mujer alz m s alto su l mpara y el aire pareci dividirse en fibras desprenderse de la verde superficie en una palpitaci n ardiente de fibras amarillas y rojas como los resplandores humeantes de un fuego de alegr a poco a poco las fibras se fundieron en un solo fluido en una sola incandescencia que levant la pesada cobertura gris del cielo transform ndola en un mill n de tomos de un azul tierno la superficie del mar fue adquiriendo gradualmente transparencia y yaci ondulando y despidiendo destellos hasta que las franjas oscuras desaparecieron casi totalmente el brazo que sosten a la l mpara se alz todav a m s lentamente se alz m s y m s alto hasta que una inmensa llama se hizo visible un arco de fuego ardi en el borde del horizonte y a su alrededor el mar ya no fue sino una sola extensi n de oro la luz golpe sucesivamente los rboles del jard n iluminando una tras otra las hojas que se tornaron transparentes un p jaro gorje muy alto hubo una pausa m s abajo otro p jaro repiti su gorjeo el sol utiliz las paredes de la casa y se apoy como la punta de un abanico sobre una persiana blanca el dedo del sol marc sombras azules en el arbusto junto a la ventana del dormitorio la persiana se estremeci dulcemente pero todo en la casa continu siendo vago e insustancial afuera los p jaros cantaban sus vac as melod as

5782786 sinti en su boca el suave olor de la fiebre y lo aspiro como si quisiera llenarse de las intimidades de su cuerpo y en ese momento se imagin que ya llevaba muchos a os en su casa y que se estaba muriendo de pronto tuvo la clara sensaci n que no podr a sobrevivir a la muerte de ella se acostar a a su lado y querr a morir con ella conmovido por esa imagen hundi en ese momento la cara en la almohada junto a la cabeza de ella y permaneci as durante mucho tiempo y le dio pena que en una situaci n como aquella en la que un hombre de verdad ser a capaz de tomar inmediatamente una decisi n l dudase privando as de su significado al momento mas hermoso que hab a vivido jam s estaba arrodillado junto a su cama y pensaba que no podr a sobrevivir a su muerte se enfad consigo mismo pero luego se le ocurri que en realidad era bastante natural que no supiera que quer a el hombre nunca puede saber que debe querer porque vive solo una vida y no tiene modo de compararla con sus vidas precedentes ni de enmendarla en sus vidas posteriores no existe posibilidad alguna de comprobar cual de las decisiones es la mejor porque no existe comparaci n alguna el hombre lo vive todo a la primera y sin preparaci n como si un actor representase su obra sin ning n tipo de ensayo pero que valor puede tener la vida si el primer ensayo para vivir es ya la vida misma por eso la vida parece un boceto pero ni un boceto es la palabra precisa porque un boceto es siempre un borrador de algo la preparaci n para un cuadro mientras que el boceto que es nuestra vida es un boceto para nada un borrador sin cuadro si cada uno de los instantes de nuestra vida se va a repetir infinitas veces estamos clavados a la eternidad como jesucristo a la cruz la imagen es terrible en el mundo del eterno retorno descansa sobre cada gesto el peso de una insoportable responsabilidad ese es el motivo por el cual nietzsche llam a la idea del eterno retorno la carga m s pesada pero si el eterno retorno es la carga m s pesada entonces nuestras vidas pueden aparecer sobre ese tel n de fondo en toda su maravillosa levedad la carga m s pesada nos destroza somos derribados por ella nos aplasta contra la tierra pero en la poes a amatoria de todas las pocas la mujer desea cargar con el peso del cuerpo del hombre la carga m s pesada es por lo tanto a la vez la imagen de la m s intensa plenitud de la vida cuanto m s pesada sea la carga m s a ras de tierra estar nuestra vida m s real y verdadera ser por el contrario la ausencia absoluta de carga hace que el hombre se vuelva m s ligero que el aire vuele hacia lo alto se distancie de la tierra de su ser terreno que sea real s lo a medias y sus movimientos sean tan libres como insignificantes

5782790 for years the gay rights movement has sought safety in numbers
5782791 kinseys classic 1948 studies suggest that about 10 of american adults are homosexual a figure that more recent surveys support
5782792 i feel the 10 percent figure is probably about right because many homosexuals fear to admit their sexual orientation
5782793 some gay activists now concede that they exploited the kinsey estimate for its tactical value not its accuracy we used that figure when most gay people were entirely hidden to try to create an impression of our numerousness says tom stoddard former head of the lambda legal defense fund
5782794 well whyd you go see mirrors in the first place
5782795 receiving the body and blood of christ unworthily is a sacrilege
5782796 if it is done deliberately in mortal sin it is a sacrilege
5782797 public officials who with knowledge and consent uphold actions that are against the divine and eternal moral law for example if they support abortion which entails the taking of innocent and defenseless human lives a person who commits sin in this way should be publicly admonished in such a way as to not receive communion until he or she has reformed his life
5782798 if a person who has been admonished persists in public mortal sin and attempts to receive communion the minister of the eucharist has the obligation to deny it to him why above all for the salvation of that person preventing him from committing a sacrilege
5782799 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
5782800 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
5782801 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb
5782802 it is not with the intention of interfering in public life but rather in the spiritual state of the politician or public official who if catholic should follow the divine law in the public sphere as well
5782803 therefore it is simply ridiculous and wrong to try to silence a pastor accusing him of interfering in politics so that he cannot do good to the soul of a member of his flock
5782804 to bear witness to our faith not only in private in our homes but also in our public lives with others in order to bear strong witness to christ

5782963 this highly pigmented chubby crayon delivers long lasting wear with some moisture the rich matte finish works remarkably well in the strong reds though any of the colors can be topped with gloss just know this affects length of wear vitamin e and silicone help you forget youre wearing rich color a pencil makes for pretty precise application but eventually youll be reaching for a nars custom sized sharpener which you must buy separately boo
5782964 as a lip liner it is a must have apply to the outer rim of your lips it wonderfully prevents lipstick feathering creates a nice clean edge line for the mouth without embarrassing liner edges conditions the area and is just pleasant to use i wouldnt be without mine definitely a staple in my makeup bag
5782965 it provides a soft moisturizing feel that makes it easy to apply on dry or moist lips the feel also allows you to color in your entire lip for a long lasting color without over drying or feathering it wont crumble on your lips which is another bonus overall a great lip pencil that does it all
5782966 this lip liner is smooth and stays very well without looking dry or caked on like a lot of long wear lip liners this one stays just as well if not better since it doesnt flake off choose a color that is just slightly darker than your lips and you can have a natural soft look that blends in with any lipstick shade
5782967 i use it to line and fill in for the greatest staying power i use a gloss or lipstick over it it stays and stays even if the gloss or lipstick wears off it never feathers or bleeds either this is another product i buy in multiples and keep in my vanity purse and desk drawer easily sharpens too and doesnt drag this is the best lip liner ive ever used and the price is right
5782968 i hate the look of lip liner showing through lipstick can anyone say tacky ive tried other invisible lip liners but this one is the best it isnt crumbly it glides on smoothly and it sees me through to the end of my day no lipstick bleeding or feathering even with my chanel red lipstick it is reasonably priced lasts and works what else could you ask for i just wont make up without it
5782969 you can pencil me in on this duo because i love it one less item to carry in my purse the lip pencil goes on smoothly and does not smash or break off it doesnt feel like you are tearing your lips off lasts for hour s and you dont have to worry about running out at the wrong time i replace mine with refills when the first one runs out it helps fill in the cracks but leaves a smooth line which i appreciate greatly the lip brush is great and easy to apply lipstick with you will be glad you spent money on this
5782970 i use no 956 every day and just love how it looks it has lasted me for almost a year now for 99 cents you cant go wrong buy a bunch and you wont feel guilty
5782971 i bought this liner just before my wedding in 2005 i needed something that would stay on well and look similar to my natural lip color i wore lipstick over it of course no 9 was such a great color i continue to use it every day i like the consistency of the product and ive found that the pencil lasts me about seven months
5782972 i love these lip liners there are many colors to choose from you dont need a sharpener good for a girl on the go and they are smooth and easy to apply an added bonus the color holds up well on the lips so that means less re application it is almost too good to be true but it is
5782973 as i have matured i have found a need for a lip liner to define my lips and to keep lipsticks from bleeding avons ultra luxury liner does a great job it glides on easily and stays the price is a bargain i have been happy to have found this product
5782974 i was so surprised to see two other fans of palm beach
5782975 the liner isnt just great for drawing outside of the lip line although it keeps gloss and lipstick perfectly in place its also great for creating an arch under the brow hiding blemishes and rimming the lower lash line to create wide awake eyes

5783601 she never accepted that she was disabled she saw it as a new challenge
5783602 and this is key all great achievers in life dont understand limitation whereas others see limitations and reasons not to try she just saw challenges

5783604 we had no food and no one to run our shelters
5783605 i asked them why they couldnt have told me before the hurricane
5783606 we opened up our school cafeterias and that was how we fed people
5783607 much of hidalgo lies in a floodplain and we wont put shelters anywhere where there might be flooding
5783608 how can we help people in shelters if the shelters are flooded
5783609 why would i put my people in shelters that were going to be under water we know the county well and we know where we are going to have flooding
5783610 at least they could have had their staging area in the neighboring county where we could get to them
5783611 i just couldnt believe it when they told me they werent coming
5783612 i had hospitals evacuating generators going out and it was just one more stressful situation to deal with

5783616 its like a gold mine thats been discovered right underneath my feet and its called the barnett shale
5783617 if people dont think corporations own and run and control the media in this day and age in this country then theyre not very informed
5783618 i think its a very ideological program and not the best use of money especially during tough economic times when more poor people are in need of cash assistance
5783619 i kind of feel like one of those big motivational speakers at a huge big conference somewhere

5783624 we love the thought of someone having the life changing opportunity of winning this dream lifestyle and it gets us out of the hassle of the property market with broken chains and viewings
5783625 as far as we know we are the first people to give players an opportunity to win a complete fully paid for property and business with no additional costs whatsoever
5783626 people who enter competitions for cars or property dont think about the maintenance costs later
5783627 so thats why were including an established successful on going business in order to give someone the millionaire lifestyle as well as the property
5783628 we know how lucky we were finding the right properties and also getting the chance to build a very successful business

5783639 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5783640 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5783641 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5783642 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5783643 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5783644 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5783645 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5783646 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5783647 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5783648 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5783649 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line

5783652 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5783653 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter

5783767 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5783768 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5783769 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5783770 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5783771 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5783772 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5783773 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5783774 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5783775 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5783776 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5783777 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5783778 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5783779 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5783780 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5783781 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5783782 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5783783 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5783784 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5783785 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5783786 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5783787 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5783788 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5783789 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5783790 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5783791 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5783792 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5783793 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5783794 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5783795 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5783796 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5783797 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5783798 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5783799 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5783800 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5783820 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
5783821 this picture solves an old family mystery my great grandfather who fought on the side of great britain in the boer war often told a story
5783822 discovering the amazing young men and women who make up the tr35 is one of the highlights of the year for us
5783823 the innovators on our 2008 list have made truly remarkable and valuable contributions
5783824 its really an exciting time because everyone is paying attention to the energy crisis
5783825 its such a great honor particularly given the quality of the people who have previously been named to the tr35
5783826 i must also recognize my wonderful collaborators without which this work would not have been possible and with whom i would like to share this award
5783827 if it wasnt profitable i wouldnt be able to stand here
5783828 we are proud to introduce 2k games showcase title bioshock to an entirely new audience
5783829 with the addition of the new add on game content we are able to extend the award winning adventure while maintaining the perfect harmony that millions of players around the world have fallen in love with
5783830 the practice overall both sides was the sharpest of camp so far
5783831 i think it was the most physical i think it was the sharpest the most competitive and execution on both sides was the highest
5783832 i am not so sure if it is because the end is in sight but the urgency of knowing their assignments have to be sound their technique has to be sound and the time is running out
5783833 so rather than seeing the end in sight as relief i think they are seeing more of an urgency
5783834 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5783835 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5783836 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5783837 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5783838 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5783839 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5783840 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5783841 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5783842 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5783843 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5783844 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5783845 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5783846 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5783847 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5783848 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5783849 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5783850 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5783851 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5783852 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5783853 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5783854 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5783855 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5783856 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5783857 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5783858 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5783859 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5783860 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5783861 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5783894 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5783895 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5783896 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5783897 it is not timely its not in the good spirit of our national day if we go ahead with the concert it is contrary to what we are preparing for

5783902 she is so kind sweet and very beautiful shes also very funny which always is a great thing shes also very much like me she makes me very happy it feels real and honest and i have more of a continuous smile than i have ever had before
5783903 i absolutely adore him and ill do whatever is necessary to help him become the next president im so excited that he is running
5783904 im aware that he does have some factors against him for example his father is african and not an african american and he doesnt have much experience
5783905 but i think he can do a lot for people of my generation hes such a dashing statesman i love that he just lays it all on the table he already wrote the book hes just everything you want a president to be
5783906 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
5783907 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day and one that well never forget
5783908 that was a scary moment for all of us seeing your friend collapse like that is something that nobody wants to experience hes doing much better now and taking it easy on the bus

5783927 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5783928 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5783947 people have always been talking about how digital media will take away audiences from tv
5783948 thats just not happening maybe this will be a wake up call for a lot of people

5783959 at the start of games youll see teams come out with a lot of energy then as the game goes on we keep it turned on and we wind up wearing people down
5783960 were not afraid to get on someone if someones not playing defense
5783961 when you look at all the other teams that have been together for so long they can talk to each other the jerry colangelo play eliminated the second guessing of when to get on each other that only makes us better
5783962 i dont think theres another team in this tournament that can play defense the way we can in terms of the style of defense
5783963 because we can get after it positions one through five can get after it
5783964 his voice helped last summer when he began talking more on the defensive end hes continued to be our quarterback on defense

5783985 although ahmed was deeply religious he was also 21 years old intelligent and had been interviewed by law enforcement twice before
5783986 there is nothing to suggest that ahmeds will was critically affected by the agents various appeals to his muslim beliefs and there is nothing inherently coercive about such tactics
5783987 it makes no sense to conclude that a suspect has voluntarily given a statement to law enforcement officers when he has been promised he will not be arrested and left alone if he talks but will be arrested and prosecuted if he does not

5783991 president bush was the last holdout said a think tank expert who worked with the pakistani ambassador to washington but after a good luncheon at the white house with people who had their hearts in the right place mr bush also realised that he can no longer save mr musharraf
5783992 the prime minister took a team of musharraf experts with him to the luncheon and they played a key role in persuading mr bush to stop supporting the pakistani leader
5783993 once this was done the pakistanis knew that the americans will no longer try to save mr musharraf so they made their move for impeachment the expert said
5783994 while mr bush had accepted the argument that mr musharraf could no longer be saved he still wanted to make sure that the pakistani leader was not penalised
5783995 besides sending his own ambassador to the coalition leaders to negotiate a safe exit indemnity from penalisation and a secure stay in pakistan or abroad for mr musharraf mr bush also asked two key allies britain and saudi arabia to help
5783996 after months of belated recognition by american officials that he had become a waning asset in the campaign against terrorism

5784020 i extracted some hair from the alleged corpse and examined it and had some concerns
5784021 we burned said sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair
5784022 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head

5784026 on behalf of myself i can say with certainty matthew whitton and ricky dyer are not the best bigfoot trackers in the world
5784027 in terms of global trade cer has delivered an impressive level of integration but more remains to be done
5784028 the challenge before governments on both sides of the tasman is to drive forward the creation of the single economic market building a seamless economy between australia and new zealand of more than 25 million people
5784029 the global economy is going through some turbulent waters financial market instability rising oil and food prices and slowing growth in some major developed economies
5784030 and a central element of that is even closer economic engagement with new zealand
5784031 i want to see us working more closely together bilaterally driving towards the single economic market
5784032 australia wants to be ambitious here our aim is to reduce the amount of screening that currently occurs in relation to investment flows between the two countries
5784033 furthermore we need to develop a regime which facilitates the portability of retirement savings across the tasman
5784034 this measure goes to the heart of removing disincentives to the free movement of people across the tasman by allowing individuals to consolidate their retirement savings
5784035 wherever possible i want to look at how we can extend to new zealand the work we are doing in the coag business regulation and competition working group on national regulatory arrangements

5784038 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5784039 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5784040 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5784041 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5784042 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5784043 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
5784044 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
5784045 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
5784046 its a good tool that some teachers shy away from because they are worried its going to have negative consequences
5784047 i think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators even in elementary school
5784048 by outlining specific barriers to use in this population we provide a framework for future early interventions such as parent education and addressing confidentiality concerns
5784049 multiple misconceptions such as side effects that are not known to occur and concerns about confidentiality exist in this population and may influence future use
5784050 the mechanism of action through which this surgery is successful at improving gerd may be independent of weight loss and needs further examination
5784051 the magnitude of the obesity epidemic adds a staggering burden to our current health care system these studies point to the serious potential risks of gi disease for individuals who are overweight or obese
5784052 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
5784053 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
5784054 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
5784055 the mycoplasma infection completely blocked the protective response mice normally mount against tobacco smoke reducing antioxidant levels well below even those of mice breathing fresh air
5784056 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
5784057 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna
5784058 these higher levels of oxidative stress and damage are likely to predispose smokers with mycoplasma infections to lung disease such as copd or cancer
5784059 i think a little perspective is in order chelsea green and the author robert kuttner are taking an enormous risk in publishing this book i know its de rigueur to consider amazon enemy 1 but it just aint so its also important for booksellers to realize that the small publisher has just as monumental a task as the small bookstore our intention is to create demand that will result in selling through all copies in the marketplace of course if all of you cancel your orders it will mean that a really good and important book on obama will be effectively boycotted as i have written before the world is changing fast but the book business seems wedded to very traditional ways of publishing and selling a book that is too timely and important to be left out of the national political conversation this fall

5784211 from dealing with sinkholes and sludge to clean air and clean water garrett has proven time and time again he cant be bothered with the environmental safety of his constituents and he cant be trusted with the energy concerns of this country as illustrated by the admirable scores of garretts republican colleagues what matters is not whether an idea is democratic or republican but whether it is good for the country scott garretts record reveals that he is part of the special interest culture of corruption in washington that is endangering the safety and prosperity of our state and country

5784219 on the whole all of these threats that have been raining down on russia turned out to be empty words

5784258 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5784259 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5784260 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5784261 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5784262 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5784263 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5784264 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5784265 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5784266 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5784267 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5784268 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces

5784273 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge in that our stores are fun and unique
5784274 we have both what you need and what you want and during these tough economic times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5784275 wal mart has staked out the position with its save money live better tagline that they are the king of low prices
5784276 well save you money and well help your family make it through these economic times

5784344 weve sensed the need for something more hip in the infants and childrens clothing market since weve been around for 15 years many of emilys fans are now parents so those parent fans who appreciate emilys rock n roll presence will love this incarnation weve created specifically for the little ones plus kids love characters with attitude weve been able to combine that with enough charm to make emiwee palatable for both children and adults

5784353 the issue is not the act itself it is the profile of fans that follow the act wiltshire police do not have an issue with pete doherty or babyshambles

5784372 ironically last summer i was here in the jet set office one day and i was dealing with a lot of drama and i remember hanging up the phone and saying someone really ought to do a reality show on this business
5784373 well the next day out of nowhere we got a call from the producers of webdreams they told us about their show and said if we were willing to be on the show they would come do a screen test of all of us and if they liked what they saw they would follow us
5784374 it was like having a behind the scenes crew follow you everywhere you went filming everything you did
5784375 was both fun and aggravating but we knew going into it that there would be times we would be on camera that we didnt necessarily want to be
5784376 what surprised me the most is how much work it is having a tv crew follow you around
5784377 when you see these shows everything is seamless but there are times when you walk out a door and well the cameras have to come out to shoot you so you have to go back in the door then walk back out
5784378 i was also surprised at how much they filmed us there are five lives being followed on the show and were just one of those five so starting out i didnt think we would be filmed very often that wasnt the case they followed the making of on fire from inception all the way to the gayvn awards and documented every step of the way including going to the dvd replication house to film the dvds come off the press they were very thorough
5784379 my famous last words for saying someone should do a reality show doing the show was a great experience
5784380 ive seen them on tv and now i know exactly what its like to be on one webdreams filmed us from june of 2007 till february of 2008 by the end of the experience we all felt like they were part of our crew
5784381 the success of the first two seasons helped us get even more access to the industry and even deeper into the lives of our characters
5784382 full of character and real life drama webdreams fans will not be disappointed by this popular fly on the wall look at the online world of adult entertainment

5784387 how honest are we if we tell the truth most of the time amp stay silent only when telling the truth might get us fired or earn us a broken nose we need moral courage to be honest all the time

5784391 soy feliz con las cosas simples de la vida una simple casa en el barrio alto un simple jeep 4x4 una sencilla cuenta corriente y una sencilla novia modelo

5784393 tengo un problema no se que auto comprarme prefiero tener ese problema a no tener para comer como cuando era chico
5784394 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5784395 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5784396 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5784397 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5784398 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5784399 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5784400 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5784401 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5784402 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5784403 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5784404 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5784405 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5784406 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5784407 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5784408 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5784409 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5784410 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5784411 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5784412 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5784413 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5784414 for three years we have been saying that war is coming and the team has been working hard to deliver on this promise
5784415 in just a few weeks we are going to throw open our doors and invite more players into the game than ever before they will have a chance to delve into the open beta and see for themselves that war has arrived and it is glorious
5784416 because i have taken you out of the world the world hates you
5784417 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5784418 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5784419 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5784420 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5784421 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5784422 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5784423 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5784424 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5784425 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5784426 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5784427 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5784428 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5784429 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5784430 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5784431 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5784432 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5784433 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5784434 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5784435 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5784436 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5784437 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

5784439 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5784440 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5784441 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5784442 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5784443 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5784444 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5784445 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5784446 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5784447 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5784448 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5784449 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5784450 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5784451 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5784452 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5784453 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5784454 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5784455 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5784456 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5784457 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5784458 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5784459 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5784460 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5784461 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5784462 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5784463 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5784464 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5784465 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5784466 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5784467 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5784468 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5784469 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5784470 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers

5784474 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5784475 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5784477 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5784478 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5784479 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5784480 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5784481 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5784482 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

5784493 the single most important fact about internets development in last decade has been the extraordinary decline united states has faced with respect to our competitive partners we started the bush administration at no 5 we will end at no 22 and the question anybody should be asking about internet policy here is why we did so poorly and what change there might be to reverse that decline how will we change this decline and in particular in evaluating john mccains technology platform we should be asking whether in his platform there is something new or something different from what he has be espousing to this date something that might actually reverse the consequences of policies which he himself has been largely responsible for supporting now as i evaluate his policy in light of this question i just dont see it i dont see what in his policy will affect a reverse in this decline

5784520 weve heard that villages have been burned to the ground weve heard of reports of other scenes about some killings and some georgians who are hostages
5784521 we have forgotten or never focused on the ethic cleansing that took place in abkahzia and south ossetia in the early 1990s where a majority of the georgian population was simply driven out
5784522 any discussion of ethnic cleansing has to go back in time
5784523 the big issue that hasnt been mentioned here is osce
5784524 the idea of someone forcing his way with arms into your house killing members of the family and holding them hostage and then have the local police invite that same person to be the peacekeeper in the house to protect the house against further trouble is cynical beyond the normal range of imagination
5784525 yet that is exactly what osce did in assigning to russia the role of peacekeeper after the first war in georgia

5784645 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitry medvedev which is not happening at the moment
5784646 but the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation in the community of states
5784647 a very clear statement that nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe

5784689 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5784690 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5784691 it was so negligent so badly handled not only by the villagers but also by whatever agency was there that i will never go back to that place

5784698 third military people im sorry although i have seen few and when i say few i mean few military people that actually take thier pet with them so with that statistic its hard to say that if an extreme finacial situation came up or if you moved to africa that you would give away your pet which most people would sooooo with that said try to understand where we come from

5784700 i didnt believe in my wildest dreams that id be olympic champion

5784702 i have a sore shin so ill talk with my coach khalid boulami and well see
5784703 i saw ramzi coming in front of me and i had a plan of kicking past him in the last 200m but i couldnt
5784704 hes a great man losing to ramzi is a not a big deal
5784705 south korea showed in the first quarter what they are capable of and i thought we responded in the second and third quarter defensively in particular i thought we did a great job
5784706 once again i think our depth is key to our team and to our success we just can keep putting people on the floor and virtually have no letup at all so im really pleased were really excited to get into the semifinals
5784707 i know maybe only half the team was there when we lost in the world championship but thats enough
5784708 everybody else probably watched it on tv weve already watched film on that game a little that one game we lost but i think were a much better team now sometimes losses turn out to be the biggest win in a lot of ways because you learn more from them at times and they can really motivate you
5784709 for us russia is the team that beat us in the world championship so there is great motivation
5784710 in haining which was the warm up tournament we played russia it was becky hammons first day with that team in a game situation so i know theyre a lot better than they were but weve got confidence against that team i think we match up well with russia
5784711 lets hope so but i dont know honestly the teams were going to face next theyve been there done that russia beat us in the world championship australia weve played tough games we play with each other overseas they play in the wnba this is a very familiar group now everybody wants this so theres going to be some battles but were looking forward to it
5784712 yeah and no prior to this we had the diamond ball tournament and we had a close one against australia i think the way were playing were doing the things were supposed to be doing and i think were aware were going to get tested but its just a matter a fighting through it grind it out and just kind of staying the course a little bit theres going to be teams that are going to make runs and its going to be tight but hopefully we can withstand that and be able to keep ourselves on top
5784713 yeah i think so i think we can step it up a notch i still think we can clean things up i still think we can shoot the ball better especially from the outside but im really excited about how all 12 players are getting in there and we dont skip a beat
5784714 the situation in the region and saudi arabias political and financial support for the palestinian authority

5784724 why cant you little brats wait until she was ready
5784725 you had the chance to spend a lot of time with her the past couple days
5784726 there is too much love in this room come on mary i want to show you what i got while you were gone
5784727 ken has finally moved it into the ballroom where it belongs
5784728 no i cant not very well yet i have been practicing though
5784729 there are nights where there is nothing for us to do i am not summoned to hunt all the time on those nights i try and keep myself busy like my two tables i did not stop playing the piano until i became perfect
5784730 that is unless darien has something for me to do
5784731 just stop i dont want to hear anymore save it for when im out of the room
5784732 go show mary the piano she needs to work on getting her voice back anyways
5784733 come on mary ken is tuning the piano as we speak maybe i can get him to play one of the songs for you
5784734 just a couple more then it will be ready press those keys again for me helen
5784735 i thought i was just tuning the damn thing you never asked me to play im rusty you know why didnt you ask kami
5784736 i want you to close your eyes for me go ahead close them
5784737 now i want you to picture yourself being held captive
5784738 what if aliens are extra dementional cretures and one came in here right now and stole my cousin
5784739 what if every arab person coming over here is getting jobs in every department like food pharmacy and so on and then they just poison the world and take over that way
5784740 tendr n ganas de seguir ganando y eso le viene bien al equipo
5784741 you concentrate too hard on what you think you need to do
5784742 i am going to speak with darien why not go up to your room and get some rest when i am finished speaking with darien i will go hunt i know you must be parched you overworked yourself
5784743 mary kami has informed me that you were badly burned yesterday morning
5784744 you are not the first vampire to experience burns like that
5784745 there are several of our kind who have sensitive skin like you do however the more you are exposed to the sun the stronger your skin becomes the downfall to this is if you stay indoors for too long your skin becomes weak again what amazes me is your tears kami has informed me that they healed your burn the moment they came in contact with it
5784746 simply amazing now we know why you can still cry still stumped on why you still rest i wish my visions could show me such things
5784747 sorry i will hurry and get to that so you can feed
5784748 forgive me i am easily excited now i believe zenaku has found out the reason why your voice is so desirable
5784749 and that his powers have a terrible side effect for him there are several healers within his coven but they provide very little relief for his migraines if he found someone who could completely ease his suffering his power could become nearly unstoppable
5784750 we do not think there will be a complete cure for his side effect the only cure for that is if he loses his gift completely or is killed
5784751 although something tells me that is not all your voice will be capable of i am terribly excited to find out my theories are normally spot on
5784752 i believe your voice has the power to sooth harm or command your target your gift could be the greatest yet i do hope you get your voice back soon my visions have me so curious
5784753 anything could be possible this theory sounds more reasonable then the true mate nonsense
5784754 work hard for me mary i just had to express my thoughts with you please i can feel your thirst ken and i will leave you now in the morning the twins would like for you to see them they have been rather busy in the library in your absence

5784790 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement

5784817 we are delighted with the class leading performance of the sage s90i subwoofer
5784818 it transcends the previous limitations of in wall subwoofer designs and ideally complements our sage series planar magnetic loudspeaker systems finally there is a high end subwoofer solution for customers who desire fully integrated speaker systems with no compromise performance
5784819 we examined all types of transducer and cabinet loading options to determine a design that would complement the extraordinary dynamics and low distortion of our in wall planar magnetic systems
5784820 the regenerative line design proved to be our best option for ensuring a high performance no compromise low frequency solution when installed in a stud bay ceiling or floor
5784821 we are confident that dealers will recognize the unique solution offered by the s90i which complements not only sage series systems but any system in which the customer demands a fully integrated speaker solution including the subwoofer
5784822 previously in wall subwoofers presented a significant performance compromise when it came to offering a completely integrated in wall speaker system the s90i is a game changer which offers a level of performance that was not previously available we are thrilled to add this model to our sage lineup

5784909 i thought it was all over i quite literally thought she was going to kill me
5784910 i was trying to get up but i couldnt and then i saw my arm break as the hoof went through
5784911 there was no one around and i was calling out but i dont think anyone could have done anything anyway
5784912 if it had been a child or an elderly person they wouldnt have stood a chance i think generally it is safe but there are times when a cow can become on edge and thats when its dangerous
5784913 but this is an unfortunate incident and we are very sorry he has been injured
5784914 its very annoying but its part of the nature of the cows to protect their calves

5784917 i think the tournaments decided by easy baskets and americas the best
5784918 its hard to get a shot off its hard to get the ball across the half court line and they beat you down the floor and get lay ups
5784919 if you can get a shot up each time and get your defence set each time youve got a chance
5784920 no one that ive seen has been able to do that thats our challenge
5784921 they have learned the euro way and they are enormously talented there are no more advantages for euros to use against them
5784922 what was it that the japanese officer said after pearl harbour i think we just awoke the sleeping giant
5784923 well thats what europe has done with the united states and now theyre all about to go under a foot of the us again
5784924 we played against them four years ago and that was a completely different team then
5784925 their chemistry now is so good they defend i think theyre unbeatable
5784926 i mean you never know during 40 minutes of play what can happen but id be extremely surprised if they didnt win
5784927 i look at this as a team and them as individuals
5784928 australia plays a completely different style of game than we played against germany
5784929 they run a continuity offence and they are very proficient at it and they run hard cuts and set hard picks
5784930 they are real smart so it will be a different ball game
5784931 i expect them to play hard and tough they wont back down and will come ready to play
5784932 we have to keep doing what weve been doing the whole time run hard and play good defence
5784933 they are probably playing their best basketball at the moment

5784974 the best way to foster a relationship with your daughter is to abandon her at an early age and live the life of a cold blooded murderer when you are finally reunited with her a simple birthday gift will be enough to mend any feelings of estrangement or dislike the truly thoughtful dad will even go so far as to ask the love of her life to leave her for a life of undercover work
5784975 it is important not to casually say i love you to your partner save it for that moment when you get her pregnant and then leave her all alone fatherhood is enhanced by distance so never admit to your child that youre their parent instead watch over them from a distance maintaining a cool professional relationship at all times

5785055 i have every reason to believe there was more than one dancer at the party
5785056 and her friend were dancing at the manoogian mansion and that the mayors wife carlita kilpatrick threw a fit hit her and the other dancer then kicked them out of the house
5785057 the story about the second stripper is what got bowman demoted
5785058 the state police told him they were investigating the manoogian party and that they had information about a second dancer who danced there who had been murdered in the atlanta area
5785059 this woman supposedly was killed with a 40 caliber glock the same as tamara greene bowman asked permission to go to atlanta to check out what the state police told him and thats when he was taken off the case
5785060 if some girls were with her at this party greene wasnt the only dancer there right

5785330 in close places or in crowds panic can develop because movement is limited and there is no way of escape when our reaction to the presence of so many people increases our uneasiness animals that are cornered will panic timid creatures who normally run may become vicious under these conditions as the feeling to run changes into the feeling to fight after a while the very presence of people can cause discomfort irritation and even panic
5785331 you are probably not aware of the role hypnosis is playing in your own life but take a good look at your reactions under stress or in anticipation of a danger or pressure that is bigger than you are watch what happens the next time you know you must stand up to your boss or your childs teacher the very thought of it causes your heart to race and throws you into a panic there you are back in your hypnotic state the mere expectation of danger triggers a hypnotic condition that duplicates your response to the actual stress
5785332 the hypnotic state of mind takes a stronger grip on you with each succeeding stress because of the panic you feel as you struggle in vain to find answers on the mental level as a result you learn to lose awareness at the first sighting of stress and to start fumbling around in your imagination for ways of feeling superior and above it all ways that exist only in your head you know but you really dont know so you think you know and thats all that matters to you

5785380 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5785381 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5785382 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5785383 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5785384 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5785385 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5785386 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5785387 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5785388 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5785389 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5785390 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5785391 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5785392 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5785393 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5785516 three years ago i started a project depicts the disappearance of the old swimming pools and baths in uk in the thirties united kingdom s baths and outdoors pools were at the peak of their popularity gradually tastes and necessities have changed resulting in a drop in attendances leaving the pools uneconomical to run many fell into decay and many were demolished only a handful of pools remain today as a symbol of a bygone era

5785522 people dont realize when were not working together we hang out together we go on vacations together
5785523 i just moved just got an apartment in beverly hills im so excited
5785524 were growing up and we all have such huge dreams we want to fulfil but i would be on board to do a fourth movie definitely
5785525 honestly we totally did but one of the biggest messages we have is you support your friends whatever they want to do
5785526 i remember kiely and i would talk and at the end of the first movie we were just crying
5785527 you make a movie with some people you become friends over the process of making this movie and then you go your own way
5785528 even by disney channel standards this sequel is weak and shrill and not at all fun
5785529 its a neat sound familiar and ancient yet new and exotic i like that
5785530 you dont even have to admit that you were ever pregnant
5785531 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave
5785532 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying a greater part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at any level
5785533 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitry medvedev which is not happening at the moment
5785534 but the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation in the community of states
5785535 a very clear statement that nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5785536 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5785537 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5785538 we remain concerned by russias actions during this crisis and remind russia of its responsibility for maintaining security and order in the areas where it exercises control especially in light of continuing reports of russias deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure
5785539 there is the great and continuing challenge represented by the threat to democracy in fiji
5785540 it would have been far better for the leader of fiji to sit down with the leaders of the pacific island countries
5785541 i will be compelled to tell the people of my country that they must now be prepared to suffer more sanctions and international isolation as we pursue a better more durable democracy
5785542 if there is a frank bainimarama on board please press the call button if you are here frank please raise your

5785544 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
5785545 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
5785546 companies need to do more than talk about green initiatives
5785547 it takes more than high profile ads to make it happen employees need to see that their company is serious about it that means concrete actions such as in house programs for saving energy and recycling
5785548 reducing startup waste should be a top priority for environmentally minded printers its the one area with the largest impact on a presss environmental performance
5785549 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5785550 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5785551 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5785552 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5785553 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5785554 you can take melkys name and exchange it with a lot of guys on this field right now that are making a hell of a lot more money than melky cabrera
5785555 theyre better than what they have showed too but in this case melky had options and i have a guy who is pushing his way into the mix in brett gardner so in melkys case i had a choice i could make
5785556 in the other guys cases we can just keep running their names in the lineup keep making sure they go through the processes they should and hope for better results
5785557 he has struggled for an extended period of time and placed his spot in jeopardy to have to be sent down and someone else behind the scenes brett gardner has pushed himself into the conversation its hard to look at the future right now because i am looking so hard right now at 08
5785558 id like to have one more chance without a doubt
5785559 it really would have to be the right place and the team that did it would have to believe i wouldnt walk away
5785560 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5785561 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5785562 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5785563 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5785564 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5785565 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5785566 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5785567 who are open to doing something on the production side
5785568 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5785569 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5785570 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5785571 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5785572 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5785573 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5785574 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5785575 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5785576 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5785577 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5785578 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5785579 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5785580 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5785581 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5785582 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5785583 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5785584 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5785585 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5785586 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5785587 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5785588 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5785589 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5785590 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5785591 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5785592 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5785593 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5785594 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5785595 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5785596 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5785597 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5785598 our goal is to make people care about something thats the hard part if they care theyll go learn the specifics its not about how it works its about developing an interest
5785599 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5785600 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5785601 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5785602 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5785603 we developed the program to address the deficits that we see in females especially weakness in the lateral hip muscles the glutes and the core muscles
5785604 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5785605 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5785606 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5785607 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5785608 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5785609 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5785610 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5785611 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5785612 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5785613 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5785614 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5785615 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5785616 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5785617 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5785618 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5785619 we really want to get the message out to people
5785620 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5785621 who is supposed to be more on top of financial things than a bank but banks made all these terrible mortgage loans and caused these disruptions and we are dependent on them for our financial security
5785622 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5785623 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5785624 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5785625 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5785626 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5785627 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5785628 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5785629 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5785630 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5785631 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5785632 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5785633 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5785634 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5785635 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5785636 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5785637 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5785638 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5785639 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5785640 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5785641 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5785642 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5785643 while pheaas mission remains beyond reproach the agency has lost its focus
5785644 many of pheaas leaders seem to have put their self interest ahead of the needs of pennsylvania students

5785650 i visited mike right before camp and i had a chance to sit down with him and talk with him about a lot of things dealing with life
5785651 i tried not talk too much about football but just whats going to happen when he gets out eventually and just being there in support of him as ive been this is a situation where i could go and sit down with a guy and not have to worry about telling the world
5785652 i just let him know im there for him whenever he gets out
5785653 i just want everything in his life to be in order when he gets out hes got an uphill battle hes certainly talented enough to play in the national football league as a quarterback somebody will take him but i think hes got a lot more things to focus on his inner circle the people around him so that he can be a better person when he gets out of this whole ordeal
5785654 i understand another rumor is flying out there last week it was quarterback john beck this week its ronnie there was no discussion of that internally or externally none
5785655 and right now ronnies not out there hes dealing with a thumb and rickys out there and thats the way we go
5785656 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5785657 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5785658 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5785659 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5785660 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5785661 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5785662 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5785663 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5785664 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5785665 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5785666 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5785667 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5785668 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5785669 launching our solutions will create a trusted environment for individuals to balance their desire for privacy with respect to their health information with the desire to share information when sharing information can improve their medical care and the care of others
5785670 creating solutions that will overcome obstacles that currently slow the medical communitys ability to more quickly and more cost effectively find causes and treatments for chronic illnesses and diseases is all the inspiration i needed to join private access and ensure its success i am honored to have the opportunity to lead private access
5785671 over the next six months we are laser focused on product development aligning with strategic partners and securing additional capital for the company
5785672 we are very pleased to be completing our initial research and development period and entering the next stage of our growth where we will go to market with the first technologically seamless application that harmonizes privacy and access
5785673 marcs breadth and depth of experience in strategy and operations within technology and information companies will assure a successful launch and accelerate our growth with his guidance we are pursuing our next round of funding from a combination of non profit strategic and private sources we are fortunate to have such a dynamic and experienced leader on board at this critical time
5785674 private access is clearly ready to enter a new chapter which comes at a time when the broader market is demanding privacy solutions
5785675 the opportunity to introduce the company at the harvard conference coupled with the addition of an accomplished president in marc will position private access as an industry pioneer poised to address the critical obstacle facing medical researchers and disease advocacy organizations in order to significantly accelerate their ability to find causes and treatments for diseases and chronic illnesses
5785676 exploding transport costs may soon remove the single most important brake on inflation over the last decade wage arbitrage with china
5785677 not that chinese manufacturing wages wont still warrant arbitrage but in todays world of triple digit oil prices distance costs money
5785678 unless that container is chock full of diamonds its shipping costs have suddenly inflated the cost of whatever is inside
5785679 and those inflated costs get passed onto the consumer price index when you buy that good at your local retailer as oil prices keep rising pretty soon those transport costs start cancelling out the east asian wage advantage
5785680 higher energy prices are impacting transport costs at an unprecedented rate so much so that the cost of moving goods not the cost of tariffs is the largest barrier to global trade today
5785681 thats great news if you are the united steelworkers of america
5785682 long lost jobs will soon be coming home and the more that oil and transport costs rise for chinese steel exporters the more that north american steel wage rates can grow but if youre a steel buyer your costs are going up regardless of whether youre sourcing from china or pittsburgh
5785683 we are back at tariff rates even prior to the kennedy round gatt negotiations of the mid 1960s
5785684 even at us 100 per barrel of oil transport costs outweigh the impact of tariffs for all of americas trading partners including canada and mexico
5785685 its relatively easy to see why north american importers shifted to regional trading during that time
5785686 trans oceanic transport costs literally exploded during the two oil price shocks the cost of shipping a standard cargo load overseas almost tripled just as it has over the past few years ultimately soaring transport costs were borne by consumers and markets responded accordingly substituting goods that could be sourced from closer locations than half way around the world carrying hugely inflated freight costs
5785687 freight sensitive chinese exports to the u s now account for 42 per cent of total exports down from 52 per cent in 2004
5785688 that if it were not for the dramatic increase in transport costs growth in chinese exports to the u s since 2004 would have been 35 per cent stronger than the actual tally
5785689 certainly no reason why we should not expect to see at least comparable if not greater trade diversification
5785690 instead of finding cheap labour half way around the world the key will be to find the cheapest labour force within reasonable shipping distance to your market
5785691 to put things in perspective todays extra shipping cost from east asia is the equivalent of imposing a nine per cent tariff on east asian goods entering north america and at oil prices at us 200 per barrel the tariff equivalent rate will rise to 15 per cent
5785692 in a world of triple digit oil prices distance costs money and while trade liberalization and technology may have flattened the world rising transport prices will once again make it rounder
5785693 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
5785694 general kony should have signed the peace agreement a few months ago
5785695 as you know the negotiations were completed and all that has been remaining is for joseph kony to sign
5785696 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5785697 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5785698 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5785699 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5785704 een interne vrt beslissing het management van vrt sport en de directie geloven in tom coninx vinden hem een uitstekend presentator en dit zowel op radio als op televisie
5785705 tom zal vanaf de volgende weken zijn werk als presentator en journalist gewoon weer opnemen zoals gepland
5785706 er is nooit enige twijfel geweest dat coninx een uitstekend presentator is
5785707 ive been wanting to do this my whole life and now my dream came true
5785708 its critical however that you find out how to tell this installation procedure that its supposed to stuff all its nifty files not into your but into startdir pkg instead
5785709 that increased use of nuclear an outright competitor to coal as a deliverer of baseload power is essential to combat climate change
5785710 it could generate power by burning up nuclear waste leaving only short lived by products unfit for nuclear bombs thus could cancel out concerns about nuclear proliferation
5785711 there are no grounds for saying that a fourth generation of nuclear power would prevent proliferation there are three generations at present the third generation is the one being constructed in finland and another in france it is the type the government wants to build in england
5785712 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave
5785713 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying a greater part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at any level
5785714 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitry medvedev which is not happening at the moment
5785715 but the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation in the community of states
5785716 a very clear statement that nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5785717 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5785718 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5785719 we remain concerned by russias actions during this crisis and remind russia of its responsibility for maintaining security and order in the areas where it exercises control especially in light of continuing reports of russias deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure
5785720 the declaration above all appears unobjective and biased because theres not a word about how all this started why it happened who started the aggressive action and who armed georgia
5785721 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave

5785738 we won because we were solid and the chinese team have shown that for a long time
5785739 to be a top team and win medals you dont just have to go from 10th place to the semi finals
5785740 you have to reach the top four consistently if a team pops up in the top four and then disappears its not enough your programme has to have longevity
5785741 china has to be in the top four in the next olympics and then in the next thats the test

5785753 this is what they will continue to do against nigeria in the final nigeria is a really strong team we want to savour this win over brazil first
5785754 of course this will put more pressure and there will be some doubts about me as the coach and the team but i have faith in my work and in my players
5785755 we will evaluate this defeat and look into the problem areas and we will study everything this is what happens in football sometimes you win sometimes you lose but the most important thing is we have to put our heart into it
5785756 they killed innocent defenceless civilians people are traumatised we need food medicines we want the soldiers here
5785757 i compare this the talks to a shattered glass it would be very difficult to put the pieces together

5785768 they have high world rankings so they will be difficult
5785769 but that is not the most important thing this is the olympics and nobody knows who will get a medal it will be who is most confident in competition time and who is more focused
5785770 its generally accepted that london is the divorce capital of the world

5785794 so much of todays market is driven by distress unless interpreted in that context the stats give a rather distorted view of the overall market we know one third of the bay areas resales in july were homes fresh off foreclosure who knows how many more involved a desperate seller and a lender who accepted a short sale
5785795 meanwhile many would be sellers wait for a healthier market and many would be buyers especially those eyeing costlier coastal homes wait for signs of a market bottom or for the return of more favorable financing a clearer picture of the entire housing market will emerge once more of these foreclosures burn off and more lenders sellers and buyers get off the sidelines and back into the housing game
5785796 this new multi year agreement is a testament to the strength of our state of the art ceramics portfolio
5785797 we look forward to continuing to foster our relationship with these world class partners in defense of our country

5785800 we were thrilled with the niche he was trying to fill
5785801 i supported the school through the company and through my own personal finances to keep it going
5785802 the public carriage office continues to receive a significant number of complaints that licensed taxi drivers are causing a nuisance by urinating in the street particularly in the marylebone and bayswater areas
5785803 this behaviour is not only unpleasant and offensive but is also a criminal offence within the city of westminster it is also contrary to section 5 of the good rule and government no 2 byelaw any complaints of urinating in the street will be passed to the police and will be subject to investigation
5785804 this would be a softball interview and the show is 8th or 9th in the nation
5785805 i hope you are getting a cut of babbins action as his agent
5785806 im subbing for hugh hewitt again tomorrow and want to bash the un report
5785807 i asked for u s army major general jay hood and got the answer that the military isnt going out on that now can you do it please call asap
5785808 he is going to be on the cnbc show kudlow amp company tonight and want al qaeda threat to saudi oil fields anything we could share with him
5785809 we are getting jed a one pager on the status of forces in the korean peninsula the message being we still have a massive deterrent there for north korea we will also put him into touch with state for talking points on the 6 party talks
5785810 i have information thats given to me by sources of all sorts private information is what you normally do in washington you get confidential sources and you rely on them im not compromised i cant speak for anybody else other than myself but i have no relationship with defense contractors i have no contracts with the pentagon theres no conflict there
5785811 when you hire a former general as a media commentator youre hiring him for his expertise and his ability to independently analyze whats going on
5785812 if youre assuming because hes retired he has a measure of independence and then you find out no hes actually been to all these trainings where hes received talking points thats a problem you have promised your audience that youre going to deliver them independent analysis not a mouthpiece for the pentagon
5785813 the journalists had the obligation to figure out if their sources were independent
5785814 each show decided how they were going to use these people and at that point somebody shouldve been having a conversation about what theyre bringing to the product and how that works and then finally there should be an overall standard that says when we hire people here is what we should ask of them
5785815 everyone i wrote for and so forth knew i was talking to people in the pentagon
5785816 im not sure if jed mentioned he was a part of the department of defenses military analyst program he might at some point he said over the years though that hes been part of many many briefings at the pentagon most when he was actually working there under bush 41
5785817 jed babbin is the editor of human events he wrote for national review he wrote for american spectator hes conservative
5785818 were a conservative talk show mr babbins been on our show many many times over the years and he comes from a conservative background he was privy to a number of briefings we took advantage of hearing what was in those briefings
5785819 if they were buying my loyalty they got a pretty bad bargain if they thought they were buying my reporting they really had a very poor investment look at my stories look at what ive written ive been very highly critical at times of the president and a lot of the people who conduct the war
5785820 we really should try to help babbin secure guests for his radio hosting gigs he is consistently solid and helpful
5785821 im sure all your folks are familiar with the tremendous support weve received from jed
5785822 i have lined up the support of most of them but also wanted to highlight the secretarys role in having started these gatherings
5785823 you see the clinton crowd simply ignored us and hoped we would just go away you guys deserve credit for having had the smarts to invite us into the fold with all the hell that gets raised in washington about government cover ups and concealments its actually refreshing that somebody thought to inform some rather knowledgeable observers about what was really going on
5785824 i know ken quite well and i dont know why he gave it that characterization
5785825 i asked a lot of tough questions and sometimes got answers that were satisfactory and some that werent
5785826 the briefings and all other interactions with the military analysts had been suspended indefinitely pending an internal review
5785827 but obviously i talk to a lot of people in this town
5785828 i was driving on i95 between baltimore and washington dc on tuesday and saw this its supposed to say 1 800 go penske
5785829 it was my first move as the coach i knew the kid and what hed been through since he was 13 14 years old it was going to be his team at some point down the road anyway and i thought he was ready to start handling the responsibility
5785830 the impending impact of mems microelectromechanical systems will be both exciting and far ranging
5785831 it would be great i really wanted to stand again for the ioc because i really enjoy that work and i feel i can make a difference because ive had a quite a lot of experience after five olympics
5785832 i knew about a year ago that id put myself up for election again
5785833 the chances of getting elected are pretty small because youve got huge numbers from european countries and new zealands so small
5785834 were quite a small sport and sailors really arent that interested in that sort of stuff but its very big in europe and asia the chances of getting voted on are actually quite slim
5785835 we can tell athletes it is an important mechanism and they should vote but not who they should vote for we dont have an ioc member so it is important to have someone at that level
5785836 we were prepared we had what we thought was a pretty sound game plan but they played pretty well
5785837 we tried to put pressure on them but they were pretty good at getting out of it whereas with other teams we can put them under pressure then quite comfortably and create mistakes germany seem to be quite good at getting out of it
5785838 in the warm up and before the match i felt everyone was very relaxed
5785839 its a whole other mindset when you are playing quarterback
5785840 you know where you are supposed to be and timing of the routes but when you are running the routes blocking and things like that its different i think its a little easier to play quarterback

5785842 within the last few hours ive spoken with two of the finalists for the role of barack obamas running mate and to two other sources who are close to the process

5785844 these shows they say are auditions for the big job and if that s the case we re looking at evan bayh tim kaine and georgia president mikheil saakashvili

5785872 foreclosure every day dumps tens of thousands of homes on the market and thats very hard to compete with
5785873 the big question is whether the deal congress made reduces foreclosures
5785874 i can just tell from trading its not a good environment out there
5785875 it just doesnt feel right it feels like its going lower
5785876 i think were stuck in a downward channel for a couple years
5785877 this process of deleveraging thats occurring is a very significant headwind for the economy its going to take a while for the banks to right themselves

5785884 in europe awareness and uptake are still lower overall although in the key markets the retailers and the studios are reacting to an uplift in interest this year and are gearing up for a good end to 2008
5785885 all eyes are on warners initiative to cut catalogue prices
5785886 other studios and the retailers are going to be watching consumer reaction to this very carefully
5785887 much of the drive behind this increase is coming from growing consumer awareness and falling hardware prices coupled with ps3 owners increasingly using their consoles for video playback
5785888 i would be amazed if we dont see a blu ray player in the u s at or below 250 by the end of this year and in order to stimulate consumer traffic in the holiday season whos to say there wont be a product at closer to 200

5785939 its great news for the free speech rights for these students
5785940 although its extremely unfortunate that the students were not allowed to give their talk at defcon
5785941 it was definitely unfair to use that statute to silence the students
5785942 we certainly hope the next time that people are allowed to present their important research instead of being silenced by bogus lawsuits
5785943 were glad the court actually saw things as they should be
5785944 all the material we were going to talk about has been made public and more
5785945 despite whats happened and the animosity the mbta has brought toward us
5785946 i cant really comment on the actual means that we used
5785947 its probably not a good idea to comment on that we certainly did not get free fare we had to spend several hundred dollars on buying tickets to look at the data structure far more than we ever would have used
5785948 went over the entire universe of our knowledge of the system even more than the class paper has
5785949 the times are too serious for this kind of politics

5785963 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5785964 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up

5785979 now for the first time we have the chance of independent assessment
5785980 we have no confidence in these international observers in these people who corrupt the truth
5785981 the key now is to have the monitors in there and then well see how we can solve the situation in the long term

5785987 but three times medvedev has said they are starting the withdrawal and they have not we cannot accept this kind of blindness not accepting international law and their own words
5785988 we need firmness not threats we must not threaten them because it will not work because everyone knows we are not going to war
5785989 the red line for us is russia maintaining an occupation of georgia
5785990 medvedev was not apologetic at all but very clear very frank
5785991 youre a new leader youre very young you must not be attacked as a liar you have to fulfill your promises and if you give us your word you must respect that
5785992 we are not back to a cold war and i dont want this language to come back
5785993 its not true both russia and georgia came out of the soviet union and are moving toward democracy in their own ways
5785994 i dont want to consider the relationship with russia like a confrontation block against block
5785995 this is a great country coming back to the first rank in the concert of nations and they want to play as they used to play as a great country
5785996 russian military action has been disproportionate and inconsistent with its peacekeeping role
5785997 to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave
5785998 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5785999 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5786000 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor and whitewash a criminal regime save a collapsing regime and is taking a path to the rearmament of the current leaders in georgia
5786001 ensure russia does not learn the wrong lessons from the events of the last two weeks
5786002 force cannot be the basis for the demarcation of new lines around russia
5786003 whatever the outcome russia has all but obliterated georgias possibility of joining nato as it cannot belong to this alliance if it has unresolved border disputes
5786004 generally its a pretty unfriendly environment for anything thats not a treasury note
5786005 but in terms of the ultimate credit worthiness of agencies and their ability and willingness to pay off on all their debt obligations that position is stronger now than it was a year ago
5786006 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5786007 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5786008 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
5786009 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
5786010 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area
5786011 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
5786012 a very powerful flashlight directed at the moon would theoretically create a bright spot on its surface by simply turning the flashlight sideways the flashlights beam streaks across the sky at speeds far exceeding the speed of light this evidence has long been known and dismissed since the bright spot cannot be used for superluminal or faster than light communication between the earth and the moon the fast motion of the bright spot is simply a geometrical artifact similar in some ways to the point at which the two blades of closing scissors intersect the theory of relativity does not concern such purely geometrical objects
5786013 it is the spectacle of people who might be different thats all it is

5786020 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5786021 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5786022 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5786023 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5786024 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5786025 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5786026 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5786027 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5786028 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5786029 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5786030 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5786031 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5786032 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5786033 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5786034 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5786035 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter
5786036 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5786037 its a whole other mindset when you are playing quarterback

5786080 yes there is an ignorance which no one needs be troubled over if he was deprived either of the opportunity or the capacity to learn but there is an ignorance about ones own life that is equally tragic for the learned and for the simple for both are bound by the same responsibility this ignorance is called self deceit
5786081 even if honor were unanimous it would still be meaningless and the more so the more thousands that create the unanimity and the greater the multitude that created unanimity the sooner will it show itself to be meaningless and indeed it was this unanimity of the thousands that he desired it was not the approbation of the good men whoever therefore wills this honor or fears this contempt of the thousands whether or not he is said to will one thing in his innermost being is not merely double minded but thousand minded and at variance with himself so is his life when he must grovel in order to attain honor when he must flatter his enemies in order to attain honor when he must woo the favor of those he despises in order to attain honor when he must betray the one whom he respects in order to attain honor for to attain honor means to despise oneself after one has attained the pinnacle of honor and yet to tremble before any change

5786192 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave
5786193 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying a greater part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at any level
5786194 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitry medvedev which is not happening at the moment
5786195 but the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation in the community of states
5786196 a very clear statement that nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5786197 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5786198 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5786199 we remain concerned by russias actions during this crisis and remind russia of its responsibility for maintaining security and order in the areas where it exercises control especially in light of continuing reports of russias deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure
5786200 the declaration above all appears unobjective and biased because theres not a word about how all this started why it happened who started the aggressive action and who armed georgia
5786201 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave
5786202 our analysis of the jupiter data finds that consumers are more likely to act on the ads they see on local tv newspaper and magazine sites

5786211 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
5786212 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
5786213 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
5786214 as you can see ice has grown in nearly every direction since last summer with a large increase in the area north of siberia also note that the area around the northwest passage west of greenland has seen a significant increase in ice some of the islands in the canadian archipelago are surrounded by more ice than they were during the summer of 1980
5786215 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

5786218 we learned that even though we were using the same molecule all were composed of molybdenum and sulfur size and structure is important in determining reactivity
5786219 the most reactive nanocluster of those that we tested had six atoms of molybdenum and eight atoms of sulfur it readily absorbed sulfur and let go of carbon monoxide which makes it an effective catalyst
5786220 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5786221 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5786222 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5786223 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5786224 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions

5786228 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment and unfair to hardworking americans who pay their fair share of taxes we need to plug these tax loopholes and put these corporations back on the tax rolls
5786229 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
5786230 this report makes clear that too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
5786231 when two thirds of corporations pay no taxes pelosi intoned
5786232 in other words there was virtually no news in the gao study but that didnt stop the democrats democratic politicians misused and misrepresented the results of this modest gao study to bash americas corporations and call for sweeping reforms if they will do so in response to this minor document one can only conclude that they will do so on the flimsiest of excuses leaders of the democratic party are so eager to portray american business as villainous that they will twist and distort facts in order justify even more punitive taxes than we already have

5786347 de gunstige effecten kunnen wel een week of langer aanhouden
5786348 het is het ultieme bewijs dat iemand naar je verlangt dat iemand je wilt en je waardeert en als je je sexy voelt dan zie je er meestal ook zo uit
5786349 het is niet zo dat we alle problemen kunnen oplossen met tussen de lakens duiken

5786372 interior included laminated oak trim that is the best wood accent ever seen on a car like weathered teak from a boat carved grain outlining the ultra slim center stack and console with a few wooden touches throughout the cabin
5786373 legendary italian design studio pininfarina collaborated on the design of the volvo c70
5786374 a little more horsepower would turn the c70 from a satisfying ride to a thrilling one
5786375 its a little less speedy here however given the added weight of the c70s complex top mechanism
5786376 certainly not blistering the turbocharged engine provides enough low end torque to get the c70 moving briskly enough from a stop
5786377 mates with a six speed manual or a five speed automatic transmission with winter and manual shifting modes
5786378 automatic transmission is smooth and alert the manuals shift action is a bit rubbery but shifts are smooth and clean overall
5786379 does a more than creditable job of finding the right balance between ride and handling for most luxury coupe convertible drivers
5786380 the c70 volvo had a tendency to wallow and pogo
5786381 a function of spring and damper rates selected for boulevard ride quality
5786382 not sports car nimble but c70 corners with front drive assurance modest body lean and tolerable noseplow
5786383 volvos have long been known for their fantastic seat comfort and the c70 upholds that reputation
5786384 quiet in most operating modes including speeds over 70 mph
5786385 well built blend of top down fun and fixed roof security
5786386 the volvo c70 seats four adults and features ergonomically shaped front seats
5786387 adult size room on comfortable supportive seats many seat and steering wheel adjustments make it easy to find a comfortable driving stance
5786388 the rear seat is a token gesture shaped for two only scant legroom even with the front seats forward makes it very tight for most adults and many teens
5786389 beautifully crafted leather seats that hold you in place snugly but dont try to squeeze you like a grandmother heading back to alaska for a year
5786390 volvos have long been known for their fantastic seat comfort and the c70 upholds that reputation
5786391 objects can be stored in the trunk by opening a pass thru between the two rear seating positions
5786392 lowering the top cuts ample trunk space in half though a couple golf bags or medium suitcases still fit the door map pockets barely hold standard gas station maps
5786393 the c70 can be a quiet cozy closed coupe in a rain shower and a wide open convertible in the sun at the touch of a button
5786394 the c70 volvo cabin is solidly assembled with high quality materials
5786395 when raised the hard top is better at blocking noise and the elements
5786396 theres little top down wind buffeting road roar is always audible with the 18 inch tires but isnt overbearing
5786397 is quiet enough at cruise but fairly loud at full throttle
5786398 because the c70s roof can disappear volvo mounted the head curtain airbags in the door and made them deploy upward
5786399 new for 2008 are a tire pressure monitoring system and emergency brake lights which are taillights that illuminate brighter under hard braking such as when the antilock brakes activate
5786400 available in only one trim level t5 the c70 comes well equipped with most modern convenience features
5786401 green day or sinatra music has rarely sounded as pure and clear as through the c70s audiophile worthy system
5786402 includes 12 speakers dolby surround sound two subwoofers and five amplifiers
5786403 integrated global positioning system gps unit heated front seats leather or ultra premium sovereign hide leather seats and polished 18 inch performance rubber wrapped tires
5786404 the crossfires styling is a blend of edges and subtle curves a center spine runs the full length of the coupe and serves as a dominant design feature a tapered boat tail shape highlights the rear end which emphasizes the large rear wheels tires and fender
5786405 theres still nothing else on the road that looks like the crossfire
5786406 only two occupants fit inside the crossfires twin cockpit interior a metallic center console flows from the top of the instrument panel through the center of the car
5786407 the steering wheel is a rich looking piece with accents of aluminum echoed in the columns stalks
5786408 the crossfires interior is pleasing enough to the eye what with its two tone color scheme and abundant metallic trim
5786409 the switch gear works flawlessly the surfaces are attractive and the silver trim brightens things up
5786410 you wonder who stole all the fun from a car that looks this good
5786411 not surprisingly the crossfire runs like a 2008 chrysler crossfire doesnt quite have the performance to match its quasi exotic looks
5786412 peak torque comes on stream at 3000 rpm which helps make the crossfire sports car quick at low speeds but open it up on the highway and the rush doesnt continue with the same urgency
5786413 the crossfire is capable of going from zero to 60 in the high 6 second range when equipped with the manual transmission figure a few 10ths more for the five speed auto
5786414 either a six speed manual gearbox or an adaptive autostick five speed automatic transmission can be installed
5786415 quick passing response requires a pronounced stab at the throttle to coax a down shift from the otherwise smooth working transmission
5786416 can be manually up and downshifted without first moving the selector out of drive we would like to see steering wheel mounted shift paddles however
5786417 stubby shift lever promises short slick shifts but doesnt really deliver
5786418 epa fuel economy estimates are 15 mpg city 23 highway for manual equipped crossfires and 19 25 for models with the automatic
5786419 well weighted steering provides good feedback and crisp turn in
5786420 the ultrawide tires provide so much grip even the all season continentals that even with the stability control switched off its hard to find their limit
5786421 cant hope to match the feel of the best sports cars
5786422 aside from its tenacious grip and decently comfortable highway ride the crossfire doesnt have much to offer when compared to the newer dynamically superior models available at its price point
5786423 only two occupants fit inside the crossfires twin cockpit interior
5786424 a rear bulkhead prevents the seats from reclining when they are fully retracted
5786425 youre cocooned inside with a high beltline rising toward the rear a sloping roof and a pinched view out the back
5786426 the center console is fairly large but the cabin is wide enough not to feel confining tall drivers who need to push the seat far back may find the headliner too close however
5786427 a high bulkhead immediately aft of the front seats precludes tossing anything behind them and theres only 7 6 cubic feet of cargo space under the rear hatch
5786428 however that trim is really just silver painted plastic for the most part and theres no dressing up that old mercedes stereos undersized buttons and mediocre sound quality
5786429 the switch gear works flawlessly the surfaces are attractive and the silver trim brightens things up
5786430 more so in the 2008 chrysler crossfire is a tight squeeze for adults and their stuff and the metallic trim inside is just a brilliant disguise 8 out of 10 nhtsa five stars side impacts coupe five stars rollover resistance chrysler updated the cars airbags for 2007
5786431 enters 2008 with a tire pressure monitoring system as standard equipment
5786432 a plug in air compressor and a can of tire sealant are provided instead
5786433 gigantic blind spots that come along with the crossfires boattail rear styling
5786434 only the limited trim level is offered for 2008 as the base models have been dropped
5786435 standard with 18 inch wheels in front and 19s out back dual zone manual air conditioning an eight speaker 240 watt stereo system power adjustable leather seats with heaters leather wrapped steering wheel full power accessories
5786436 a power top with a glass rear window and defroster
5786437 outclassed when it comes to refined luxury and engaging performance
5786438 with the current car dating back to 1998 an all new 9 5 is long past due
5786439 the new front end styling features projector style headlamps set in a unique matte black housing
5786440 nose and tail fail to hide its long in the tooth styling and the doors and tumblehome remain unchanged and are showing their wrinkles
5786441 the 9 5 underwent a significant freshening that included an exterior face lift
5786442 theres just no escaping the fact that its still partying er driving like its 1999
5786443 purists who shun the overly high tech approach and flashy styling so pervasive in todays luxury saab
5786444 responsive nimble and downright quick benefiting from a turbocharger that delivers its influence politely but firmly
5786445 choppy ride quality on uneven pavement and unrefined power delivery from its turbocharged 2 3 liter engine
5786446 the 9 5 is sufficiently quick although the power delivery is not as refined as wed like
5786447 torque steer remains an issue under hard acceleration due to its front wheel drive layout
5786448 four cylinder must compete with sixes and v 8s in this class
5786449 many vehicles in this class offer six speed versions of both types of transmission
5786450 the saab 9 5 is responsive nimble and downright quick
5786451 has the disadvantage of being a front drive sedan in a rear and or all wheel drive class
5786452 passengers will appreciate that front and rear heated seats are included as standard equipment
5786453 ample passenger room and exceptionally comfortable seats especially when equipped with the ventilation feature
5786454 plenty of room for four tall adults who sit upright in the quiet upscale interior
5786455 in both the sedan and sportcombi upright chairlike seating permits comfortable posture and leather upholstered seats are standard
5786456 most drivers will find the saab seats exceptionally comfortable especially those equipped with optional heating and ventilation
5786457 a reasonable choice for family use or as an suv alternative given its sizable cargo capacity
5786458 in addition wind and road noise levels are higher than they should be in an entry level sedan and wagon
5786459 tire pressure monitoring system daytime running lights and theft deterrent system with engine immobilizer
5786460 impressive number of features but it pales in comparison against much newer competitors
5786461 heated leather seats dual zone automatic climate control and harman kardon sound
5786462 the once convoluted button happy radio and climate controls have since been replaced by straightforward gm sourced units
5786463 a visibility option package includes xenon headlamps power folding and auto dimming side mirrors and rear park assist
5786464 they have been talking to her about how she would like it handled she was told they wouldnt broadcast anything that she was not happy with
5786465 but jade said lets just deal with this head on there are going to be lots of questions and so on the conversation she had with her doctor was entirely private and not recorded
5786466 jade came out from that and said to her housemates what she had been told everyone was pretty shocked she was extremely upset it was clear from that point that she had to leave
5786467 steep decline in oil production brings risk of war and unrest says new study
5786468 i realized that its ok not to want to do something
5786469 i have second and third thoughts and overanalyze nearly everything
5786470 so while things are not exactly perfect right now life is ok
5786471 years ago i used to think id never be happy
5786472 im still struggling with the idea of who i am and where im headed
5786473 i try not to obsess too much about the future just trying to enjoy the moments
5786474 i long for the chance to push the reset on my own life
5786475 i like to think in another life i own a small cozy cafe in the mountains somewhere
5786476 i feel like i am so many things and so few
5786477 we continue to find that the guam public school system employees and staff and superintendent are working very hard to solve these problems we give them high marks for cooperation and effort but we continue to be concerned about the continuity of that effort
5786478 i think the mindset of the current and existing board is that theyre the boss they are in charge of the superintendent and they will hire and fire as they see fit its a style of management that maybe is particular to this chairman its management by threat and it does not sit well with u s doe
5786479 the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5786480 this is a genuinely transformational deal which makes lonely planet readily available regardless of time or place
5786481 we dont see much change in the forces that were there
5786482 the russian forces do not appear to be withdrawing in large numbers out of georgia
5786483 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5786484 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5786485 kids are going to drink whether its legal or illegal
5786486 wed at least be able to have a more open dialogue with students about drinking as opposed to this sham where people dont want to talk about it because its a violation of the law
5786487 i think alcohol is seen a lot of times as a forbidden thing and people want it
5786488 its almost like contraband once you get it you have to drink all of it
5786489 maybe im being idealistic but in europe you can drink once you can see the bar
5786490 i think we should maybe take a lesson from what other countries are doing
5786491 making sense of the market investors who know where to look can find opportunities
5786492 the current climate does not point to long term fundamental value declines because the analysis of supply and demand indicates balance in most markets and sectors
5786493 so the situation represents good investment opportunities in 2008 and 2009 for those investors who arent waiting for the pack to tell them where to look

5786497 the rifle certainly has a modern appearance the receiver area is a bit hard to describe but is a near gloss black and slick looking finish over some sort of very lightweight alloy the stainless steel barrel is matte finished and outwardly looks much like any other stainless muzzy barrel the two piece stock on my sample is a plain black synthetic with what appear to be permanently affixed inserts to provide grip at both sides of the forearm and pistol grip without destroying them it would be hard to say just how those inserts if they are inserts rather than appliqu s are installed they are reasonably attractive in a grayish color that has a leathery grain and rubbery feel the stock should be easy to grip even in wet weather the buttstock is hollow and will benefit greatly from a stuffing of packing foam it wears a rubber recoil pad that is somewhat poorly fitted but should be at least functional the rifle weighs 7 pounds 3 ounces on my ofishul dfk scales actually fish scales the barrel has decent sights attached fiber optic front that is superior to the one provided on whites in that it has 3 metal retaining bands around the brittle red fiber stick should be much more resistant to breakage and is very comparable to the fronts used on some tc rifles it appears to be a single unit rather than ramp and insert that is held in place by a single unhidden screw the rear sight is an abbreviated ramp which would not appear to offer a great deal of adjustment but if of proper height would not be a problem the ramp has the typical adjustment mechanisms incorporated the rear has a small green fiber optic in a short u shape which forms two green dots one to either side of the shallow u cut of the actual sight were i able to use open sights these would do nicely and are superior to those found on many others the barrel is also drilled and tapped and will accept mounts made for cva round barrels or the traditions yukon the traditions website is now offering mounts and other supplies for the genesis the barrel measures exactly 28

5786499 do you know what song i hate more than this
5786500 i cant believe i didnt recognize you without your cubs hat on
5786501 i just wanted to drop something off im meeting some friends
5786502 the original intention was to make a live album out of the whole tour selecting different songs from different nights
5786503 but so many of the best ones just seemed to come from that last night in gdansk that in the end we thought oh well just do the whole thing from gdansk
5786504 finding new feet a little bit as an artist after all these years
5786505 it was the most satisfying and enjoyable experience in my touring life
5786506 i think on the last solo record about face i made back in 84 i was a bit nervous about the pink floyd thing and wanted to stay away from it whereas most of what the pink floyd thing is a sound that i love on on an island i finally got to a place where i felt free from any pressure either way from that whole specter
5786507 the thought of going back to pink floyd just doesnt interest me
5786508 i want to get live in gdansk completely put to bed before i even worry about anything new
5786509 ive got a lot of material left over from on an island so ive got a lot of start points its good to have bits of music to start working on but how many of them i will actually use and how much new stuff will come up is anyones guess thats in the lap of the gods
5786510 this is usually a time when we want to turn our focus strictly to the classroom but people cant this year theres too much uncertainty
5786511 were going to come back and do the job but unfortunately we cant focus on whats going to happen in the classroom when we dont know whats going to happen to ourselves
5786512 we dont know what services will be available at our schools
5786513 we dont know which administrative staff are gone which teachers have been surplused
5786514 its going to get worse if they dont do a better screening
5786515 sometimes the packages sit in the office for a week and a lot of people get their medication that way
5786516 it should be the housing authority standing here and explaining what it is they can do for you
5786517 you cant even walk by there it is so bad
5786518 why cant the health department come in and condemn it
5786519 its a legal process and we are working on it
5786520 we are sick of that main street looking that way
5786521 we want action and we want it now we need the addresses and we need to contact people
5786522 fay is not something thats going to be out of our hair any time soon
5786523 its important for us to take it seriously its important for us to be prepared
5786524 what wed like to do is jump in the car and go but we cant do it not with gas at 4 a gallon
5786525 for the time i see a trend of moderate and above income people they cant pay their mortgage they are falling behind and they dont know what to do they are panicked
5786526 a lot of our seniors live on less than 900 a month
5786527 they think social security will be enough the message is social security is not enough
5786528 thats truly to serve the sen iors who really need this who without this program may not have a meal that day
5786529 their bottom line budget is not stretching as far as it used to
5786530 i think its the sign of the times and people are on the edge
5786531 we had a woman who came in recently who said her electric had been off for three months that is not as atypical as people would like to think
5786532 there are lots of people in the park who are getting by with a lot less
5786533 every little thing we can do to save money were doing thats about it
5786534 the agent made an announcement that this was one of jetblues
5786535 she never ever had the intent to cause any harm to anybody
5786536 she feels horrible about giving them false hopes that their daughter was still alive
5786537 it was more of a way of life for her it was surviving her life it was trying to move past esther reed and who she was in reality
5786538 she has a lot of things in her background and a lot of bad family relationships that she was trying to get away from
5786539 were glad to see this case to this resolution i hope this gives the family some sort of resolution

5786543 we havent been asked to provide him with any asylum or place of residence
5786544 ally who quit monday might stay abroad including in the united states
5786545 if he chooses to take up residence somewhere i mean if he were to request that we would obviously look at it but its not an issue that weve been approached with
5786546 we condemn this attack its just another example of the reach of extremists and we would support the government of algeria as best as we can in trying to fight this scourge
5786547 its another reminder of terrorism can hit any place any time anywhere and we all the international community have to stamp this out because in the end terrorism is a threat to all of us
5786548 the worst is over and things should really be quieting down
5786549 its one of the most vulnerable coastlines in the entire united states for storm surge
5786550 its sad to see them go sammy finger built a great brand
5786551 fingers has been a good name in the community for a long time i wish the family and employees well and hope the transformation is successful
5786552 the situation in the region and saudi arabias political and financial support for the palestinian authority
5786553 my guess is that it would take an airport closing for him not to come
5786554 there is a major tradition in the presidential campaign to pay homage to the veterans every four years
5786555 to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5786556 as a political proposition it would have been much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation
5786557 i sought a better bill im proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families and better serves the interests of our country
5786558 i just participated in a briefing on this yesterday and i want to assure the people of florida that we are going to make sure that they receive the assistance they need to prepare for and recover from this storm
5786559 theres a exceptional level of sensitivity in the post katrina world

5786561 coach pressler has done an exceptional job with our mens lacrosse program in his two seasons at bryant under mikes leadership our lacrosse program achieved unprecedented success both in the classroom and on the field we won two consecutive ne 10 championships and excelled in the classroom as demonstrated by the highest ever team gpa because of these factors and many others i am pleased to announce this contract extension which will keep mike pressler a member of our bulldog family well into the future i would not want any other coach to lead our mens lacrosse program into division i
5786562 coach pressler is not only a highly successful coach but an accomplished and respected educator
5786563 the high standards that he demands from his team will not only translate into success on the field but in the classroom and in life we look forward to many more years of coach pressler guiding the bryant mens lacrosse program

5786597 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally
5786598 president musharraf has made the right decision to step down as president of pakistan it is in the interests of his country and the pakistani people to end the political crisis that has immobilized the coalition government for too long i hope all of pakistans friends will now seize the opportunity created by musharrafs exit to focus on the urgent issues of today confronting the threat of extremist violence dealing with food and energy shortages and helping the pakistani people build a stable secure democratic future

5786602 this second prophecy is very hard to understand it is not clear what it wants to tell us although the maharal of prague has already explained that it is a prophecy referring to the future at the end of days in the days of gog and magog that in those days all of the nations will gather around jerusalem and this is the true interpretation
5786603 however i dont agree with his interpretation relating to gog and magog and my way of interpreting it is different to his so i will interpret these verses according to my own way

5786850 the narrowness of the bridge was a concern especially with a raised walkway but they really need more walking space there
5786851 the letter said the second option was the safest in light of potential costs
5786852 that option gives the 5 foot raised sidewalk two 10 inch shoulders and each lane is 10 feet wide
5786853 were trying to balance the safety of walkers and people riding bicycles as well as auto travelers we also considered plowing in the winter with a raised sidewalk were back to the 21 foot 8 inch bridge curb to curb with a 12 foot blade the blade would be over the center line if the path is not raised the plow could use it
5786854 the 5 foot un raised sidewalk eliminates the shoulder and therefore is not legal with the americans with disabilities act requirements
5786855 the walkway and shoulder and ada lane can be one and the same
5786856 as long as theres a 5 foot pathway it meets ada requirements whether its raised or not
5786857 i feel a raised sidewalk is much safer than a painted line in the road

5786966 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5786967 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately

5786978 the good thing about my time with cam i got a chance to learn a lot and be around cam and jim and watch us the diplomats one of the greatest movements and still one of the greatest movements doing this thing today i know the ins and outs of what it takes to build a powerful movement i know the things that got us to the points where we needed to be then i know some of the things that was holding us back i get to work around the things i need to work around jim has byrd gang i have the skull gang and freekey zekey has 730
5786979 its no hard feelings and now that im out of my situation i dont mind putting a diplomat album together

5786983 il consiglio dei delegati in parte eletto dai cittadini e in parte nominato dalla provincia di firenze stato privato della riserva statutaria riguardo alle retribuzioni economiche dei membri denunciano luca ragazzo consigliere della provincia di firenze per i verdi e annalisa pratesi e tommaso grassi portavoce provinciali di firenze poich la deputazione organo esecutivo dellente se ne appropriato irregolarmente deliberando i compensi al presidente bottino consigliere di sesto fiorentino e del vicepresidente pineti consigliere di calenzano
5786984 gravissimo latteggiamento assunto dai membri della deputazione composta oltre che dai due diretti interessati anche dai sindaci di signa di sesto fiorentino di campi bisenzio e di calenzano e da pasquini assessore a pontassieve affermano gli esponenti del sole che ride perch infrange due articoli dello statuto dellente di bonifica lart

5786986 risulta altrettanto grave la modalit di approvazione della delibera allinterno della deputazione del 23 luglio a cui erano presenti solo quattro membri su sette e di questi due erano il presidente e vicepresidente interessati direttamente dalla delibera e quindi in virt dellart 42 non avrebbero dovuto partecipare e pena la decadenza da tutte le cariche consorziali al voto dichiarano ragazzo pratesi e grassi se fosse stato rispettato lo statuto il numero legale sarebbe mancato e la delibera almeno rinviata a dopo lestate forse troppo tardi per riscuotere i compensi di presidente e vicepresidente

5786997 but two styles of landscape gardening the natural and the artificial one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery cultivating trees in harmony with the hills or plain of the neighboring land detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size proportion and color which hid from the common observer are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature the result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities in the prevalence of a beautiful harmony and order than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building there are the stately avenues and retirements of versailles italian terraces and a various mixed old english style which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape gardening a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is partly pleasing to the eye by the show of order and design and partly moral a terrace with an old moss covered balustrade calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days the slightest exhibition of art is an evidence of care and human interest
5786998 you will understand that i reject the idea here expressed of recalling the original beauty of the country
5786999 are less objectionable a mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty this is just and the reference to the sense of human interest is equally so i repeat that the principle here expressed is incontrovertible but there may be something even beyond it there may be an object in full keeping with the principle suggested an object unattainable by the means ordinarily in possession of mankind yet which if attained would lend a charm to the landscape garden immeasurably surpassing that which a merely human interest could bestow the true poet possessed of very unusual pecuniary resources might possibly while retaining the necessary idea of art or interest or culture so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference it will be seen that in bringing about such result he secures all the advantages of interest or design while relieving his work of all the harshness and technicality of art in the most rugged of wildernesses in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature there is apparent the art of a creator yet is this art apparent only to reflection in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling now if we imagine this sense of the almighty design to be harmonized in a measurable degree if we suppose a landscape whose combined strangeness vastness definitiveness and magnificence shall inspire the idea of culture or care or superintendence on the part of intelligences superior yet akin to humanity then the sentiment of interest is preserved while the art is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature a nature which is not god nor an emanation of god but which still is nature in the sense that it is the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god

5787011 home prices are becoming affordable again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
5787012 many analysts do not expect the financial markets to improve significantly until home prices stop falling the pace of existing home sales remains low and available invetory relatively high both indicating that buyers are not yet able to step into the market at current prices
5787013 however that could change within a year home prices are becoming affordable again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over
5787014 the median home price is now more affordable to the median household than at any time since the start of 2004 my analysis suggests that housing prices will have to fall a bit more but the housing market is not far from being reasonably valued for the first time in five years
5787015 meanwhile rental costs have remained stable and apparently have not had any effect on housing prices independent of household income historically there have been wide swings in the ability of the median household to afford an average house
5787016 in contrast the cost of renting a primary residence has tracked the growth in median household income very closely
5787017 the price appreciation in a hypothetical reit portfolio has followed the same long term trajectory as house prices have during the past fourteen years although reits have been far more volatile from month to month and have had corrects 1997 1999 and 2002 that housing prices did not experience
5787018 apartment reits are actually positive for 2008 that is consistent with the notion that housing prices are near their lows

5787291 as a precious gift of the holy spirit rooted in the gospel of jesus christ witnessed to in holy scripture summarized in ecumenical creeds celebrated in worship and sacraments demonstrated in common mission articulated in our teaching lived out in love and contended for by the faithful
5787292 since the bible and the church taught slavery and changed its view so must the church now change its stance on homosexuality

5787505 of course it will be a pop album what else could we do you do get some bands where their egos take over and they come back with a rockier sound but we know what we are good at and we are sticking to it
5787506 while she understands jamie likes to spend time with kate she worried that his focus on the band is slipping
5787507 shes particularly upset at present because shes frequently unable to track him down by phone or email at all
5787508 jamie didnt think it would be a permanent split he just had to wait for kate to calm down after their row

5787512 in essence this is a remaking of our entire digital strategy
5787513 we started thinking about this strategy 18 months ago when it was about the strongest deal market that we had ever seen
5787514 it may be that the audience for this isnt large enough its just a hard market to make money from i think their model anticipated more advertising revenue than theyve been able to get
5787515 the deal pipeline is an excellent vertical search tool for those who are seeking objective real time data and a customized newsfeed on industries that traditionally have been difficult to track efficiently such as the middle market and private sector

5787520 if anything musharrafs departure is a step in the right direction
5787521 our position is that we cant recommend the players tour pakistan
5787522 obviously we put a position forward a few weeks ago to the icc to that effect but we said we would keep an open mind with the task force which we did
5787523 we heard them speak on friday now we have had a chance to digest it all our position hasnt changed

5787526 the tournament is going ahead the teams have not withdrawn and we expect the best teams to participate
5787527 the only tournament i want is with the best teams and the best players
5787528 of course people have fears and people have concerns and rightly so because there are things happening in pakistan
5787529 but the england players were equally open minded and thoughtful in what they were listening to and what they were querying but it is a process we have to go through and a difficult one
5787530 the board is going to make a decision and we were fortunate to have a few members of the board at our meeting sunday and the board knows exactly the stance of the players
5787531 its a big decision for the board to make and the players have said whatever they needed to say

5787569 si de algo se han dado cuenta los parlamentarios del mercosur es la enorme presi n que ha montado el gobierno
5787570 que el poder legislativo defienda a capa y espada una decisi n administrativa de otro poder que es la contralor a
5787571 por qu no vino el contralor a defender su medida y por qu no mand a su gente a defender esa medida por qu tiene que ser el poder legislativo
5787572 es decir esas son las contradicciones que ac se est n dando cuenta y eso reafirma que en venezuela no hay autonom a de poder

5787575 de manera que veremos al tiempo una serie de reuniones de esta comisi n donde estar presente distintos y diversos casos por violaci n de ddhh

5787580 i just decided to go back to bu because i like the college experience i like college hockey and i dont want to leave bu after one season when it wasnt the best season at bu so i want to get back and have a better one
5787581 when it came down it i figured it was the place where id develop the most and also have the best time and hopefully win the championship
5787582 those three things were the three things that really factored in and from there i talked to coach parker to see where he was at and obviously talked to my parents but basically when it came down to it obviously it was my decision i just weighed in other peoples opinions
5787583 its a little bit more of a shorter schedule so theres more time to train and things like that and also its just a good group of guys at bu that im looking forward to be back to
5787584 its a nice situation being in an organization that they never have a real strict time period on when they want the person to make the jump
5787585 they never go oh its going to be this year or its going to be next year they just see how the player develops and wait until theyre finally ready to play

5787592 its always nice to be in a position to help people

5787666 im not going to comment specifically on what russian units or equipment are in the area right now
5787667 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out that would be in keeping with the russians commitment on withdrawal
5787668 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5787669 we will continue to closely monitor russian actions in georgia for confirmation of the withdrawal this is something that should be achieved without delay

5787720 we think they went into iran for additional training and to be resourced and we expect that those leaders will try to come back at some point in time in the future
5787721 even though we anticipate that some of these leaders will attempt to return soon we know that they will be returning to a much less permissive environment
5787722 over the last several months the people have been able to enjoy a much more peaceful environment i think the people appreciate that
5787723 and so the types of activities that these leaders bring to the neighbourhoods and the provinces i dont think will be as welcomed as they were in the past
5787724 in the last several months weve seen a much decreased flow of those types of weapons in part because weve been very successful in finding a number of caches that had large stores of those types of munitions and weapons

5787742 we do appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure especially since android will be deployed on many different devices that will require a large amount of co ordination to patch
5787743 help from security researchers in the form of usable bug reports and responsible timelines will greatly assist us in securing the ecosystem of android devices as quickly as possible
5787744 i think its a hard sell and i dont see much upside to tom ridge except for john mccain likes him a lot
5787745 i dont think hes going to be a big benefit in pennsylvania and even if he is i think the downside is the rest of the country among conservatives are going to be upset about this just at the moment theyre beginning to work up being excited about john mccain
5787746 if mccain picks a pro abortionist he will forfeit his moral authority and political advantage on the issue and might very well be conceding the election to obama
5787747 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever decision john makes

5787780 in these experiments we are asking a very fundamental question how can we better understand the detailed properties of neutrinos
5787781 in order to understand neutrino mixing and oscillations we must know the value of the unknown mixing angle
5787782 all we know so far is that it is small
5787783 this would show that the neutrino is its own antiparticle
5787784 currently some evidence suggests that neutrinos are different from antineutrinos while certain theories predict that they are actually the same particle it is important to understand whether those theories are true or not
5787785 there should have been equal amounts of matter and anti matter present at the big bang the beginning of the universe
5787786 today however matter dominates our earth explaining why we dont annihilate each other when we shake hands if the neutrino turns out to be its own antiparticle this might help us to understand more about this imbalance
5787787 this experiment asks key questions about how our corner of the universe exists today as it does with matter but no anti matter

5787808 we dont focus as hard as we should at incentivizing investment and innovation the lapse of the r amp d tax credit is enough of a political statement today where the government refuses to acknowledge that investing in r amp d is important to the future competitiveness of the u s everyone else in the world is recognizing that
5787809 since the wiimote can track sources of infrared ir light you can track pens that have an ir led in the tip by pointing a wiimote at a projection screen or lcd display you can create very low cost interactive whiteboards or tablet displays since the wiimote can track up to four points up to four pens can be used it also works great with rear projected displays
5787810 to be interesting today technology has to be the fastest the best the brightest the lightest but here you can see if you sacrifice a little bit of capability and performance for dramatic savings in cost you can have a pretty dramatic impact

5787872 mugabe is trying to cheat tsvangirai into believing that he will be in charge but tsvangirai smells a rat
5787873 the economy will plunge to unprecedented levels if these talks collapse
5787874 the review revealed no nutritional consult was requested and revealed no evidence the physician was notified about the inadequate nutritional intake

5788031 als uitlaatklep begon ik een aantal jaren geleden met het schrijven van columns op fok juist omdat ik niet wilde dat verward zou worden wat mijn mening was en die van rover heb ik een pseudoniem aangenomen driekoplopers door een loslippigheidje van de voorzitter van rover is langzaam bekend geworden wie driekoplopers eigenlijk is en dat is afgelopen weekend met een daverende klap in mijn eigen gezicht ontploft
5788032 ik heb daar acht jaar als vrijwilliger hard gewerkt ze waren op de hoogte van mijn nevenactiviteiten als wijsneus op fok
5788033 ik zat na die uitzending nog in de taxi naar huis toen het bericht al op de website van rover stond dat ik was ontslagen zonder dat er richting mij een telefoontje af kon dus ik vind echt dat ik door rover als een schurftige hond de vereniging ben uitgejaagd
5788034 ik heb geen spijkerharde afspraak met rover gemaakt wat ik moest zeggen ik heb alleen gezegd dat ik ging uitleggen hoe het zat
5788035 toen zei hij tegen me wat jij als pretcolumnist doet is jouw zaak s avonds was er weer contact toen zei hij ik vond het geen beste column je moet wel even sorry zeggen die excuses heb ik ook gemaakt bij nova
5788036 ik heb michael een mailtje gestuurd dat ik echt vond dat ik het niet verdiend had dat ik op zon manier moest vernemen dat ik eruit lag en daar heb ik een niet al te vriendelijk antwoord op gekregen een beetje van ik vond het ook niet makkelijk maar het besluit stond vast en daarom hebben we het bekend gemaakt

5788039 maar als men goed had gezocht had men allang geweten wie ik was in het vervoerderswereldje wist iedereen het ook zo maakte ik weleens grappen over ns directeur aart veerman maar hij weet dat ik het ben zo weet het publiek dus nog steeds niet dat ik het ben en dus ook niet namens rover spreek maar weten mensen waar ik mee werk het wel

5788041 een aardige vent belde me op hij zei dat iedereen kon zien dat die column satire was en ze wilden mij een weerwoord geven achter mijn rug om is nova de hele dag gaat bellen om aan mijn poten te zagen zo lieten ze de pvda in amsterdam zeggen dat ik mijn column op die website kwijt zou raken belden ze danny en hadden ze dus ook contact met rover
5788042 een kwartier van te voren zat ik met die redacteur te babbelen in de studio toen zij hij dat hij even moest bellen dat hij naar danny aan het bellen was daarnaast mocht ik het filmpje dat ze gemaakt hadden ook niet zien omdat het zogenaamd nog niet gemonteerd was achteraf blijkt dus dat ik gewoon naar de slachtbank werd gevoerd
5788043 een aardige vent belde me op hij zei dat iedereen kon zien dat die column satire was en ze wilden mij een weerwoord geven achter mijn rug om is nova de hele dag gaat bellen om aan mijn poten te zagen zo lieten ze de pvda in amsterdam zeggen dat ik mijn column op die website kwijt zou raken belden ze danny en hadden ze dus ook contact met rover

5788160 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5788161 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5788162 lets have a serious debate and lets debate our disagreements on the merits of policy not on personal attacks
5788163 no matter how heated it gets or what kind of campaign he chooses to run i will honor sen mccains service just like i honor the service of every veteran in this room and every american who has worn the uniform of the united states of america
5788164 he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country

5788173 he wants to ration care so the va only serves combat injuries while everyone else gets an insurance card while the va needs some real reform to better serve those who have worn the uniform privatization is just not the answer we cannot risk our veterans health care by turning the va into just another health insurer we need to make sure the va is strong enough to treat every veteran who depends on it
5788174 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies
5788175 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics
5788176 that was the past less dont look back and talk about what they can do for the country in the future
5788177 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists
5788178 i know evil and ill follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell
5788179 have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics

5788190 senior republicans are in the dark about who hell name although they say former massachusetts gov mitt romney and minnesota gov tim pawlenty are prime contenders after a trial balloon by mccain gave him very negative feedback about the idea of picking a pro choice running mate like former pennsylvania gov tom ridge

5788267 no se trata de copiar o adaptar las formas discursivas m s difundidas en el panorama medi tico
5788268 desde las homil as spot a las homil as blog tipo diario de las homil as hipertextuales con conexiones audaces de argumentos distantes a las homil as
5788269 hablar de la homil a por tanto significar ser conscientes de que est hecha de complejidad y de belleza aunque haya sido marginada maltratada a veces complicada o clericalizada o a veces sugestiva y acertada la homil a representa en cualquier caso un verdadero eje esencial e irrenunciable de la liturgia
5788270 no faltan estudios empe ados en desarrollar una sistem tica casi una metodolog a de la homil a
5788271 existen desde antiguo los diccionarios de homil tica textos que sugieren m todos de preparaci n a partir de diferentes modelos de homil as incluso esquemas ya preparados
5788272 el juego de la homil a debe ser concebido como la escucha com n y compartida de la revelaci n que llega a trav s de la palabra y de la historia
5788273 a n m s se trata de una gran ocasi n de recomponer y reconocer la memoria las identidades personales y colectivas y por otro lado de orientar los proyectos y recorridos de la acci n social
5788274 que el predicador hable muy muy clarito para que el que escucha se vaya contento e iluminado y no deslumbrado
5788275 la diferencia entre un pastor y un actor es precisamente el momento existencial que el pastor sea pobre cuando predica la pobreza que sea escarnecido cuando exhorta a soportar el escarnio mientras que el actor tiene la tarea de enga ar eliminando el momento existencial el predicador tiene precisamente el deber en el sentido m s profundo de predicar con su propia vida
5788276 san francisco exhortaba a sus frailes a que en la predicaci n usaran palabras ponderadas y castas para utilidad y edificaci n del pueblo anunciando a los fieles los vicios y las virtudes la pena y la gloria con discurso breve porque el se or dijo en la tierra palabras breves
5788277 hace pocos d as me hab a despedido de l y parec a que gozaba de buena salud nada hac a pensar en un desenlace ta r pido me uno al p same de los familiares y de toda la di cesis en la que era apreciado y amado por su empe o y entrega
5788278 la palabra de dios en la vida y en la misi n de la iglesia
5788279 era un experto y apasionado biblista autor de importantes publicaciones sobre el tema de la palabra de dios
5788280 es una gran p rdida echaremos de menos su contribuci n y su preparaci n ha declarado el arzobispo nikola eterovic secretario general del s nodo de los obispos era una persona amable sensible a los problemas del mundo actual que siempre le a a la luz de la biblia
5788281 cada vez m s en un gran grupo b blico compuesto por hombres y mujeres que bajo la gu a del magisterio participen en la lectura orante para ser evangelizados y ser evangelizadores
5788282 pocas personas de nuestra generaci n han encarnado con tanta transparencia el rostro manso y humilde de jesucristo
5788283 su muerte asesinado durante una celebraci n lit rgica a manos de una desequilibrada me recordaba unas palabras del profeta isa as sobre el siervo del se or maltratado se dej humillar y no abri la boca era como un cordero llevado al matadero como oveja muda frente a su trasquilador
5788284 el hermano roger ha seguido el camino del cordero con su dulzura y su humildad con su rechazo de todo acto de grandeza con su decisi n de no hablar mal de nadie con su deseo de llevar en su coraz n los dolores y las esperanzas de la humanidad
5788285 m s que a la rapidez del desarrollo del movimiento ecum nico l miraba a su profundidad
5788286 estaba convencido de que s lo un ecumenismo nutrido de la palabra de dios y de la celebraci n de la eucarist a de la oraci n y de la contemplaci n ser a capaz de reunir a los cristianos en la unidad querida por jes s
5788287 como un hilo conductor incluso en las decisiones m s concretas de cada d a acogiendo alegremente cada acci n que pueda acercar a los cristianos de tradiciones diferentes evitando toda palabra o gesto que pudiera retrasar su reconciliaci n
5788288 para m explic el purpurado el hecho de que cada a o miles de j venes sigan tomando el camino de la peque a colina de taiz es verdaderamente un don del esp ritu santo para la iglesia hoy
5788289 estoy contento de ver que los j venes que plantan cada verano las tiendas de taiz procedentes de diversos pa ses de europa occidental y oriental pertenecen a comunidades de tradici n protestante cat lica y ortodoxa y que a menudo acuden acompa ados por sus sacerdotes o pastores
5788290 como una par bola de la unidad que ayuda a superar las fracturas del pasado creo que muchos j venes se dan cuenta de lo que se juega con la unidad de los cristianos saben c mo el peso de las divisiones dificulta el testimonio de los cristianos y la construcci n de una nueva sociedad
5788291 encuentran dificultades para acompa ar bien a los j venes en su camino espiritual y en este sentido los grandes encuentros de taiz responden a una verdadera necesidad pastoral
5788292 gran continuidad en la vida de la comunidad de taiz y en la acogida a los j venes
5788293 la liturgia la oraci n y la hospitalidad contin an con el mismo esp ritu como un canto que nunca se ha interrumpido esto dice mucho no s lo sobre la persona del nuevo prior sino tambi n sobre la madurez humana y espiritual de toda la comunidad de taiz es la comunidad en su conjunto la que ha heredado el carisma del hermano roger y del cual continua a vivir e irradiar
5788294 la fe del prior de taiz se enriqueci con el patrimonio de la fe de la iglesia cat lica
5788295 recibi en muchas ocasiones la comuni n de manos de juan pablo ii que ten a lazos de amistad con l desde los tiempos del concilio vaticano ii y que conoc a bien su camino en la fe cat lica en este sentido no hab a nada de secreto o de escondido en la postura de la iglesia cat lica ni en taiz ni en roma
5788296 reconciliando en s mismo la fe de sus or genes con el misterio de la fe cat lica sin romper la comuni n con nadie
5788297 en su conciencia l hab a entrado en el misterio de la fe cat lica como uno que crece sin tener que abandonar o romper con lo que hab a recibido o vivido antes
5788298 por respeto al camino de fe del prior de taiz ser a preferible no aplicar en su caso categor as que l juzgaba inapropiadas para su experiencia y que por otro lado la iglesia cat lica nunca quiso imponerle
5788299 por una parte el prior de taiz se sent a muy cercano a los obispos de roma en su preocupaci n de conducir a la iglesia de cristo en el camino de la renovaci n espiritual de la unidad de los cristianos del servicio a los pobres y del testimonio del evangelio
5788300 se sab a profundamente comprendido y apoyado por los papas en su personal camino espiritual y en la orientaci n que iba tomando la joven comunidad de taiz
5788301 la conciencia de actuar en armon a con el pensamiento del obispo de roma era para l como una br jula en todos sus actos l nunca habr a tomado una iniciativa que supiera que iba contra el parecer o la voluntad del papa
5788302 por que esta participaci n es un factor determinante de toma de conciencia tanto en el mbito civil como hacer valer la voz ante las diferentes autoridades
5788303 debemos apoyar que con esta conciencia social puedan permitirse cambios estructurales en el manejo de seguridad en el pa s la coordinaci n efectiva y posible en los diferentes niveles federales estatales y municipales para que los cuerpos policiales sean mejor conocidos valorados y puedan cumplir en la sociedad su funci n de ser salvaguarda de la seguridad para el pa s creo que desde todos los frentes debemos sumarnos porque es fundamental para la vida de la sociedad
5788304 la violencia no domina la violencia si el enfrentamiento es con armas que desarmen estar a bien pero pedir que la violencia venza a la violencia est dif cil no podr amos decir que es un error pero s que es algo que hay que corregir cuando nos hemos dedicado a matar a quienes cometen cr menes
5788305 la iglesia no busca la muerte del pecador sino que se convierta y viva esto sonar a rid culo a o dos de algunos pero es la petici n de la iglesia
5788306 no s lo que no nos llegue la violencia a nosotros sino que no llegue a nadie
5788307 desterrando a la violencia en la familia porque es all es donde se empieza segundo educar a los hijos a respetar los valores no s lo a sus padres sino a ellos mismos y a la sociedad tambi n buscar alternativas de educaci n para los j venes para que ellos tambi n aprendan a no vivir s lo d ndose gusto y darle rienda suelta a sus deseos e instintos sino que respeten a los dem s
5788308 hay varias formas en que nosotros tambi n debemos involucrarnos y colaborar nosotros tenemos un arma muy fuerte que es la oraci n pero la oraci n siempre va acompa ada por la acci n y all logra la efectividad ojal que no s lo ning n cat lico sino que nadie se sienta al margen de este grave problema es preciso que todos nos involucremos
5788309 como sab is ped al cardenal camillo ruini que nombrara un tribunal en el vicariato de roma para que escuchara mi testimonio y el de las personas cercanas al siervo de dios
5788310 gracias a sus excepcionales dotes de inteligencia y disponibilidad muy pronto se convirti en la ayuda m s firme de san josemar a
5788311 vivi con fidelidad plena su vocaci n cristiana mediante la santificaci n del trabajo profesional y el cumplimiento de sus deberes y desarroll una profunda actividad apost lica caracterizada por una sincera y leal amistad entre sus compa eros de estudio y sus colegas de trabajo
5788312 la labor de gobierno de monse or lvaro del portillo se caracteriz por la fidelidad al fundador y a su mensaje y por el af n de servir a la iglesia

5788326 equiparar a la familia la uni n de personas del mismo sexo
5788327 en una democracia real el estado est al servicio de la persona y de la sociedad y no las personas y la sociedad al servicio de estado descubrimos que el estatismo parece ser un hilo conductor de la nueva constituci n
5788328 el derecho de los progenitores y el reconocimiento de la libertad de ense anza vienen contradichos cuando el estado se arroga el derecho de determinar lo que se tiene que ense ar y lo que se tiene que ignorar
5788329 bajo la afirmaci n de que la educaci n es un servicio p blico se considera la educaci n particular y fiscomisional como una mera concesi n del estado y no como una expresi n del derecho de los padres de familia
5788330 seremos en el refer ndum tan responsables como los propios legisladores respecto de las estructuras jur dicas y sociales que regir n al ecuador del futuro
5788331 seg n las estad sticas m s recientes al menos medio mill n de personas tiene contactos m s o menos frecuentes con estas organizaciones conocidas a menudo a trav s de la m sica las pel culas y los sitios de internet
5788332 se est n difundiendo mensajes de este tipo desde nuestras pantallas los j venes todos los d as en todas partes est n rodeados por estos mensajes en los que se habla m s del mal que del bien m s de la muerte que de la vida m s del demonio de satan s que de dios que es el autor de la vida
5788333 a menudo y f cilmente se aventuran a probar no olvidemos que dentro de estas sectas hay casi siempre consumo de drogas as como ritos muy particulares en los que siempre hay presencia de la sexualidad y los chicos se dejan influenciar
5788334 se trata de un fen meno social constituido por grupos y personajes que a veces no tienen nada que ver de hecho con el demonio sino que crean estas asociaciones con fines lucrativos para someter y manipular a las personas y despu s obtener una ganancia
5788335 its proved too dangerous to get into the surf line
5788336 curiosamente el subdesarrollo es un gran obst culo para luchar contra el subdesarrollo
5788337 es un hecho que el per est progresando y eso es muy positivo y creo que hay que reconocerlo es muy importante que la estabilidad que ahora existe y la continuidad de esas pol ticas que nos est n trayendo beneficios se mantengan
5788338 ese crecimiento hay que procurar que llegue de una manera m s homog nea al conjunto del pa s y sobre todo a los sectores que est n muy marginados donde hay todav a mucha frustraci n porque muchos peruanos sienten que los beneficios de este crecimiento no les llega
5788339 curiosamente el subdesarrollo es un gran obst culo para luchar contra el subdesarrollo
5788340 la econom a peruana est mucho m s relacionada con el resto del mundo de lo que estaba hace tan s lo cinco o seis a os el xito de este pa s es innegable el xito econ mico de buena conducci n y no solamente ese sino tambi n el xito pol tico en gran medida
5788341 de c mo se ha pasado de una situaci n de incertidumbre y bajo crecimiento econ mico y baja calidad de vida a una de mayor institucionalizaci n confianza y al mismo tiempo de mayor crecimiento econ mico

5788349 exit se odr ava na jednom od najlep ih mesta na kojima sam ikad nastupao
5788350 dugo sam ekao nastup na exit festivalu i zaista je vredelo ekati odli na lokacija i naravno izuzetna publika
5788351 por ejemplo en esta zona tenemos el anuncio de los proyectos de la cadena decameron y de fairmont los cuales dinamizar n la oferta en infraestructura tur stica
5788352 el nico caso sui generis dentro de provincias es trujillo capital del departamento norte o de la libertad donde la mayor a de inversiones hoteleras ser n en proyectos para el segmento corporativo como los anunciados por casa andina y ghl de colombia
5788353 est destinada a favorecer a los poderosos en especial al capital extranjero
5788354 esto no es producto del azar tiene que ver con la ausencia del sentido de patria y de un proyecto de desarrollo nacional por quienes detentan el poder
5788355 la redistribuci n de la riqueza social y que el pa s recupere gran parte de la riqueza generada por la explotaci n de nuestros recursos naturales para dirigirla no a las arcas de las transnacionales sino a inversi n en salud y educaci n
5788356 una econom a primaria exportadora y de subordinaci n a las transnacionales
5788357 esperamos un cambio de rumbo y se ponga fin a un manejo de la pol tica econ mica en el que el crecimiento no va acompa ado de desarrollo social y humano

5788407 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level

5788409 certainly there will be a lot of changes in our cooperation with nato and we will have changes in the volume the quality and the timeframe in our consultations and meetings
5788410 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia

5788423 i first started using game boards dolls and other childhood memorabilia in my paintings about 20 years ago but i didnt make them the focus of a series until i began working on these paintings about two years ago
5788424 i placed orchids in front of game boards within square format paintings to contrast beautiful living flowing plant material against well worn geometric patterns and then i expanded the scale of the work with nude figures against boards enlarged way beyond their actual size eventually i allowed the pictures to become more autobiographical by pulling in images from my recollections of the coney island amusement park near cincinnati
5788425 i visited an amusement park in connecticut with my family and i was struck by the images of garishly colored stuffed animals crudely painted signage bored attendants darts balloons and colored lights all of them associated with games of chance and skill
5788426 i remembered how exciting all of that was to me as a child how my daughter was reacting with the same enthusiasm and how the carnival had remained much the same as when it was depicted in drawings and paintings by such artists as edward hopper reginald marsh and isabel bishop i imagined how i might respond to these scenes of isolated lonely figures engaged in a business that was intended to be amusing challenging and rewarding i was especially intrigued by a game in which contestants would earn points by rolling balls with the number of points being used to determine how fast they could race cars occupied by ghosts the person who won the most points and moved his or her car to the finish line first would win a prize
5788427 i was determined to create these new paintings from life not photographs
5788428 i searched the internet to locate appropriate stuffed animals and then by chance i found a bag of them my daughter won at the very same amusement park it was tedious painting the graphic designs on the booths and the signage above and it took me a long time to determine where to position the stuffed animals and how to paint portraits of each of them
5788429 it seemed a little curious to be assigning so much importance to toys but a realist painter has to be willing to paint everything with the same degree of attention and detail
5788430 they may have been stuffed animals but they functioned within the pictures as colored shapes that would catch the viewers eye and contribute to the context of the ideas being explored
5788431 my inclination was to make them more polished and precise but that would have been inconsistent with the graphic images that are part of a carnival
5788432 in most cases placards were painted decades ago by amateur sign painters to identify the individual booths and to encourage people to compete for prizes
5788433 i actually had to add some unfamiliar paints to my palette to replicate the day glow orange iridescent blue and shocking purple of the bears in
5788434 and i spent many hours painting each of the pegs and their cast shadows on the spinning wheel included in whack a clown the combination of shapes textures and patterns in that painting were unlike any i had ever combined into one picture
5788435 i keep careful records of the canvas board paper colors preparation mediums model preparatory studies starting and ending dates and hours of labor involved in each of my paintings
5788436 i recommend that every artist keep such records for his or her own benefit i frequently refer to my notes when i want to recall how i achieved certain effects in a painting where i got the still life material who the models were what medium i used to modify the paints what varnish i applied once the picture was dry and where the paintings were exhibited and perhaps sold
5788437 i particularly enjoyed painting each of the balloons because several were translucent enough to reveal the numbers underneath while others reflected the colors and shapes of the nearby balloons
5788438 and i decided i wanted to paint a portrait of the young man in wheel of fortune as soon as he arrived at my studio in north salem new york to model for one of my summer workshops he was actually wearing that orange shirt and the decorated jean jacket and i thought they characterized the kind of rebellious free spirited drifter who would take off to join the circus his pensive gaze also suggested the contradictory emotions of a man who is supposed to be enticing people with a game of fun excitement and reward
5788439 i have long been fascinated by the decorative elements in russian icons and gold leaf decorations
5788440 on some level the antique boards and well worn signs serve a similar decorative function in the carnival paintings
5788441 on one level the painting uses a standard portrait device of positioning a figure against a warm brown background
5788442 but when you consider that the man is holding sharply pointed darts used to pop the balloons and penetrate the red and white wheel and that there is a folk art game in which contestants use a pistol to shoot metal objects extending from a mans mouth you recognize that games often involve a level of violence and destruction i suppose one could extend that recognition to include the current video games that treat violence as a form of entertainment

5788447 thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
5788448 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting

5788474 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
5788475 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
5788476 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
5788477 the mycoplasma infection completely blocked the protective response mice normally mount against tobacco smoke reducing antioxidant levels well below even those of mice breathing fresh air
5788478 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
5788479 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna
5788480 these higher levels of oxidative stress and damage are likely to predispose smokers with mycoplasma infections to lung disease such as copd or cancer
5788481 we show that a highly desired attribute of the job uthority omes with some interpersonal costs but those costs arent distributed equally across key social groups
5788482 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
5788483 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
5788484 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
5788485 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
5788486 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
5788487 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
5788488 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
5788489 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them

5788497 ihv has created a collaborative environment where multidisciplinary research education and clinical programs work to accelerate the development of pioneering therapies for hiv aids we are honored to have been accepted to discuss our data with ihvs respected team and members of the research and medical communities
5788498 our work is unraveling a link between inflammatory events that characterize early stages of infection the importance of inflammation on susceptibility to hiv and a link to an individuals mhc molecules
5788499 our findings suggest that with the proper predictions we can synthesize targeted peptides to treat people with different types of mhc alleles providing potentially an inexpensive biologically active therapy for hiv
5788500 while the results in human clinical trials are promising the challenge has been identifying the mechanism and the active component of the mixtures
5788501 it appears to be precisely when the non specific cells dont die on cue that chronic pathologies begin
5788502 peripheral cd4 loss of regulatory t cells is associated with persistent viremia in chronic hiv infection
5788503 depletion of regulatory t cells is associated with immune activation
5788504 we are very excited after many years of research to finally have discovered what appears to be the promising mechanism of action that could optimize our treatment to its fullest potential this also opens the door to a paradigm shift in thinking around hiv aids therapies

5788513 i had heard that tom cruise was reading the book and that he might be interested
5788514 then i got a call three days later telling me that he read all of sleeper loved it and said it was totally bad ass and that he wanted to be in it it was brilliant of sam raimi and his team to attach someone like tom cruise and then bring it directly to warner bros who already owned the property
5788515 ive been a huge fan of sam raimi ever since evil dead and you know tom cruise i was talking to comic writer brian michael bendis about this and he pointed out that say what you whatever you want about cruise hes got excellent taste in projects and hes a fantastic actor
5788516 theyll have to just figure it out and cut around some of the characters who appeard in other wildstorm books but this type of thing happens in hollywood all the time
5788517 when tom cruise gets involved in a project i dont imagine some guy like me whos just written a couple of screenplays would get that job writing the films screenplay staright off the bat just because he created the comic laughs honestly i hope they get the biggest screenwriter in the world on this i want it to be successful

5788563 his attitude and messages i think changed how some people looked at their lives he changed how i went about life
5788564 i feel like a piece of my heart is gone now the thing ill miss most is his smile he had a smile that could light up a room
5788565 i could see people having some beers and hopefully remembering how i always tried my best no matter what i was doing thats my message just for people to always do their best no matter what theyre doing or how stupid it might seem and no matter what there will always be a reward no matter how small it is

5788657 as you may expect building and maintaining a secure mobile platform is a difficult task
5788658 while we have found and fixed many of our own bugs as well as flaws in other open source projects we realize that the discovery of additional security issues in a system this large and complex is inevitable

5788670 it is time to put aside the global warming dogma at least to begin contingency planning about what to do if we are moving into another little ice age
5788671 the next little ice age would be much worse than the previous one and much more harmful than anything warming may do
5788672 there are many more people now and we have become dependent on a few temperate agricultural areas especially in the u s and canada global warming would increase agricultural output but global cooling will decrease it
5788673 there is no evidence that co2 has ever driven or will ever drive world temperatures and climate change the consequence of that is that worrying about co2 is irrelevant our prediction is world temperatures will continue to decline until 2014 and probably continue to decline after that

5788687 this is huge victory against one of the most egregious rollbacks of environmental protections in our nations history
5788688 as one of the first rollbacks of the bush administration this rule helped set a pattern of limiting the application of environmental laws to benefit polluters and denying the public the right to know about pollution in their communities public health should be a top priority not polluters profits todays decision will give states back the tools they need to hold polluters accountable and help ensure that everyone has clean healthy air to breathe
5788689 we are reviewing the courts decision and will determine an appropriate course of action once that review is complete in the meantime we are still assessing the implications of the decision

5788721 i think its a reflection of the fact that this is an enemy that needs to be taken on
5788722 this is a difficult time right now for the families and friends of those who died or were injured and we offer them our sincere condolences and sympathies
5788723 the lives of these soldiers are irreplaceable but this loss does not deter isaf from supporting the people of afghanistan in their fight against the enemies of peace and stability
5788724 this is another example of the enemies of afghanistans complete disregard for the people of afghanistan and the rule of law
5788725 i strongly condemn this callous and heartless attack on the people of afghanistan on this highly significant day of celebration
5788726 my resolve and that of the international community remain unwavering in our efforts to support the government of afghanistan and the people of afghanistan in bringing peace and security to their nation

5788796 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5788797 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5788798 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president

5788800 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that

5788826 i warned that war would fan the flames of extremism in the middle east create new centers of terrorism and tie us down in a costly and open ended occupation senator mccain predicted that wed be greeted as liberators and that the iraqis would bear the cost of rebuilding through their bountiful oil revenues

5789080 when patients who have a serious health emergency far from home are exposed to different healthcare systems high spending areas are associated with significantly lower mortality
5789081 i wanted to compare apples to apples and i found that the patients in high spending areas have higher survival rates than the ones in lower spending areas
5789082 typical comparison of a high spending area and a low spending one would represent a 50 difference in healthcare spending intensity such a disparity is associated with a 1 5 percentage point lower mortality rate among heart related emergency patients compared to a mortality of 6
5789083 i found that among local populations going to a teaching hospital was not associated with mortality possibly because these hospitals tend to treat sicker people however among tourists in an emergency situation going to a teaching hospital resulted in lower mortality
5789084 it looks like spending has an impact in terms of saving lives in emergency situations
5789085 there is a presumption that much of our healthcare spending is wasted
5789086 but high levels of spending may be justified because it also seems to increase survival rates in emergency situations

5789115 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave
5789116 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying a greater part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at any level
5789117 the future of our relations with russia will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the words of president dmitry medvedev which is not happening at the moment
5789118 but the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation in the community of states
5789119 a very clear statement that nato having come so far after the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5789120 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5789121 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5789122 we remain concerned by russias actions during this crisis and remind russia of its responsibility for maintaining security and order in the areas where it exercises control especially in light of continuing reports of russias deliberate destruction of civilian infrastructure
5789123 the declaration above all appears unobjective and biased because theres not a word about how all this started why it happened who started the aggressive action and who armed georgia
5789124 we call on russia to take immediate action to withdraw its troops from the areas it is supposed to leave

5789160 its just not our show but the entire channel is shutting down
5789161 time and time again customers have expressed to us their frustration with obtaining the right personnel and performance for their technology rollout project requirements
5789162 it is a frustration that grows exponentially as the number of site installations increases maestro is a comprehensive system that integrates in house expertise real world experience derived from a multitude of installations and the right partners to rapidly rollout any technology solution anywhere in the united states or international locations
5789163 what traditional deployment companies currently have in place isnt a solid business model for large scale nationwide and global rollout services that consist of hundreds or thousands of job sites you have to have a proven system comprised of a streamlined process structure unified rollout services model experienced internal resources and established partnerships to meet the needs of todays technology services industry
5789164 our customers count on us to be quick but at the same time provide a high standard of service quality and customer care
5789165 and thats exactly what our maestro technology rollout system does
5789166 at concert technologies we pride ourselves on our unique ability to integrate technology equipment and technicians to work together in a harmonious fashion at multiple sites nationwide or globally

5789169 the widening credit quality spreads in the money and bond markets is certainly unsettling
5789170 the market has handled bad news well for the past few weeks which could indicate that investors are beginning to look out into the future
5789171 for now though traders are back to the present and worried about the here and now we could get a test of the recent lows over the next few weeks
5789172 the us indicators today carry a strong flavour of stagflation
5789173 the credit crisis obviously didn amp squo t end at mid 2008
5789174 it isn amp squo t even obvious that the worst is over
5789175 theres been a suggestion that theyve been in the vicinity on and off for a couple of weeks but certainly no ones been seen sleeping in the bin or actually living in it

5789178 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5789179 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5789180 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5789181 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5789182 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5789183 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5789184 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5789185 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5789186 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5789187 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5789188 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5789189 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5789190 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5789191 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5789192 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5789193 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5789194 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5789195 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5789196 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5789197 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5789198 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5789199 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5789200 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us

5789226 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5789227 they told me there are going to be resources here
5789228 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5789229 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5789230 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5789231 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5789232 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5789233 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5789234 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5789235 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote

5789241 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5789242 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5789243 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5789244 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5789245 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5789246 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5789247 the pension savings and state benefits of the average family still fall well short of the recommended income replacement rate of 66 100 being working life income
5789248 it seems the uk working population also has unrealistic expectations of when they want to retire the desired age currently stands at 62
5789249 a day will make it easier for people to engage with pensions
5789250 too much of the time we have to tell people what they cant do in future people will be free to do far more with pensions
5789251 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5789252 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5789253 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5789254 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5789255 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions

5789265 none of my family are responsible for this but me
5789266 okay i need help here but they record these calls so i need to choose my words carefully
5789267 just one week before the story of her affair broke
5789268 every day in every way the john edwards story gets better and better
5789269 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
5789270 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
5789271 oh my god can i come and work for you people
5789272 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
5789273 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
5789274 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
5789275 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
5789276 how did i ever live without the keen insights and cutting observations of deceiver
5789277 you can live comfortably off this if you dont have high ambitions like travelling the world or keeping the same lifestyle as when you are working any luxuries you want to permit yourself need to come on top of that
5789278 buy to let is an investment which combines both capital growth and income
5789279 when property prices drop the rental income becomes proportionally larger however when prices rise the rental income becomes proportionally smaller
5789280 over the long term though both the capital value of the property and the rental income should go up making buy to let a balanced investment
5789281 i wouldnt be at all surprised if we were a 10bn fund inside five years that is merely a reflection on the rate of insolvencies and the question of how much of a deficit is crystallised on the insolvency of an employer
5789282 the reason deficits have increased has generally been through macro economic and demographic factors the largest is that we are actually living longer
5789283 business has been doing a good job of recognising the increase in deficits and putting extra contributions in something between 17bn and 20bn in extra deficit contributions
5789284 we have been busily monitoring the solvency of companies and pension schemes gathering data from scheme returns
5789285 in the last few years in the uk deficits have gone up quite a lot we discovered that the amount of risk out there in the system was much much higher than people had really appreciated
5789286 we are rather like a messenger charged by the government to go out and measure the amount of risk and come back to tell people how much risk is out there
5789287 we took the view that we wouldnt pre fund for those things because the contingency is remote but if it happens we will face up to it then
5789288 what we need to monitor is how many of the larger schemes are in distress and how far in advance we can discover this
5789289 all of the big failures that occurred in the us you could actually spot about 3 years in advance as the business slid down the credit ratings
5789290 no i dont think it would the key thing is whats the deficit very rarely if ever will there be a cash flow problem for a pension fund so you do have time to build up the extra reserves
5789291 what we would like to do is make a lot of that information available to the public as a public service there are many people in the pensions industry who would be very interested to see exactly what the shape of the risk is
5789292 in a capitalist system of competitive businesses insolvencies are going to occur some companies are going to succeed some will go down
5789293 hundreds of companies are going to do this its going to become a very common feature over the next six months
5789294 a company may have been taken over or the pension scheme been merged in the past with a promise to members of no change to the pension scheme
5789295 later the employer says they want to cut back on benefits for future service and someone digs up the old promise
5789296 some rules have entrenched provisions which prevent changes for the future
5789297 we have always supported the idea of consultation but employers need the power to redesign schemes in line with the companys financial position
5789298 some consultations are a sham some arent a lot think consultation is just telling
5789299 we dont have powers preventing employers making changes for future provision
5789300 changes are in practice being made and agreed in quite a few companies where the dynamics of the business and the risk have been explained
5789301 it was pretty obvious to me that a company so small would not be able to make that payment
5789302 in fact if the company had not called in the administrators the trustees would have done as we could see the company couldnt make the payments
5789303 im very hopeful we can sell the business as a going concern we need another month at it before we can conclude
5789304 the company has a lot of new business coming in it is starting to grow and we are thinking of taking on more staff in 2007
5789305 we will identify all scheme members there will be a lot of data cleaning we will also make sure there has been no fraudulent activity
5789306 an asymmetry between a state pension age quite rightly rising now to 68 by 2045 while someone who joined the civil service before 2005 even if currently aged only 25 will retire at age 60
5789307 the disparity between public and private sector workers is unsustainable and will threaten the durability of the proposals in this bill
5789308 we are making substantial changes to public service schemes to secure their long term sustainability the reforms will achieve the savings that were originally projected
5789309 a major step forward towards a more generous and less means tested state pension system
5789310 most ambitious reform of the pensions system in modern times
5789311 we are keeping a final salary scheme while some other companies have abandoned theirs
5789312 were also protecting current pensions with the changes only relevant to future service
5789313 it is common sense to assume the deficit will have grown even more
5789314 these changes are necessary to clear the past deficit and to contain the amount of future funding needed
5789315 it means working longer to get a similar amount of pension but one that is more secure
5789316 the union is concerned that there is little room for individuals to make a choice on when they retire on a full pension
5789317 auf wie vielen rechnern befindet sich diese version von dem windows
5789318 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5789319 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5789320 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5789321 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5789322 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5789323 he prince seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
5789324 his apocalyptic predictions of the effect of genetically modified crops do not enhance public debate but degrade it
5789325 entirely luddite attitude to simply reject this gm crops out of hand
5789326 prince charles lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
5789327 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5789328 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5789329 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5789330 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5789331 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5789332 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5789333 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5789334 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5789335 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5789336 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5789337 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5789338 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5789339 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5789340 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5789341 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5789342 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5789343 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5789344 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5789345 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5789346 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5789347 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5789348 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5789349 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5789350 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5789351 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5789352 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5789353 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5789354 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5789355 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5789356 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5789357 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5789358 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5789359 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5789360 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5789361 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

5789376 the younger generations of modern orthodox jews are seeking new meaning to their religious expression going beyond survival and anti assimilation and just text study
5789377 there have been countless individuals who have felt estranged from the orthodox community who have been in touch with us were getting hundreds of e mails saying that this has filled a gap
5789378 even if they had said years later your pension will be a few pounds more i couldnt have done it because we needed the money to live on
5789379 i didnt want to do it you feel kind of ashamed that you are having to do it telling people all about your personal financial income
5789380 i rang the free phone number and it was an awful thing to go through talking about your personal finances horrible you are exposing yourself the whole process was intrusive
5789381 at first it got me 11 a week which probably sounds like nothing but when you are on a low income it makes a big difference and now its 16 a week and i dont have to pay the full council rent and council tax
5789382 theres a look of resignation on their faces maybe some go away and do it but theres a lot who arent
5789383 if we had a reasonable state pension that allowed us to do the things we wanted to do we wouldnt have to go through those hoops they should do away with means testing id rather have a decent state pension so i could pay my own way

5789387 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5789388 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5789389 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

5789393 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5789394 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5789395 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5789396 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years

5789408 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5789409 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5789410 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5789411 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5789412 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5789413 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5789414 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender

5789417 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5789418 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5789419 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5789420 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5789421 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5789422 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5789423 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5789424 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5789425 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5789426 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5789427 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5789428 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes

5789437 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5789438 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5789439 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5789440 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra

5789445 newspaper wrap up google has a difficult time getting ad revenue from youtube add your comments
5789446 the underlying problem is that democrats care about means as well as ends while republicans care almost exclusively about ends and will use any means to get there the paradox lies deeper for most democrats the means are part of the ends we want an electoral process that eschews the lying and cheating weve witnessed since richard nixons dirty tricks if we use their tactics we undermine our own goal violating one of the very things that distinguishes us from them yet if we dont stoop to their level how can we prevail in a system that allows even rewards such lying and cheating
5789447 i have often as an exercise and as a sustenance painted before an object down to the smallest accidents of its visual appearance but the day left me sad and with an unsatiated thirst the next day i let the other source run that of imagination through the recollection of the forms and i was then reassured and appeased
5789448 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5789449 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5789450 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5789451 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5789452 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5789453 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
5789454 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

5789463 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5789464 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5789465 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5789466 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5789467 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5789468 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5789469 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5789470 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5789471 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5789472 im so impressed with the work that youre doing and the information youre disseminating its just vital for people to get this sort of information
5789473 mike adams has one of the best websites on the internet his articles podcasts and books will improve your life and possibly save it
5789474 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5789475 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5789476 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5789477 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5789478 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5789479 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5789480 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5789481 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
5789482 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
5789483 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
5789484 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
5789485 she was a stray but she worked her way up
5789486 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
5789487 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5789488 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5789489 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5789490 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5789491 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5789492 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5789493 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5789494 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5789495 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5789496 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5789497 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5789498 the race in iowa while relatively close appears to be moving in obamas direction
5789499 confidence in your candidate is another motivator to actually get out and vote
5789500 when you believe you will win its all the more reason to show up at the polls when you think you will lose its easier to not bother
5789501 we cant directly ask voters if they are unwilling to vote for someone because of race
5789502 but we can ask what they think others will do it seems clear though that race is a factor even if its hard to quantify
5789503 its very clear that voters who continue to support george bush will vote for john mccain
5789504 not only is this a simple continuation of partisan support but mccain is clearly associated with supporting much of the bush agenda and voters recognize the connection
5789505 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5789506 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5789507 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5789508 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5789509 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5789510 and once they have those numbers they can use them again for mobilization
5789511 on ne peut pas faire comme si de rien n tait avec moscou la nature de nos relations futures avec la russie va d pendre des actions quelle va engager dans les jours qui viennent le pr sident medvedev doit honorer les engagements quil a pris en signant le plan de paix et ce nest pas le cas pour le moment
5789512 i can just tell from trading its not a good environment out there
5789513 it just doesnt feel right it feels like its going lower
5789514 i think were stuck in a downward channel for a couple years
5789515 this process of deleveraging thats occurring is a very significant headwind for the economy its going to take a while for the banks to right themselves
5789516 i would buy stocks that have worldwide exposure id buy blue chip names definitely
5789517 buy in different sectors spread out your portfolios adjust and buy the best names
5789518 rather than trying to time the market i would stick with a defensive portfolio
5789519 you want to look at things with relatively stable cash flows relatively predictable earnings
5789520 in the biotech space were seeing the next generation of some blockbuster drugs coming out which i think are going to be pretty significant
5789521 on the financials i wouldnt short them and i wouldnt buy them i would avoid the sector totally to me its dead money
5789522 until theres some clarity clarity means that things calm down and volatility calms down i wouldnt go near financials in the short term i think energy metals and the agricultural areas are going to bounce
5789523 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5789524 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5789525 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5789526 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source

5789528 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5789529 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5789530 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5789531 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5789532 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5789533 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5789534 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5789535 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5789633 by installing solar pv solar thermal and energy efficiency solutions at home and at work
5789634 it started with the people asking our government why we use so little solar and no energy saving solutions now that our utilities commission and general assembly have shown leadership in beginning to answer these questions with aggressive policies it must now continue with the people choosing to use these solutions to reaffirm that our leaders made the right decisions from what we have learned through our industry surveys people are doing so in droves
