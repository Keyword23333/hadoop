3260027 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3260028 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3260029 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3260030 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3260031 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3260032 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean

3260065 truly i say to you unless you turn and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven 4 whoever humbles himself like this child he is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
3260066 whoever receives one such child in my name receives me
3260067 see that you do not despise one of these little ones for i tell you that in heaven their angels always behold the face of my father who is in heaven
3260068 what do you think if a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray does he not leave the ninety nine on the hills and go in search of the one that went astray 13 and if he finds it truly i say to you he rejoices over it more than over the ninety nine that never went astray 14 so it is not the will of my father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish
3260069 what is the essential thing in the religion and discipline of jesus christ i shall reply first humility second humility and third humility

3260071 in children and in the sick a soul in love sees him
3260072 by gods providence angels have been entrusted with the office of guarding the human race and of accompanying every human being so as to preserve him from any serious dangers our heavenly father has placed over each of us an angel under whose protection and vigilance we are
3260073 have confidence in your guardian angel treat him as a lifelong friend that is what he is and he will render you a thousand services in the ordinary affairs of each day
3260074 unfortunately we witness the moral pollution which is devastating humanity disregarding especially those very little ones about whom jesus speaks
3260075 what must we do we must imitate the good shepherd and give ourselves without rest for the salvation of souls without forgetting material charity and social justice we must be convinced that the most sublime charity is spiritual charity that is the commitment for the salvation of souls and souls are saved with prayer and sacrifice this is the mission of the church

3260223 but actually now that i think about it they should have offered to buy you drinks right i know that is so tacky so maybe no maybe ill tell them that youre out because one of you is engaged who wants to be the engaged one how about you put the right on the other hand like they wouldnt even know and ill just tell them you are celebrating right it will be so funny
3260224 yeah like that works too el oh el oh by the way theres a 25 credit card minimum
3260225 i always thought john edwards was different from the typical politician
3260226 weve had x rays on it and the x rays showed it was ok but hes just feeling a bit of pain when hes running on it so we want to be a bit cautious about it said coach dave mitchell
3260227 id rather go on the side of caution rather than trying to play him and making it worse and hes out for 6 10 weeks
3260228 hes an important part of our squad and hes our top scorer for the last couple of years so hell be putting pressure on people that will be playing mitchell said
3260229 hes a good character as well and hes perth glory through and through
3260230 this the olympics are the sports biggest bang youd think the ioc would love that
3260231 we want to enjoy every moment and take advantage of this experience abbott said
3260232 for someone like me even if softball comes back for 2016 i will be 30 or 31 years old who knows if i will be on the team
3260233 thats why our goal is to get it back abbott said
3260234 then maybe some girls will get a chance to relive in 2016 what were living right now said abbott
3260235 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children
3260236 its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3260237 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3260238 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile
3260239 house to house inquiries are continuing in the vicinity of the crime scene and the search of the scene is ongoing looking for possible weapons used in the attack
3260240 we are using chinese media outlets internet websites and community contacts to try and build up a lifestyle profile of the victims and identify the last sightings of the couple alive
3260241 why you still talking money shit cuz i like money bitch
3260242 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spinoff
3260243 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you
3260244 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you if you dont let it get the anne hathaway on her hopes for love
3260245 the worst thing that happens to you can be the best thing for you if you
3260246 yeah i just didnt like them they needed to go
3260247 the tonic develops the flavor but the soda cuts the sweetness yessir you need that limey acid to make it all work
3260248 i was angry at quarter time and the way we were playing was just like we did in the claremont game we were showing no respect for our opponent and just didnt go near them so i gave them a good talking to and the boys responded well
3260249 i was really proud of how we attacked the ball and opposition after that we were really hard it put great pressure on them and we played some exciting footy we finished off the game well too so i couldnt be happier
3260250 the midfield pressure was great and once we started getting our hands on the footy a bit more and not letting perth do whatever they wanted things started turning around we threw ryley dunn in the middle and that worked really well as he got his hands on the footy and really gave us a lift
3260251 robert young was also great in the ruck with his aggression around the stoppages hardness and he showed great leadership around the ground kyanga was very exciting we moved monk forward and as a kid from gosford he is really exciting he fell in our lap really has a strong body and gave us a good spark up forward the lift really came mentally and once we switched on we started doing well
3260252 hes kyanga a geraldton boy was part of the clontarf program and is a really exciting player he wasnt around with us early in the season but came down and has been playing colts footy we also got him playing some reserves games and he was the something different we have been looking for in our forward line
3260253 he had played against men in geraldton so he wasnt going to be intimidated by coming up against men he has tremendous pace skill and gave us the spark we were after he hit the packs hard finished off in front of goal well and can be exciting for the future
3260254 basile has also been terrific for us as a small forward he has been lively is hard and a smart little player leslie also made his debut and we used him as a small forward and he showed some good things its exciting to see these young players coming through
3260255 after finishing his afl career he green wanted to come back and enjoy his footy he wasnt having the impact in the middle he or we wanted so we pushed him back and he has been loving it down there
3260256 he uses the ball so well and sets it up nicely for us back there as well as him our whole defence was very good macpherson blanketed seamus young who has been a bit of a bogey player for us this year hardingham was good when he was back there weller was great so we were very happy with our defence
3260257 weller had it 25 times and was able to nullify thornton which was a good effort he had played there the majority of his career at brisbane and richmond so it was a little strange to see him play the whole year forward last year and he struggled for the most part
3260258 this year weve used him mostly back and hes been terrific he is a smart player knows when to go and when to defend actually has good closing speed and his aggression is something we also love he is also showing great leadership for us
3260259 liam has had a fantastic season he still has a lot to improve on and learn as he goes on i told him at the start of the year that he needed to pull his finger out and he has lifted well in all the areas he needed to
3260260 he is trying to improve all the time and on saturday was another new experience for him as it was the first time he was tagged clay mclernon went to him for most of the day and he was able to work through that and still have it 25 times and kick a couple of goals hes very smart has good hands and skills and is probably the best kick in our side he still has a tremendous upside to him as well so thats exciting if he gets drafted he deserves it and hopefully he finishes the season off as well as he has done it so far
3260261 viney monteath and venturini all went back to the reserves with a great attitude and its fantastic that we have a number of reserves guys putting pressure on the league side
3260262 we also have a number of colts guys pushing up who are doing well and guys like cooper and brennan arent far off making their debut
3260263 we desperately want to win a derby this year and will be doing everything we can to do that this week
3260264 we played really well on foundation day for most of the day but just fell short were pretty ordinary in round 2 and hopefully we turn it around this week its a big game for both teams it will be nice to see a big crowd turn up and its the perfect chance for us to beat a top two team and continue our good form
3260265 and i dont wear jerseys im thirty plus give me a crisp pair of jeans button ups
3260266 youre going to have to start acting more black if possible
3260267 i think theres a place with cool bathrooms near here

3260271 all i want to do is walk through the duty free to get to the bar on the other side
3260272 do you have a seat where i can plug into an outlet
3260273 we only have one outlet and if theres a power surge it could knock out our microwaves
3260274 man that sucked but im sure glad that place exists or else id never have gotten to where i wanted to be
3260275 the international community collectively held their breath waiting for the reaction of russia after the savage brutal criminal attack by georgia on south ossetia
3260276 after having offered a cease fire in hostilities the back stabbing georgians immediately violated the cease fire invading south ossetia and causing massive destruction and death among innocent civilians among peacekeepers and also destroying a hospital
3260277 russian moving towards tbilisi capital of georgia all bog towns are either bombed or taken by russians this is not peace keeping

3260279 russian media is feeding russians horse s t they have no idea whats goin in georgia cnn bbc or whatever news agency please say truth
3260280 i am convinced the frustration we got by not winning it last season will come out for good
3260281 it will strengthen our resolve to do it this time
3260282 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and now we want to continue we were a short way from winning the league and the champions league that is why we want to continue with the way we play and keep the belief
3260283 israel will have the worlds first virtual oilfield in the negev desert
3260284 today in europe you pay 600 a month for gasoline
3260285 we have an electric car that will cost you 600 a month
3260286 so cheap so trivial that you wont even think of buying a gasoline car
3260287 we are on the verge of losing our superpower status
3260288 we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of 700 billion a year i have been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of if we create a renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil

3260295 ik wilde eigenlijk alleen maar op kop zwemmen maar wat ik in die eerste 100 meter heb kunnen bijeen zwemmen ik wist dat park sterk zou komen opzetten in de laatste 50 meter maar ik heb me niet laten afleiden en ben geconcentreerd gebleven

3260310 im the only one who is indianised in the film my role is set in the year 1996 and i play a punjabi girl but we didnt want the look to be typically punjabi we wanted it to keep it funky and slightly modern
3260311 my character mahi has worn patiala salwars with spaghetti tops and kurtis with capris in fact the patiala salwars with tops has become a rage among college students in mumbai i dont know about delhi though

3260315 i think in the next few months we will further see a slowdown in inflation
3260316 producer price figures showed costs pressures remained quite big while consumer price figures showed price rises on the consumption side have eased
3260317 what is especially encouraging is that the price hike on oil products prices in june did not change the declining trend of the inflation

3260350 the very great majority of the thousands of schoolboy matches that take place each weekend go off without incident however any incidents of fighting are to be condemned
3260351 it is particularly worrying that some of these occurrences appear to have been instigated by spectators rather than players
3260352 the unions and schools work hard to promote and develop rugby among our children and these incidents are not reflective of the good work they do
3260353 we would particularly urge parents to show restraint on the touchlines and observe the values of fair play and camaraderie that are so central to the game of rugby
3260354 mongolian mfa is very concerned about south ossetia issues especially it feels sorry for the loss of people it is believed that the issues would be solved via talks and negotiations in amiable ways
3260355 i think we have to keep explaining to african leaders the case what we are doing and then they can fulfil their own responsibilities
3260356 i was providing him with some details as to why i am pursuing these cases in sudan
3260357 i believe these massive crimes in darfur cannot be committed without political support so if the african leaders are clear about the crimes they will be very important in stopping the crimes because at the end of the day the victims are african women who are being raped and killed in the camps the victims are african children exposed to conditions that mean they will die
3260358 i believe we have a common goal to stop the crimes
3260359 you can be friends but the law is the law

3260375 so as i review the great move toward technological innovation in the classroom i find myself recoiling in horror i just dont get it of his oh so forlorn students who dont read and can only become excited when engaging with their own methods of discourse drove me crazy
3260376 as the media theorist marshall mcluhan pointed out in the 1960s media are not just passive channels of information they supply the stuff of thought but they also shape the process of thought and what the net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation my mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it in a swiftly moving stream of particles once i was a scuba diver in the sea of words now i zip along the surface like a guy on a jet ski
3260377 it almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense
3260378 when we read online she says we tend to become
3260379 the lecturer finds in the particularities of the space which the traditional institution arranges for him the platform the professorial chair at the focal point on which all gazes converge material and symbolic conditions which enable him to keep the students at a respectful distance and would oblige him to do so even if he did not wish to elevated and enclosed in the space which crowns him orator seperated from his audience if numbers permit by a few empty rows which materially mark the distance the laity fearfully keep before the mana of the word and which at all events are only ever occupied by the most seasoned zealots pious ministers of the material utterance the professor remote and intangible shrouded in vague and terrifying rumour is condemned to theatrical monologue and virtuoso exhibition by a necessity of position far more coercive than the most imperious regulations
3260380 anyway my bias is i love lecture i loved it throughout undergraduate and graduate school i was interested and involved because of lecture i read because of lecture i think it works well is small classes i think it can work in large classes
3260381 his strong background in both retail and consultancy together with his particular experience in achieving a turnaround at focus he brings the strategic and operational skills that the group needs to help it move to the next stage of its development

3260429 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3260430 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3260431 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3260432 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients

3260451 there is an unmistakeable degree of recovery in july which is surprising given that it is generally regarded as the worst winter month with good improvement in median prices around the country despite continued low sales volumes
3260452 but as we have pointed out before those qv statistics are based on property settlements whereas ours are based on unconditional contracts so inevitably the earlier statistics relate to june sales reported in july
3260453 as for the long term prognosis there are plenty of people taking about a 10 per cent decline in values but based on todays figures a decline of that magnitude is not evident yet
3260454 if this is as bad as it gets then perhaps the market is in better shape than we thought
3260455 northlands median price was back up after a big fall in june to 302 750 at 315 00 for july while waikato and the bay of plenty was up from 316 000 in june to 325 000 in july
3260456 hawkes bay provided particularly strong evidence of its recovery with an increase in the median price for the district from 216 000 to 282 000 while manawatu and wanganui were up from 213 750 to 233 750
3260457 taranaki was up from 255 000 to 265 000 and wellington was up from 366 500 in june to 371 000 in july
3260458 nelson and marlborough were again a little weaker with a median down from 335 000 in june to 330 000 but canterbury and westland recovered slightly from 299 000 to 300 000
3260459 central otago lakes district was up from 514 000 to 565 000 but on low sales while otago rallied from 225 000 in june to 240 000 in july

3260513 its a huge wrinkle when you have backs coming out of the backfield and making plays in the passing game
3260514 it can cause some matchup problems in the defense and allow us to do some other things offensively with formations and schemes having two backs of the caliber we have is a special thing

3260610 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3260611 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3260612 its been an interesting last month but i think our team has gotten pretty tight
3260613 the support from our teammates throughout the day today was definitely encouraging
3260614 i was just hoping i was going the right direction
3260615 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3260616 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him
3260617 i can pretty confidently say that no other quarterback in the league has ever stepped into a situation that hes stepped into
3260618 but hes handled it tremendously he played extremely well tonight and you could tell the organization you can tell why they have confidence in him
3260619 once we got going we were sharp we were crisp we moved the ball effectively and got a couple of touchdowns
3260620 it was just good to just get that first game rust off and get some confidence on those last couple of drives and get ready for the next one
3260621 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3260622 im going to go out and have some fun like i always do every year
3260623 yall know how i am im going to have fun trust me

3260628 i cant seem to win them any way else isner said

3260631 i was a little nervous out there to be honest with you devvarman said
3260632 he looks like hes primed to go ahead and be the guy that we need
3260633 i dont think hes had the best luck in the world this year
3260634 im not thinking about my start six weeks from now
3260635 my main goal is to get us into the eighth inning with the lead and unfortunately i wasnt able to do it it was tough knowing we had a one run lead against a team like this that any one of them can hit a homer at any time i knew there wasnt much room for error with beckett hes a great proven pitcher and he had his a stuff today
3260636 its just frustrating for us to have danks pitch as well as he did and not come out of there with the win

3260638 our study suggests that if sea ice continues to contract rapidly over the next several years arctic land warming and permafrost thaw are likely to accelerate
3260639 an important unresolved question is how the delicate balance of life in the arctic will respond to such a rapid warming
3260640 will we see for example accelerated coastal erosion or increased methane emissions or faster shrub encroachment into tundra regions if sea ice continues to retreat rapidly
3260641 the loss of sea ice can trigger widespread changes that would be felt across the region

3260710 you gravitated towards those primarily responsible because they offered you friendship you were easily taken in and manipulated by them
3260711 i accept that there was no significant monetary benefit for you as a result of your assistance to them nevertheless these are serious offences that you have committed
3260712 it is my view that as a result of that combination of circumstances that you are unlikely to offend again
3260713 pressure is a privilege lessons ive learned from life and the battle of the sexes
3260714 that match taught me a lot dealing with the media and the attention and pressure and what it stood for the symbolism of the womens movement
3260715 its a fun read it will take you an hour and half its quick
3260716 besides chapters on pressure is a privilege and champions adjust i talk about integrity and my heroes that were important in my childhood like my teachers rev bob richards and alice marble

3260731 if he can play football he can play if he cant then well move on
3260732 he made it through this much of camp without the spasms which he hasnt done in the past
3260733 he enjoys starting at guard but if you ask him his choice hes going to tell you tackle
3260734 hes doing a heck of a job at guard right now too hes having his best camp so far
3260735 let me rephrase that with tra out there id rather play guard

3260749 there are studies that link low vitamin d levels to the development of heart disease peripheral arterial disease diabetes hypertension and different cancers
3260750 those who had the lowest levels of vitamin d had a 26 percent higher risk of death from all causes compared to those with the highest vitamin d levels
3260751 i think people should optimize their diet and sun exposure to get an adequate level of vitamin d without taking supplements
3260752 it may be a good idea for people who are at risk for vitamin d deficiency including african americans and people who dont spend a lot of time in the sun to get their vitamin d levels checked by their doctor
3260753 we know that being vitamin d sufficient reduces the risk of having your first heart attack by more than 50 percent reduces the risk of having peripheral vascular disease by as much is 80 percent and decreases the risk of prostate colon breast and a whole host of other cancers by as much is 50 to 70 percent
3260754 no thank you ill wait on the ice cream could you drive me to urgent care
3260755 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare

3260761 everything characteristic about the condition we call modern life has been a direct result of our access to abundant supplies of cheap fossil fuels the age of fossil fuels is about to end there is no replacement for them at hand
3260762 also extremely corrosive it likes to combine with other elements and compounds
3260763 industrial farming dependent on massive oil and gas inputs at gigantic scales of operation can no longer be carried economically

3260766 we can shift behaviors in a matter of months or years
3260767 such an effort would require an enthusiastic participation of the advertising public relations and entertainment industries as well as organized religions and all major political parties
3260768 although the apparent crisis is about terrorism the real one is about energy scarcity an incisive account of the energy issue also explains the real functioning of the worlds economy and who controls it and how this shapes so much of our daily lives
3260769 no one can rationally say that the bush administration is incapable of lying
3260770 can we afford to not question the multitude of contradictions lies falsehoods and cover ups surrounding the events of 9 11
3260771 limits on the one resource that has propelled the human race to over expand and upon which the species is now dependent hydrocarbon energy an increasingly rapid stream of data and experience is ushering in what may be the most significant event in human history the end of the age of oil
3260772 there must be limitless growth into infinity for it to survive growth is not possible without energy there is nothing on our horizon other than wishful thinking that can completely replace hydrocarbon energy
3260773 if demand remains unchanged the world will run out of conventional oil within thirty five years
3260774 electricity is not a primary energy source but merely a carrier of energy produced by some other source
3260775 malthus was certainly correct but cheap oil skewed the equation over the past hundred years while the human race has enjoyed an unprecedented orgy of non renewable condensed solar energy
3260776 it most certainly is on life support and now being sustained by cruelty brute force and lies
3260777 for a 1982 three day orgy of killing and rape at the sabra and shatilla refugee camps that occurred when he led an invasion of lebanon
3260778 human rights violations in the jenin and nablus townships of the occupied territories in palestine
3260779 many were killed houses were bulldozed and people were left homeless and without food water or medical supplies in areas totally surrounded by israeli defense forces

3260793 while we are here in qingdao it is fantastic that we are able to visually communicate with the team on the ground back home from the heart of the olympic competition
3260794 although there is a team of sailors and support staff out here in china there is a significant team of people still in england who have played a key part in the build up to the games and will continue to do so throughout them we want everyone at rya hq to be part of our olympic experience and this vidyo technology enables us to share our unique insights and experiences and keep the whole team together even though we are thousands of miles apart
3260795 having worked with the rya for some time it became clear to us that what was needed was a rapid implementation of a high quality solution that allowed scalability and clear natural communications
3260796 taking into account the chinese firewall restrictions vidyo was our natural choice
3260797 the success of any team effort whether competing in the workplace or in the olympics greatly depends on easy access to clear and natural communications
3260798 the quality and simplicity of vidyoconferencing offers that competitive edge vidyo enables the rya to work seamlessly on their laptops and pcs across general purpose internet networks like adsl hotel wireless hotspots and 3g wireless networks what they see and hear must be precise and accurate and vidyo is able to deliver that high level of video and audio clarity were happy that we can play a small part in helping this capable team capture medals in qingdao

3260840 from today all noises of conversation shall cease if any man allows ramadan to be wasted it is a great sorrow indeed
3260841 during ramadan he used to emerge from his private resting place late in the morning in summer he generally came out at about ten oclock because he used to greatly increase his nafl salah tilawat of the quran and his moments of silence and meditation as compared with other months in this time he slept very little spoke very little and only retired after maghrib for a while to eat something initially he himself used to lead all twenty rakahs of taraweeh salaah but later performed it behind his son hafiz hakeem muhammad masood saheb after that he would perform two long rakaahs of nafl salaah sometimes standing up and sometimes sitting down and thereafter remained seated for a long time facing the qibla and reciting afterwards he would make one sajdah ut tilawah and stand up from hearing some of the word he recited softly i deduced that he recited surah mulk surah sajdah and surah dukhaan he usually fasted the ten days of dhul hijjah the days of ashura and the middle of shabaan

3260853 people used to constantly complain about windows mobiles lack of ability to work as a reliable alarm clock but that has now been fixed for the most part i find the iphone to be practically worthless at ever waking me up and keep going back to a reliable and loud nokia s60 device to serve as a trustworthy alarm basic functions like this used to be required for a device but we seem to let these issues slide today

3260864 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3260865 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3260866 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3260874 a bird delivered a message to me while i was gone it was pretty blurry though like the bird landed in a puddle or something
3260875 so our peace loving leader told you to tell us to advance and fight then why didnt ally mention it
3260876 she said she was just visiting us before she left to look for you
3260877 but if he puts her down like that again ill help you
3260878 help me out nami tell this idiot what you think
3260879 well maybe we could leave signs behind for her to follow
3260880 in the past ive been impatient to tackle many big projects at once im still ambitious but i prioritize so everything gets done in the right order
3260881 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3260882 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3260883 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3260884 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3260885 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3260899 the refugee crisis is an unacceptable cost of the governments mismanagement of the peace process a peace process should lead to the protection of life and property and yet whats happening is the opposite
3260900 the wfp fully understands that the situation remains fluid and we will continue to work closely with all concerned to further assess the total number of affected persons and adjust our response accordingly
3260901 wfp remains concerned over the growing number of persons displaced by the violence
3260902 many of the affected are women and children and we are concerned for their wellbeing and stand ready to support humanitarian needs
3260903 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity

3260918 we have reports that six people were killed it was near badaber
3260919 about 18 paf pakistan air force employees were traveling to the base when the bomb planted on the bridge went off
3260920 this was probably the hardest video ive ever done i ran up and down country lanes was struck by lightening set on fire and nearly drowned its amazing what youll do for music

3260926 the surgery was very successful in lining up the fractures and repairing the nail bed
3260927 not to use too much of a pun but i think we probably hit a home run putting it back together considering what the doctors said in cincinnati
3260928 it had been torn apart like a jigsaw puzzle that we put together
3260929 how is carlos if you need something let me know
3260930 then he told me they hit him in the hand and he was out of the game
3260931 we felt that if he had continued he could have possibly been mvp in the national league
3260932 ive said jeff bagwell was the heartbeat of the houston astros carlos has certainly been this years heartbeat of the houston astros and we will severely miss him you cant replace carlos lee
3260933 we were able to use the first option being able to line up the fracture without having to do too many incisions
3260934 he has two incisions but theyre very small were not planning another surgery
3260935 i think this is going to successfully treat the problem so that will be good the best case scenario if we had a little more time in the season we would probably try to push things
3260936 im so happy and calm now in your heart you feel its all going to be fine but until they tell you its over youre not calm

3260938 allein die abschw chung des euro kurses seit seinem hoch im juli d rfte das wirtschaftswachstum um 0 3 prozentpunkte steigern
3260939 wenn der lpreis in die spanne von 100 bis 110 dollar sinkt wird die ezb im zweiten quartal 2008 den leitzins senken
3260940 wenn die geschichte als leitfaden taugt dann findet der dollar gerade den boden
3260941 es hat sich gezeigt dass die konjunktur in den anderen l ndern sich rapide verschlechtert und die abkopplungsthese sich in luft aufl st
3260942 in der ersten jahresh lfte hat der anstieg der rohstoffpreise den dollar gedr ckt jetzt spielt sich das umgekehrt ab
3260943 wir hatten eigentlich gedacht der dollar bleibe aufgrund des schwachen zustands der us konjunktur anf llig f r neue tiefst nde
3260944 aber der markt hat abgestimmt und es sieht so aus als ob der dollar weiter zulegen werde
3260945 die heutige w hrungsbewegung hat uns gezwungen unsere auf dollar abwertung gerichteten spekulativen positionen aufzul sen
3260946 wir erwarten eine rezession sowohl im euro raum als auch in gro britannien
3260947 i am satisfied that what a neighbour heard was in fact patricia slipping as she was entering the bath
3260948 she hit her head on the back of the bath this caused her to lose consciousness it is likely that the amount of alcohol that she consumed would not have assisted her in recovering from her injuries
3260949 d j probably had as good an offseason as anybody in our program starting back in january and he carried that momentum through the summer
3260950 he probably had the best spring out of any of the backs thats pretty high praise for a guy who was a true freshman with the group of kids hes competing against
3260951 ive always had that competitive spirit when it comes to workouts
3260952 i knew after last year i had to step it up a lot and i knew i could i worked my butt off i think its going to pay off
3260953 when you look to your left and look to your right and see all these great athletes around
3260954 hes working hard and on top of that the boy can play football
3260955 die anleger sind unsicher wie es mit der europ ischen konjunktur und dem aktienmarkt weitergeht
3260956 die kursgewinne beim dollar sind an den lm rkten in den mittelpunkt ger ckt
3260957 der dax hat den starken r ckgang des lpreises bei weitem nicht komplett nachvollzogen
3260958 man sollte doch meinen dass unter diesen besonders g nstigen voraussetzungen ganz leicht noch viel mehr drin sein sollte
3260959 weve said as a group that we believe that thats making the eight now out of our control it really comes down to others winning and losing having an impact on where were going
3260960 were not even looking at the eight we saw the win last weekend in being the situation where that controlled our opportunity to make the eight and we lost that opportunity
3260961 so now its out of hands and in the hands of others
3260962 he had a plate put in there the radius bone above the wrist to stabilise the affected area on monday and he will miss the remainder of the season
3260963 brodie had worked hard to overcome his achilles injury and to have this happen at this time of year after battling through his rehabilitation for a long time is shocking luck
3260964 t hey dont think the economy is going to recover quickly
3260965 it is the funniest thing youve ever seen but also the most dangerous thing
3260966 the buses pass within a foot of each other on the t way and theres nowhere for cyclists or pedestrians to go
3260967 its only a matter of time before someone is killed
3260968 leveraged loans and unfunded commitments are difficult to hedge effectively and if market conditions further deteriorate additional markdowns may be necessary on this asset class
3260969 these mortgage exposures could be adversely affected by worsening market conditions further deterioration in the housing market and market activity reflecting distressed sellers

3260973 weve had x rays on it and the x rays showed it was ok but hes just feeling a bit of pain when hes running on it so we want to be a bit cautious about it
3260974 id rather go on the side of caution rather than trying to play him and making it worse and hes out for 6 10 weeks
3260975 hes an important part of our squad and hes our top scorer for the last couple of years so hell be putting pressure on people that will be playing
3260976 people come into this world not just as stomachs not just as consumers they come with brains and hands and they make contributions
3260977 whether you have enough resources elsewhere to keep you from withdrawing the money you put in the potentially 5 year deposit
3260978 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
3260979 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
3260980 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native
3260981 in my mind were not really pushing any environmental laws or rules its just a natural thing very natural to the farm
3260982 you might move them from one blueberry patch to another you might even move them out of the area
3260983 but falcons are a scare tactic and we always want to use an integrated approach
3260984 in the past only non indigenous birds could be employed
3260985 the main advantage to keeping one set fine throughout the entire city is it would eliminate the confusion that other ticket writers would have when it comes to the boundaries
3260986 you would have been amazed how many tcas and cpds and the occasional pea wrote the wrong violation for the cbd non cbd
3260987 the only other thing that may be involved is it would generate meter revenue tickets faster

3261000 we ship internationally everywhere in the world except the united states and its territories
3261001 as i write russia is waging war on my country
3261002 sometimes there are occasions when and we know from history there are different leaders who come to power either democratically or semi democratically and they become an obstacle
3261003 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3261004 i think we can look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3261005 i do think we have some very serious issues to face
3261006 fresh capital will strengthen their balance sheets and allow them to provide additional mortgage capital as they balance their responsibilities to their mission and to their shareholders

3261013 without fully employing its abilities even at the final moment the imperial nation is surrendering before the enemies propaganda
3261014 i never imagined the torpor of the nations leaders and people
3261015 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3261016 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation
3261017 the sacrifice of so many people who died in the war would go unrequited if this purpose remains unfulfilled
3261018 yes but the reason i am doing this is to be there for my family
3261019 the international community collectively held their breath waiting for the reaction of russia after the savage brutal criminal attack by georgia on south ossetia
3261020 after having offered a cease fire in hostilities the back stabbing georgians immediately violated the cease fire invading south ossetia and causing massive destruction and death among innocent civilians among peacekeepers and also destroying a hospital
3261021 russian moving towards tbilisi capital of georgia all bog towns are either bombed or taken by russians this is not peace keeping
3261022 bombs bombs bombs and more bombs 24 7 even when eu officials are in georgia russians still bombing our cities
3261023 russian media is feeding russians horse s t they have no idea whats goin in georgia cnn bbc or whatever news agency please say truth
3261024 been issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer
3261025 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3261026 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3261027 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3261028 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3261029 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007

3261033 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct

3261035 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3261036 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes

3261040 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3261041 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate

3261043 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare

3261084 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3261085 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3261086 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3261087 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3261088 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3261089 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3261090 but in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour

3261099 the sarah connor chronicles was a genuine surprise in the 2007 tv line up being both innovative and intriguing while operating within the tight constraints of a previously pre defined timeline
3261100 the season was cut short due to the writers strike but it certainly left me feeling like i wanted more in a good way the extras on this set are abundant and try to pull a quantity over quality equation on us the video could have been just a tad cleaner but the show alone is enough to make me recommend this three disc set
3261101 slick smart and stylish its a welcome addition to the canon of sci fi tv and sees summer glau making good on her breakout performances in firefly and serenity with a charismatic performance as cameron a terminator sent back from the year 2027 to protect john
3261102 although the series does not equal the greatness of t1 and t2 it does expand on the characters adding new twists as well as some key references to the films all in all its enough to satisfy fans old and new alike
3261103 the first two terminator movies were always something of a guilty pleasure of mine but when i heard the producers of the original franchise were making a series based on it i wasnt entirely sure how it would work out i was pleasantly surprised

3261119 house proud nineteenth century watercolor interiors from the thaw collection
3261120 the watercolors are the most important gift to the museums drawings prints and graphic design department in 30 years and will provide an invaluable reference for all four of the museums collecting departments
3261121 the drawings will allow a fuller reading of the 19th century objects in the museums collection heighten interdepartmental connections and inform and stimulate new acquisitions across the museum
3261122 draw your pleasure paint your pleasure and express your pleasure strongly
3261123 rarely has an artist packed a museum with so much visual excitement
3261124 you still see companies executing doing well coming in better than expectations
3261125 it seems that the good news is really being kind of overshadowed by high oil prices
3261126 the fear is that higher oil prices might drive us into that recessionary area
3261127 this market after having had a pretty rough last week is prone to drawing in some more value seekers
3261128 a little more manic and psych y but they never go quite as far as obviously influences akron family or animal collective
3261129 i think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you
3261130 indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not tell me that you intended to go into harness
3261131 i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl
3261132 this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as i have changed my clothes i cant imagine how you deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it out
3261133 my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his top hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession
3261134 the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good as yours
3261135 you see but you do not observe the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room
3261136 quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps because i have both seen and observed by the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this
3261137 there will call upon you to night at a quarter to eight oclock
3261138 a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment
3261139 i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself what do you deduce from it
3261140 the man who wrote it was presumably well to do
3261141 such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff
3261142 it is not an english paper at all hold it up to the light
3261143 the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather
3261144 not at all the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a customary contraction like our co p of course stands for papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental gazetteer
3261145 eglow eglonitz here we are egria it is in a german speaking country in bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills ha ha my boy what do you make of that
3261146 precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence this account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts
3261147 a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece theres money in this case watson if there is nothing else
3261148 not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it
3261149 never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention
3261150 this is my friend and colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases whom have i the honor to address
3261151 you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honor and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate with you alone
3261152 you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me
3261153 by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon european history
3261154 the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is not exactly my own
3261155 the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia
3261156 i am the king why should i attempt to conceal it
3261157 your majesty had not spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein grand duke of cassel felstein and hereditary king of bohemia
3261158 you can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting you
3261159 the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the wellknown adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you
3261160 hum born in new jersey in the year 1858 contralto hum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera of warsaw yes retired from operatic stage ha living in london quite so your majesty as i understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back
3261161 then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity
3261162 oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion
3261163 i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now
3261164 five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice she has been waylaid there has been no result
3261165 very indeed and what does she propose to do with the photograph
3261166 to clotilde lothman von saxe meningen second daughter of the king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
3261167 threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not go none
3261168 you are sure that she has not sent it yet
3261169 because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday
3261170 that is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in london for the present
3261171 certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm
3261172 then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress
3261173 i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph
3261174 there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes
3261175 then good night your majesty and i trust that we shall soon have some good news for you and good night watson
3261176 if you will be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three oclock i should like to chat this little matter over with you
3261177 its quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i employed my morning or what i ended by doing
3261178 i cant imagine i suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler
3261179 i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange twopence a glass of half and half two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood in whom i was not in the least interested but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to
3261180 oh she has turned all the mens heads down in that part
3261181 this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge or turn my attention to the gentlemans chambers in the temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the situation
3261182 i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out
3261183 he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting room pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms
3261184 away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only half buttoned and his tie under his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles
3261185 the church of st monica john she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes
3261186 come man come only three minutes or it wont be legal
3261187 well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church door however they separated he driving back to the temple and she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove away in different directions and i went off to make my own arrangements
3261188 i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want your cooperation
3261189 when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you now
3261190 i must discuss it while i eat for i have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her
3261191 you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must not interfere come what may you understand
3261192 to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the sitting room window will open you are to station yourself close to that open window
3261193 you are to watch me for i will be visible to you
3261194 and when i raise my hand so you will throw into the room what i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire you quite follow me
3261195 it is an ordinary plumbers smoke rocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it self lighting your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten minutes i hope that i have made myself clear
3261196 i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street
3261197 that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play
3261198 this marriage rather simplifies matters the photograph becomes a double edged weapon now the chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess now the question is where are we to find the photograph
3261199 it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a womans dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we may take it then that she does not carry it about with her
3261200 her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house
3261201 she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter
3261202 but hell be gone before you can get him to hospital
3261203 they would have had the ladys purse and watch if it hadnt been for him they were a gang and a rough one too ah hes breathing now
3261204 he cant lie in the street may we bring him in marm
3261205 surely bring him into the sitting room there is a comfortable sofa this way please
3261206 the matter was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening
3261207 then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick
3261208 then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else could she do and into her sitting room which was the very room which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance
3261209 it was all important when a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box now it was clear to me that our lady of to day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull she was there in an instant and i caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out when i cried out that it was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait a little over precipitance may ruin all
3261210 our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king to morrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands
3261211 at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to the king without delay
3261212 now i wonder who the deuce that could have been
3261213 because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your majestys plan
3261214 it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own station what a queen she would have made
3261215 indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she left this morning with her husband by the 5 15 train from charing cross for the continent
3261216 did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen is it not a pity that she was not on my level
3261217 from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty
3261218 i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majestys business to a more successful conclusion
3261219 nothing could be more successful i know that her word is inviolate the photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire
3261220 your majesty has something which i should value even more highly
3261221 i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the matter i have the honor to wish you a very good morning

3261227 look at three things and you wont come to sin where you are going to the grave ethics of the fathers 3 1 ethics of the fathers does not say where you will be going in the future but where you are already going from the time we are born we begin a journey whose destination is our eventual death and entry into the afterlife thats why we must make the most out of every single day of our lives as the talmud states rabbi eliezer said repent one day before your death his students asked him does a person know when his day of death will occur he answered them then he should repent today perhaps he will die tomorrow thus all his days will be full of repentance this is what king solomon said in kohelet 9 8 your clothing should be white at all times there is an allegory which illustrates this a king invited his servants to a grand feast but did not inform them when the feast was to transpire the smart ones dressed in their finest clothes and prepared themselves by waiting outside the palaces entrance the foolish ones remained in their common clothes and continued to engage in their own pursuits thinking they had plenty of time suddenly the king asked for all to attend and only the smart ones were asked to sit eat drink and enjoy

3261253 we dont have to talk about ourselves to pump ourselves up and things like that
3261254 weve just got to go about our business and thats exactly what deans done he has done a fantastic job
3261255 without fully employing its abilities even at the final moment the imperial nation is surrendering before the enemies propaganda
3261256 i never imagined the torpor of the nations leaders and people
3261257 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3261258 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation

3261273 the cost of this shift which was the main thing i was concerned about to the public hospitals would be about 360 million a year he said
3261274 in a system which costs i think last year it cost 26 billion itll be about 27 billion this year thats trivial
3261275 i do not consider 360 million a year to be a trivial amount and im sure most australians would agree mr hockey said in a statement
3261276 increased petrol and grocery prices are already putting pressure on australians 70 may seem like a small amount but for those on a fixed income it can make a real difference

3261314 weve already sold the same amount of wood this month alone
3261315 and weve increased the amount for sale by 70 cords this season

3261379 elite clientele a professionally managed platform to bid for prime property
3261380 the success of the auction highlights the confidence that international investors have in the sustainability of the dubai property market
3261381 certain properties in dubai have a significant demand in the market as these are not only prime properties but also provide an exclusive lifestyle environment only a limited number of units were offered for sale only six plots in emirates hills and 12 golf homes
3261382 each market and development will have to be assessed separately and decisions on auction will be taken
3261383 as the laws got transparent and stronger on ownership and titles and in 3 to 5 years when sales have steadied a bit auctions will become more important
3261384 the reason they are seen as a gimmick today is because there are so few of them but i think auctions will eventually come to individual villas and apartments because there is a market for that
3261385 auction has been confined to an exclusive club here but in countries such as uk australia and new zealand it is one of 2 or 3 ways of selling you have got a tender process you have got auction and you have got the traditional open market
3261386 sale activity takes place as approved by the board of directors and comes as part of an overall strategy for restructuring the portfolio of rental properties

3261389 its not surprising that auckland is finding itself very much at the epicentre of the current economic recession and in particular the continued fallout from the finance sector collapses and its therefore understandable that confidence in the auckland residential market at this point is pretty low

3261395 im not so sure your alien currency will work here
3261396 a small step for man a giant leap for mankind
3261397 i am here on work it is something i try to shirk i am doing this story on solar system and there is a 5 eon segment just after the break on earth there is very little interest about earth among our viewers this is primarily because bipeds walking around dont make good stories like supernovas exploding and black hole discovery expeditions however we feel there is a lot of story potential if we understand how you manage yourselves we have been sending some low cost ships for centuries now but cant figure out a thing so we decided to talk to some of you
3261398 your first two sentences rhyme the rest of them dont
3261399 oh our grammar is like that defying it means death by eating a hat
3261400 oh so you have been talking to other people i thought we had something special going on here
3261401 so have you i can name a few you are best friends with mazzy crasha she is from the third planet to the right of the blue blackhole right in front of the frozen comet
3261402 oh you have been keeping a watch on me have you
3261403 was she doing some weird alien psychological experiment on me
3261404 she is a human she broke up with you because you are a jerk
3261405 that is an excellent place to begin i often see humans sucking at the stick and emitting smoke through their mouths is this in the memory of the dragons that died out about 26 000 years ago
3261406 no its not its a habit its something people do to feel good
3261407 it is something you do again and again and again and again
3261408 because its a habit you start doing it and you get used to it then you have got to do it
3261409 you just pick the best things and keep doing them what a wonderful idea
3261410 err well actually cigarettes are bad for people they kill
3261411 why smoke then he asked i could see he genuinely wanted to know
3261412 so its okay if themselves people kill encourage it on earth here you will
3261413 no actually if you try to kill yourself you could go to jail
3261414 whats a jail in understanding that i fail but wait we will get to that so if people smoke they have consequences like the jail thing
3261415 no only if you try to kill yourself er like if you jump from a building or if you slash your wrists or something if you dont die you go to jail cigarettes dont kill at once so its okay
3261416 oh the pace of dying determines if its a crime suddenly is bad slowly is fine
3261417 i dont know why i am feeling tense this just doesnt make mathematical sense
3261418 dont worry about it its my head its clouded in thought
3261419 pardon me if my understanding of your world is lowly but how do people get these smoking sticks that kill slowly
3261420 it is the most amazing thing to be able to state the obvious
3261421 pardon me if my understanding of your world is lowly but how do people get these smoking sticks that kill slowly
3261422 its available in shops its produced in factories and sold to these shops
3261423 it is the factory that produces each to the factories how does it reach
3261424 people make cigarettes in factories other people own these factories
3261425 but surely they know that cigarettes end life someones son daughter friend or wife
3261426 its not like that they do it to earn money money is important they want others to be happy and well but only those whom they know and like
3261427 so people killing people is okay with earthlings in fact this is one of their favorite things
3261428 no no like i said before only if u kill somebody like shoot them or murder them its a crime smoking doesnt kill immediately and at once i thought we had an understanding on this
3261429 it is behind time that the killers hide sell smoking sticks for 20 years and you have a genocide
3261430 dont you guys have any habits like smoking and stuff
3261431 you are currently using 2865 mb 99 of your 2883 mb
3261432 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3261433 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3261435 brodie had worked hard to overcome his achilles injury and to have this happen at this time of year after battling through his rehabilitation for a long time is shocking luck
3261436 weve said as a group that we believe that thats making the eight now out of our control it really comes down to others winning and losing having an impact on where were going
3261437 were not even looking at the eight we saw the win last weekend in being the situation where that controlled our opportunity to make the eight and we lost that opportunity
3261438 so now its out of hands and in the hands of others
3261439 weve had x rays on it and the x rays showed it was ok but hes just feeling a bit of pain when hes running on it so we want to be a bit cautious about it
3261440 id rather go on the side of caution rather than trying to play him and making it worse and hes out for 6 10 weeks
3261441 hes an important part of our squad and hes our top scorer for the last couple of years so hell be putting pressure on people that will be playing

3261490 ten dead bodies and 11 injured have been brought here said khan abbas a police official sent to the citys main lady reading hospital
3261491 been issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer
3261492 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3261493 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3261494 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3261495 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3261496 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007
3261497 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3261498 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate
3261499 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct
3261500 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3261501 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3261502 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3261503 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3261504 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare

3261512 the international community collectively held their breath waiting for the reaction of russia after the savage brutal criminal attack by georgia on south ossetia
3261513 after having offered a cease fire in hostilities the back stabbing georgians immediately violated the cease fire invading south ossetia and causing massive destruction and death among innocent civilians among peacekeepers and also destroying a hospital
3261514 russian moving towards tbilisi capital of georgia all bog towns are either bombed or taken by russians this is not peace keeping
3261515 bombs bombs bombs and more bombs 24 7 even when eu officials are in georgia russians still bombing our cities
3261516 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3261517 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3261518 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3261519 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3261520 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3261521 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3261522 russian peacekeepers and military units attached to them have been taking action to prevent georgia from shelling south ossetia and russian peacekeepers
3261523 to be tied for most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history and the olympics have been around for so many years its a pretty amazing accomplishment

3261532 i wanted to be canadas first medal of the games because i heard today going out on the bus that we hadnt won a medal yet
3261533 everybody asked me what do you think of this one compared to 1984 but 1984 was in l a so not many people were there
3261534 today here i feel like im back home everybody calling me name they still remember me im so happy to be here in beijing
3261535 today i really focused on the race and not the outcome
3261536 we started to pull away next thing we know australias in our lane
3261537 in 10 years of rowing ive never seen anything like that its just bizarre all of sudden we saw them coming over and they just about hit the back of our boat
3261538 brents lead off time really charged us up for swimming fast
3261539 this is a huge step for us and being under world record pace has proved that we belong here
3261540 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him
3261541 he sent a personal message asking her to get on board
3261542 its a very sad day to lose him he knew about the business he knew about television he was responsible for what i think was the golden age of bbc television which well never have again
3261543 he knew what the public wanted and he gave the public what they wanted
3261544 he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us absolutely to the hilt

3261599 were not confident in their ability to diagnose and manage hepatitis c infection
3261600 approximately 500 000 people in the uk are thought to be living with hepatitis c of these 90 per cent dont know they are infected
3261601 hepatitis c is a major cause of chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and liver cancer patients can live for many years without experiencing symptoms and as a consequence a large number remain undiagnosed
3261602 more must be done to equip gps so they can correctly identify those who should be offered a hepatitis c test and then interpret any result correctly
3261603 the analysis is carried out by an expert in a laboratory and the results will then be passed back to the doctor who can tell the patient
3261604 if there is a clear cut result whether a patient is infected or not that will be passed on if it is an equivocal result they might recommend a further test
3261605 gps may lack experience in these tests but they are certainly not left alone when it comes to interpreting them

3261610 sponsorship of the camping world rv 400 sprint cup race and the year round partnership with dover international speedway compliments our growing nascar program
3261611 the dover fan base includes one of the largest weekend rv communities on the circuit and we are looking forward to helping enhance their weekend camping and racing experience
3261612 this sponsorship program will assist us in introducing our brand to the outdoor enthusiasts in the area which is important to us as our future plans include opening a permanent camping world store in close proximity to the speedway
3261613 through its extensive involvement in nascar camping world has become one of the premier companies in the sport today
3261614 were excited about this new partnership and the added benefits it provides race fans at the track on race weekend dover is known to be a popular destination for rv travelers on the nascar circuit and camping world will provide convenient access like never before
3261615 i think its cowardly to cheat in sport but its even more cowardly not to admit it
3261616 before the tour i made a mistake i took a product that everyone is talking about
3261617 i came here and i have explained the error i made i think you all know 13 days ago the position that i was in i think i have made a good gesture for everyone to have admitted my mistakes
3261618 during the tour they made a lot of tests they made 10 tests in about 13 legs two were positive and in fact in theory all the tests should have been positive therefore the method needs to be checked
3261619 i came to the antidoping prosecutor for me to relieve a burden because i feel at fault and an obligation to apologize to my fans
3261620 my thoughts are with the team because people have lost their jobs because of me i also think my teammates who always because of me had to renounce to continue their adventure in the tour
3261621 the information that a special molecule has been added to mircera is wrong
3261622 wada received the molecule well in advance and was able to develop ways to detect it including through the current epo detection method
3261623 roche has provided samples of mircera and assay reagents to the world anti doping agency wada to help ensure that wada laboratories will be able to carry out reliable anti doping testing
3261624 mircera can be differentiated in samples from both naturally occurring erythropoeitin and from all other traditional esa products erythropoeisis stimulating agents ed
3261625 the molecule is designed to assist in advancing the management of chronic kidney disease not detection of illegal use
3261626 i am delighted to know that after a long period of 15 years you have triumphed over the despair of rheumatoid arthritis and are showing encouraging signs of recovery with this resilience and spirit i am sure that the day isnt far when you will be able to walk again and come to meet me at rashtrapati bhavan periods of adversity in life are testing times for us do not regret the opportunities you have missed due to your illness you should always look ahead for what you can do for yourself and for others like you who face adversity
3261627 i am moved and grateful that the president wrote to me there are so many people like me yet she has shown such concern towards me i do hope i can walk into rashtrapati bhavan and meet her
3261628 for the past 15 years my world was full of just pain and helplessness with this crippling disease all i could do was sit or lie down on my bed and take a few faltering painful steps to go to the toilet it was a very depressing state of affairs for my family and me and many times i would wonder what is the point of existing like this
3261629 i also look forward to the day when this brave girl seema is able to walk normally and go about her daily chores with ease she is a highly intelligent sensitive and caring person and deserves all the best in life
3261630 when seema first came to fortis she was bedridden and wheel chair bound and severely depressed because of her compromised quality of life at such a young age the young 37 year old lady weighed only 40 kg her case was complex because she had multiple joint involvement her bones were severely fragile and osteoporotic her joints had lost mobility and were fixed and her muscles were atomic and weak because she had been immobile for many years it was a very challenging and rare case indeed
3261631 i would like to advise anyone who is facing an equally serious situation anywhere in the world to not waste time move with a positive attitude and seek medical help wherever he or she is medical science has made tremendous strides and can be of great help do not let doubts or misgivings stop you from bringing sunshine back into your life
3261632 all i could think about was that i had to raise my level for the games
3261633 i could feel it in my body that it was working i think its cowardly to cheat in sport but its even more cowardly not to admit it
3261634 i know all the sacrifices i have made in the world there are cheats and there always will be cheats there are also people who know how to sacrifice and who know how to do the work in a clean way in our generation and in our society we cannot eliminate the cheaters we can only fight hard to reduce them
3261635 see we were right he is a no good cheat
3261636 though his gusevs results do not indicate the use of forbidden substances vladimirs values exceeded the normal parameters established by dr damsgaard and were not compliant with the strict agreement signed by all thirty riders our kazakh sponsors have also been made aware of this decision and are fully supportive
3261637 its impossible for any team manager to know the activities of riders behind closed doors but we continue to enforce that team astana has a 100 percent no tolerance policy and any violators will serve the same fate as vladimir on a brighter note this proves that dr damsgaards system works and we are committed to racing clean
3261638 the names riis and frank schleck of course we are aware
3261639 not only are we a clean team but well get rid of valued riders who even have the faintest whiff of a scandal dangling around their necks like an unwelcome albatross
3261640 i have urged jessica to have any supplement vitamin etc that she has consumed to be tested for purity
3261641 having said that in 30 years of coaching i have never encouraged and have generally discouraged my athletes of taking supplements of any kind
3261642 the community of athletes elite and otherwise do believe in the benefit of supplements and in fact many coaches often prescribe such supplements with the expectations of better training recovery
3261643 the worse fears may be realized in this circumstance as it pertains to jessica i e the supplement industry runs unabated without any controls jessica has come by her results with honest committed hard work
3261644 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3261645 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3261646 forms part of the ongoing investigation and the cause of the fire remains unknown
3261647 i have every confidence in the investigation being carried out jointly between the police the fire service and insurers and i am sure we will all know exactly what happened in due course
3261648 this years carfax 250 will be the best yet in its three year history
3261649 we get to make a wish come true for eric a nascar and country music lover who kicks off the race with pat green nascar fans will be treated to an electrifying race and fun filled day that brings out the kid in all of us
3261650 that nefarious piepoli conned the poor na ve waif ricc into using the bug juice its all his fault our golden child fell from grace
3261651 we do not accept and we strongly condemn the choice made by riders seeking victory through deception
3261652 therefore we would not like this incident to stain the teams impeccable reputation or ours or the managements
3261653 we are not ready to pay the price for the mistakes made by others so he hope we can still rely on the trust society has always had in us stemming from our serious honest image
3261654 we cannot and do not want to ignore the facts cheaters need to be punished but we also believe that those who have always fought honestly to defend the honour of the team should be protected
3261655 well stay cautious and wait to see the outcome of the trial in norwich popcorn can upset some of our customers but most are happy with it and want popcorn
3261656 it is a political decision in that do we want to upset 100 people by banning it or two people by keeping it i think it may be different for each cinema and the decision will be made site by site
3261657 popcorn is a contentious issue lots of people absolutely hate it and have asked us to ban it so were going to do exactly that
3261658 i can understand why they are doing it popcorn is more for mainstream cinemas i was at a film the other day and there was a man sitting next to me who was eating popcorn through the whole movie
3261659 in france for example they wouldnt dream of selling popcorn in some cinemas but some people do enjoy it and see it as part of the whole experience of going to the cinema
3261660 but it is great to relax with some popcorn some of our members like it and some dont i wouldnt mind either way
3261661 we are delighted to be able to keep water bills this low even with this increase our bills are still 20 lower than most people are paying today tuesday 12 august
3261662 our customers saw the lowest bill increases of all water and wastewater companies when prices were set back in 2005
3261663 where people can enjoy woods meadows wetlands and a whole wealth of wildlife right on their doorstep
3261664 we actually had a walk around with the wildlife trust 18 months ago to discuss what could be done to make the site more accessible but they have done none of what we discussed
3261665 they have laid shingle in the car park which is impossible to push a wheelchair through and is equally hard for mothers with pushchairs
3261666 added to that they havent put a path through the muddy bridleway to allow wheelchair users to make it to the fishing platform which was specially designed for the disabled to use so now they cant get to it
3261667 the excuse is always money but they have had quite a lot to do this project
3261668 i want the work done to the standard they promised and allow us to get to the park and fishing platform so that we can be equal
3261669 its about having some respect and doing as they should there is no point in asking us what we need if they are not going to act on it
3261670 following discussions with local residents and disability cambridgeshire the wildlife trust has made improvements to access within cambourne
3261671 the bill followed a meter reading in january and was backdated to 2003
3261672 the power firm involved e on told us that the previous readings both estimated and physically read had been taken as cubic metres where the meter actually worked in cubic feet
3261673 our first reaction was that this should make the bill less but apparently cubic feet are recorded in tens meaning there had been an under payment
3261674 initially the bill was almost 19 000 but an updated one arrived a few days later amending it to 15 558 which was taken from our account under the debit scheme
3261675 it was as people can imagine quite a blow to us as a charity we rely totally on donations from the public to fund our work and this money could have been very useful elsewhere
3261676 we originally wrote off the 15 558 we paid as unavoidable but the stories in the news have made us wonder if this was indeed the case
3261677 we have spoken to the animal centre and have apologised for the error
3261678 if youve got no other risk factors for cardiovascular disease a level of 160 milligrammes mg or less per 100 millilitres ml of blood is normal

3261684 the symptoms are clearly of viral fever and jaundice and on sunday we examined about 100 patients in muktapur and also distributed medicines a majority of the sick people are children
3261685 instead of visiting the government hospital which is barely three kilometres from the village they villagers rely on quacks who give wrong and expired medicines
3261686 two pumps were installed about five years ago and one of them went out of order soon we have no other source of drinking water and because there are no arrangements to draining out water from the village the remaining pump is giving dirty water
3261687 the move was long overdue we have been facing a lot of problems while treating burn injuries
3261688 now with the forthcoming specialised units we will be able to offer such facilities
3261689 now they feel that school is over all they want to do is watch tv or just lay back on the computer and eat

3261694 in the case of mircera cera thanks to the cooperation of the manufacturer of this substance roche and of wada accredited laboratories wada received the molecule well in advance and was able to develop ways to detect it
3261695 this case shows the significant work that wada conducts in anticipating doping trends including by closely cooperating with pharmaceutical companies at very early stages of the development of molecules or substances for therapeutic purposes to develop detection methods for anti doping purposes
3261696 this is a big occasion to put an end to the disputes
3261697 there is a project to involve all the families of cycling the uci is most welcome to be a part of this project we dont want to go outside of the sporting institution
3261698 notes that the teams have once again succumbed to pressure from the management of aso whose aim for the last four years has been to destroy the uci protour
3261699 they face exclusion from the international federation and thats something we are going to discuss
3261700 it is obvious they are going to join asos dissident federation
3261701 the problem is that we were sold a product the protour which is not the one we got
3261702 thats the origin of the conflict what matters today for my sponsors is a participation in the three big tours
3261703 if it happens 30 percent of the teams staff will be without a job
3261704 its bad news for cycling and teams who will have to reduce their staff
3261705 if the three big tour organisers share the cake between them they have enough races without us we might as well die
3261706 the pro tour is a great idea in principal with the best teams in the best races in the world
3261707 but when theres a war going on you have to choose a side the teams strength lies in their unity now its up to others to come to the table and talk
3261708 there were some good things in the pro tour but where is it leading to if the giro tour and vuelta are not even part of the series

3261710 corry has one of the most beautiful timbres in pop music the majority of todays pop bands play safe with the sound and the melodies of yesterday soft targets succeeds in finding new ones and the most beautiful ones the result is flawless the true pop break of this year

3261715 even though nikhil didnt quite have a great outing with salaam e ishq we must remember that he is the same man who made kal ho na ho with chandni chowk to china he has changed genre yet again and opted for an action comedy entertainer moreover akshays name is good enough to excite an audience
3261716 yes tashan was an exception but if one looks closely even akshay was guarded during the films promotion he is a smart man and probably knew which way the film was headed for thats the reason there wasnt much hue and cry even though he was the best part about the film also one must remember that yash raj films traditionally do not go for a publicity overdrive whereas vipul shah made sure that singh is kinng was the talk of the town akshay chipped in a big way as well to the films promotional plan and as everyone can see history has been made
3261717 it is as simple as that if you find akshay talking about the film through all avenues possible and genuinely promoting it in a big way be rest assured that he is excited about the film
3261718 akshay knows that he is a huge brand and there is a responsibility which comes with his spoken words audiences dote on him and he will never want to hurt them by talking big about a poor product in any case chandni chowk is a well made film and thats the very reason why trade is mighty excited about it
3261719 lawson could play a big role in calming down the fears off may about players playing in pakistan and i think he has made that effort because he sincerely believes that teams must support pakistan cricket and sports by playing in the country
3261720 you gravitated towards those primarily responsible because they offered you friendship you were easily taken in and manipulated by them
3261721 i accept that there was no significant monetary benefit for you as a result of your assistance to them nevertheless these are serious offences that you have committed
3261722 it is my view that as a result of that combination of circumstances that you are unlikely to offend again

3261745 no puedo decir en los ltimos a os en los ltimos meses s porque nos han dejado trabajar en paz no nos han exigido que fuera a ninguna concentraci n yo creo que la nataci n espa ola es buena y tiene muy buenos nadadores el problema es que hace falta un poco m s de confianza no solo cuando van bien las cosas sino tambi n antes de que las cosas vayan bien
3261746 cuando un nadador ve que las cosas van bien le dan apoyo y todo lo que se mueve a su alrededor es felicidad pues eso autom ticamente de hace nadar m s r pido
3261747 estoy contento pero ha sido una pena porque ayer tuve un poquito de fiebre pero todav a he tenido suerte y no me he puesto malo como erika villaecija o como otros compa eros alemanes que se han puesto malos al llegar aqu y eso es una pena
3261748 son los cambios de temperatura subes al bus y el aire acondicionado est a toda pastilla entras en el comedor igual y hay cambios de temperatura de 15 grados o m s y eso es bastante perjudicial

3261770 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3261771 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well

3261778 theyre only as daring as their target demographic allows them to be
3261779 its a lot harder to be bold and daring when youre designing something for a more middle class larger group of people i see it all the time at school someone designs something ridiculously expensive and their target market board is filled with shots of young incredibly rich people cut out from magazines

3261782 why harry potter became a phenomenon while artemis fowl only remains a huge sensation is a conundrum for future ages to ponder
3261783 once we were off and running with the other books we got a lot of feedback internally
3261784 people asked why arent we doing all three were giving them the same attention
3261785 the original vision at the heart of shared worlds has always been the desire to provide a place where oddball kids like me could get together and play with ideas
3261786 bent only played at the end of last season but tottenham paid a lot of money to sign him and two years ago he was a very important player at charlton
3261787 baldini told me he played very well so we will have to wait and see
3261788 the most important games will be played on sunday so it is dangerous
3261789 we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it
3261790 spain were the best team at the euros they won because they played with confidence
3261791 the other countries played with a lot of spirit and the level of their players was good but we are at the same level or better
3261792 we have to play with spirit and we have to play with confidence it is down to me to transmit it
3261793 henrik larsson had left barcelona before i arrived two years ago and i didnt have the opportunity to speak to him
3261794 but gio van bronckhorst told me about the city and it was good advice
3261795 i asked for advice and he advised me as a friend not as a fan
3261796 he told me that glasgow is a very nice city and that i would have no problems in adapting
3261797 he also said that celtic are a very good team and it would be like home here
3261798 but i had heard of celtic they are a good name in spanish football
3261799 we watch a lot of british football in spain and celtic are well known
3261800 the fact that there was 60 000 there and cheering for me was amazing
3261801 it was unbelievable you could see from my face i was a bit scared
3261802 i want to repay that by playing well for the club
3261803 im grateful to the fans and my team mates who have made it easy for me to integrate quickly
3261804 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3261805 this is a planning took where all things are going
3261806 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3261807 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3261808 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3261809 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3261810 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3261811 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3261812 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3261813 the other countries played with a lot of spirit and the level of their players was good but we are at the same level or better
3261814 we have to play with spirit and we have to play with confidence it is down to me to transmit it
3261815 the players believe in themselves that is why they have improved every game
3261816 we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it
3261817 they played with spirit and pride in their country they have patriotism they are a good team who play on the counter attack very well and they have quality in midfield and in their forwards but i think we are ready to win against croatia
3261818 the most important games will be played on sunday so it is dangerous
3261819 i will announce the captain a day before the game
3261820 i will speak with the captain just a moment before i tell the rest of the squad then everyone else will find out
3261821 maybe i should just listen to roy oswalt and have it cut off
3261822 the surgery was very successful in lining up the fractures and repairing the nail bed
3261823 not to use too much of a pun but i think we probably hit a home run putting it back together considering what the doctors said in cincinnati
3261824 it had been torn apart like a jigsaw puzzle that we put together
3261825 how is carlos if you need something let me know
3261826 then he told me they hit him in the hand and he was out of the game
3261827 we felt that if he had continued he could have possibly been mvp in the national league
3261828 ive said jeff bagwell was the heartbeat of the houston astros carlos has certainly been this years heartbeat of the houston astros and we will severely miss him you cant replace carlos lee
3261829 we were able to use the first option being able to line up the fracture without having to do too many incisions
3261830 he has two incisions but theyre very small were not planning another surgery
3261831 i think this is going to successfully treat the problem so that will be good the best case scenario if we had a little more time in the season we would probably try to push things
3261832 im so happy and calm now in your heart you feel its all going to be fine but until they tell you its over youre not calm

3261837 that everyone wants to live on top of the mountain but that all the happiness and growth occurs while youre climbing it
3261838 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go thats a hundred times better than watching on tv
3261839 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it make sure i was well prepared but i do not want to sit there watching it wondering what could have happened
3261840 it gives me a mental lift to have got this far because to be honest if they had told me the bleakest medical diagnosis which came out in dribs and drabs in the end i might have said this is not going to happen
3261841 and there were times in the last 12 weeks when i thought how can this be happening has someone put a jinx on me
3261842 but then id go to bed and think no this is the olympics im not going to give up
3261843 and gary lough her husband and coach said to me someone is testing you to see how much you want it
3261844 it certainly means i have a lot of unfinished business with the olympics but i also think the olympics are something more special anyway
3261845 it was my dream as a little girl you dont dream about world championships you dream about the olympics
3261846 but regardless of what happened four years ago this still would have been something i fought for
3261847 i have not taken stupid risks with my leg but at every point i
3261848 you have to ask yourself are you prepared for the worst thing that can happen and for me the worst thing is not to be able to finish the race and i have already faced that in athens
3261849 there have been points when i really did not think i would make it so i will be the happiest of all the runners on the start line
3261850 the only reason i would not able to finish it would be if my leg could not handle it but i have been encouraged as my leg has been coping with good amounts of running

3261869 what is taking place now is not unexpected the russian federation as you recall on many occasions drew attention to the dangerous situation which was evolving around south ossetia the russian federation on many occasions drew attention to the fact that georgia was increasing at an increasing rate its offensive weapons georgia is the world record holder in the increase of its military budget which over recent years has grown by thirty times and now we understand what the purpose of all this was

3261966 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3261967 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3261968 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3261969 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3261970 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3261971 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean
3261972 hai orang orang yang beriman apabila kamu hendak mengerjakan shalat maka basuhlah mukamu dan tanganmu sampai dengan siku dan sapulah kepalamu dan basuh kakimu sampai dengan kedua mata kaki dan jika kamu junub maka mandilah dan jika kamu sakit atau dalam perjalanan atau kembali dari tempat buang air kakus atau menyentuh perempuan lalu kamu tidak memperoleh air maka bertayamumlah dengan tanah yang baik bersih sapulah mukamu dan tanganmu dengan tanah itu allah tidak hendak menyulitkan kamu tetapi dia hendak membersihkan kamu dan menyempurnakan nikmat nya bagimu supaya kamu bersyukur
3261973 allah tidak akan menerima shalat salah seorang di antaramu jika berhadats sehingga berwudhu
3261974 tidakkah aku tunjukkan kepadamu tentang amal yang menghapus kesalahan dan meninggikan kedudukan
3261975 menyempurnakan wudhu dalam kondisi yang tidak menyenangkan memperbanyak langkah ke masjid menunggu shalat setelah shalat itulah ribath itulah ribath itulah ribath
3261976 jika tidak akan memberatkan umatku akan aku perintahkan mereka bersiwak setiap kali berwudhu
3261977 aku melihat rasulullah saw tidak terhitung jumlahnya bersiwak dalam keadaan berpuasa
3261978 aku melihat rasulullah saw berwudhu dan membasuh kedua tangannya tiga kali
3261979 rasulullah saw sangat menyukai memulai dari yang kanan ketika memakai sandal menyisir bersuci dan semua aktivitasnya
3261980 sesungguhnya umatku akan datang di hari kiamat dalam keadaan putih berseri dari basuhan wudhu
3261981 tidak ada seorangpun di antara kalian yang berwudhu dan menyempurnakannya kemudian berdoa aku bersaksi bahwa tiada tuhan yang berhak disembah selain allah maha esa tiada sekutu bagi nya dan aku bersaksi bahwa nabi muhammad adalah hamba dan utusan nya pasti akan dibukakan baginya pintu pintu surga yang delapan itu dan dipersilahkan masuk dari mana saja
3261982 tidak ada seorangpun yang berwudhu dan menyempurnakan wudhunya kemudian shalat dua rakaat dengan menghadap wajah dan hatinya maka wajib baginya surga
3261983 atau kembali dari tempat buang air kakus atau menyentuh perempuan
3261984 allah tidak menerima shalat salah seorang di antaramu ketika berhadats sehingga ia berwudhu
3261985 rasulullah saw pernah menyuruh kami jika dalam perjalanan untuk tidak melepas sepatu kami selama tiga hari tiga malam sebab buang air kecil air besar maupun tidur kecuali karena junub
3261986 adalah para sahabat rasulullah saw pada masa nabi menunggu shalat isya sehingga kepala mereka tertunduk kemudian mereka shalat tanpa berwudhu
3261987 barangsiapa yang muntah atau mengeluarkan darah maka berpaling dan berwudhulah
3261988 saya tidur di hadapan rasulullah dan kakiku ada di arah kiblatnya jika ia hendak sujud ia memindahkan kakiku
3261989 kecuali karena tertawa terbahak bahak maka ulangilah wudhu dan shalat semuanya
3261990 jika salah seorang diantaramu merasakan sesuatu di perutnya lalu dia ragu apakah sudah keluar sesuatu atau belum maka janganlah keluar masjid sehingga ia mendengar suara atau mendapati baunya
3261991 sesungguhnya tidak ada yang menghalangiku menjawab salammu kecuali karena aku tidak ingin menyebut nama allah kecuali dalam keadaan suci

3262000 been issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer
3262001 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3262002 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3262003 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3262004 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3262005 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007

3262040 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3262041 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3262042 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3262043 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3262044 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3262045 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3262046 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3262047 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3262055 adept s a disconnect prestige many women between genital changes and mental changes
3262056 the notion that know onions is some standard stable of sexual functioning drives me up the creek
3262057 these companies regard that womanliness is matter of organ function approximative living or excretion
3262058 to women who posses valid female sexual dysfunction is corporeal and harsh and to report valid s an revilement is an insult to women s health
3262059 we put together substantial money investments marshal the talents of our choicest scientists and clinicians and spend caducity studying prepatent treatments alone to boast that they engage in not good the requirements owing to regulatory essay

3262062 we are having a bit of difficulty getting copies of the brief to the defendant in relation to prison regulations on fire safety
3262063 i feel were playing better and better every time were on the court
3262064 now we have 11 days to play hopefully six matches that creates a mental challenge so were lifting on our game days and staying focused by trying to study our opponents
3262065 at the end of the day we dont go home and write it down
3262066 we just say ok another day you have to look at each match and each set the winning streak will come if you do that its built slowly like the great wall
3262067 der er selvf lgelig fokus p sydbank f r regnskabet markedsstemningen er en smule til nedsiden og futures ligger lavere i europa s derfor vil jeg g tte p en negativ bning men det bliver ikke noget dramatisk
3262068 i hope the community shield wont be the last trophy we win this season
3262069 weve worked hard in pre season and ive seen the hunger in the players eyes
3262070 we are ready to win more trophies because there exists a winning mentality at united
3262071 paul scholes gary neville and ryan giggs have been at the club for so many years but they are still so driven to win trophies
3262072 we saw in the community shield that they are ready to fight for every ball this pushes other players on
3262073 they set the example that the rest of us need to follow they are important players for us
3262074 we have a big squad everyone stayed over the summer and maybe the boss will look to bring in one more player
3262075 we have missed wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo during pre season but against portsmouth we saw that other players can fill their positions
3262076 chelsea are always the main rivals they have a great team with big players its easy for them to buy players
3262077 in your address bar and press enter find a key named
3262078 for competitions like beach volleyball and basketball spectators have one ticket for the whole afternoon morning evening
3262079 they may choose to go to one of them but not all them
3262080 if they find that there are not enough people or if they find that there are too many empty seats they organise some cheerleaders
3262081 this has changed the lay of the land in what we think is fast
3262082 beating the world record by almost four seconds and not getting gold is quite amazing
3262083 i think it makes you more confident the way youre feeling in the water
3262084 i think its just mainly you know people want to win medals
3262085 after trials i was ready to go back to work on the 100 for the next few years and get ready for next time it came a little sooner than i expected
3262086 it was a product of the heat i was in
3262087 for all i knew the guy next to me was going to be going as fast im glad im the one who did it
3262088 i did a five album deal and i dont think it would be right to be making streets albums after that
3262089 i always envisaged them as a box set and ive got a vision for each of the albums the next one will bring it back to the start in a way it will be a lot more futuristic in terms of production but a lot more train of thought
3262090 maybe when im 40 and broke i might come back but that all feels a bit pants

3262093 foi o pr prio pai que ligou mulher a dizer que o menino tinha sido atingido
3262094 quando cheg mos ao s tio onde foi baleado eles j estavam a ser enfiados no carro da pol cia
3262095 os militares da gnr s o homens treinados para saber onde d o e onde querem dar e espetaram dois tiros a uma crian a j tinham vazado o pneu n o precisavam de fazer mais dois tiros isto foi racismo
3262096 isto n o pode ser assim se para prender n o para matar n s n o somos animais
3262097 foram surpreendidos em flagrante delito a furtar bens dentro do estaleiro e apesar da ordem de paragem puseram se em fuga numa carrinha
3262098 a carrinha iniciou a marcha em alta velocidade direito a um militar da gnr obrigando este a atirar se para cima da viatura de servi o para evitar ser colhido e salvar a sua vida
3262099 persegui o em alta velocidade carrinha em fuga que punha em perigo outros utentes da via em circunst ncias que est o a ser apuradas
3262100 os militares da gnr procederam deten o de dois adultos de cerca de 30 anos e nessa ocasi o foi poss vel perceber que um disparo tinha entrado dentro da viatura e atingido um outro ocupante que era uma crian a que viria a falecer
3262101 a crian a foi rapidamente assistida pelos bombeiros volunt rios do zambujal e transportada para o hospital de santa maria
3262102 as circunst ncias est o a ser avaliadas e averiguadas pela gnr e pela pol cia judici ria
3262103 a gnr agiu de pronto e conseguiu localizar em flagrante delito os suspeitos
3262104 lament vel este desfecho que culminou na morte de uma crian a
3262105 nem registos recentes que d em credibilidade a esta teoria

3262107 est o detidos sob acusa o de furto e por terem desobedecido ordem de paragem da gnr
3262108 a desobedi ncia ordem de paragem n o ter posto em risco a vida do militar
3262109 quando se manda parar uma viatura e esta n o p ra mesmo nessa circunst ncia n o se justifica fazer cinco disparos carrinha ainda para mais quando viajava uma crian a janela
3262110 uma situa o claramente deficit ria em termos de informa o relativamente ao procedimento da guarda e ao uso das armas de fogo isso tem de ser muito bem apurado
3262111 uma situa o ainda muito fresca n o se pode concluir nada
3262112 f cil determinar qual foi o proj ctil que vitimou a crian a e qual foi a arma que o disparou e saber quem foi o respons vel
3262113 na perspectiva dos detidos trata se da recolha de ferros usados em obra
3262114 n o estavam fechados os ferros mas n o consegui verificar se estava vedado o acesso parece me que estavam ao ar livre

3262125 overall the numbers came in better than expected the net profit came in around 12 per cent higher than our consensus sales were a little weaker down 1 percent when a rise of 1 per cent had been expected
3262126 but the margin improvement was fantastic and they reiterated their guidance on the operating margin this was a strong performance in terms of cost control

3262180 we have a lot of air lanes we have a lot of traffic we have a lot more people in the metro great lakes area than there would be out west so its prudent to take a measured approach to this but at the end of the day flying late at night over the great lakes a system like this would be of tremendous benefit working with small boat traffic augmenting the u s coast guard

3262256 we expect growth in industrial production to accelerate to 10 per cent in 2008 09 compared to the 8 3 per cent growth recorded in 2007 08
3262257 the recent trends reflected in the index of industrial production iip have raised anxieties of a slowdown in industrial activity
3262258 we believe that industrial growth has slowed because of capacity constraints and inflation is high because demand is high
3262259 the industry is creating fresh capacities at an aggressive pace and as these new capacities get commissioned supplies would increase to meet the soaring demand as a result we believe that the current slowdown seen in the iip numbers is a short term phenomenon that would be reversed by the middle of 2008 09

3262276 do bugger all according to specialist sports doctor catherine spencer smith
3262277 we need to get them active so their generation doesnt die before us
3262278 building up as much bone mineral density as possible is vital
3262279 hopping running skipping jumping off things and rapid twisting are all important
3262280 if a child is old enough and sensible enough to follow instructions say from the age of 11 a programme of light weights and high repetitions is a good idea
3262281 it is safe provided they are supervised the technique is good and crucially that they are not lifting weights that are too heavy a good rule to follow is that if they cannot easily do 10 repetitions the weights are too heavy
3262282 im lucky ive never had any real injuries perhaps because my limbs are in alignment during activities thanks to proper instruction from an early age
3262283 it is also good to do some posture work such as pilates yoga alexander technique or balancing exercises on a fitball or swiss ball
3262284 anything involving balance is good and it doesnt have to be a formal organised activity dance is great at this age you may well be a desk slave so it is particularly important to develop good postural habits it is also a good idea to become accustomed to doing some kind of regular exercise for example cycling or jogging to destress
3262285 if you are overweight or sedentary you may well experience fertility issues exercise can help with hormone regulation and increase the possibility of conception
3262286 thereafter a whole series of things is going on its like having a car when there are a few miles on the clock things start to break down our resting heart rate increases and our muscle mass and strength decrease
3262287 increasing our youthfulness and vitality and improving our skin tone so it is important to do short intense bursts of activity at this age rather than thinking that fitness is all about building endurance whatever cardiovascular activity you do be it indoor rowing running swimming or triathlon make sure you also do strength training you can lose loads of weight doing endurance work but weight training develops the whole body
3262288 we can prevent decline in physical function later in life by pinpointing and dealing with problems now
3262289 compound moves such as squats deadlifts and bench presses done with medium to heavy weights are the key
3262290 free weights are better than machines as they improve functional strength and work the core and again proper instruction is important youre looking at four sets of each exercise of about six to 10 repeats so youre targeting your fast twitch muscle fibres muscle fibres used for intense sprint type movements as opposed to slow twitch fibres used for endurance exercise the more muscle mass you have the higher your metabolic rate and the more fat you burn when youre resting if you are new to weight training though start slowly you have to precondition your body
3262291 while we cant turn back the tide we can slow the rate of decrease a classic cause of disability in elderly people is falling because of loss of balance before we reach that stage if we can reduce the slowing down of the nervous system we can reduce the likelihood of falling when were older
3262292 try doing it with your eyes closed all the muscles twitch and at first you might panic then you start to improve
3262293 low impact exercise is best it is all about protecting the knees and hips
3262294 without wishing to sound depressing were not talking about building strength but decreasing the decline
3262295 its not about throwing the towel in its about being realistic
3262296 anything that can promote the idea of standing up balancing stretching and breathing bringing in all that coordination has got to be good
3262297 you can play them with a limited level of mobility get a really good cardiovascular workout and socialise
3262298 the balance and stability that the poles provide help to reduce the risk of falling regardless of the environment so it can mean the difference between going out and exercising and doing nothing at all
3262299 as you get older its more important than ever to get the right gear
3262300 as we age our thermoregulation isnt so good so it may be an idea to wear more layers of sports clothing when you exercise
3262301 and the more supple you are the better if your balance isnt great to start with do static stretching and if you can manage something more dynamic go for gentle yoga or pilates
3262302 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs

3262313 we saw these kids playing quite close to us and then we noticed them bobbing past
3262314 the girl looked up and we shouted to see if she was ok it was obvious that she was not because she kept going under the water and then started shouting for help
3262315 our friend ran off to find someone with a mobile phone because we did not have ours with us and i stripped off and went in to pull the girl out
3262316 i swam out to them and pulled her back to shore and he managed to get himself together and swam back
3262317 i am a reasonably strong swimmer so i had no reservation about going in but what else can you do
3262318 i know there is the coastguard but it would probably have been too late i think potentially there could have been a disaster because had we not spotted them they would have drifted out
3262319 its to him that they owe their lives one of those situations where we were pleased we were there
3262320 i just hope the children concerned are so much more careful in the future

3262370 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3262371 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3262372 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3262373 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3262374 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3262375 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3262376 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3262377 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3262378 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3262379 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3262380 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3262381 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3262382 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3262383 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3262384 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3262385 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3262386 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3262387 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3262388 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3262389 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3262390 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3262391 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3262392 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3262393 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3262394 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3262395 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3262396 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3262397 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3262398 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3262399 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3262400 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3262401 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3262402 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3262403 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3262404 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3262405 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3262406 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3262407 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3262408 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3262409 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3262410 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3262411 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3262412 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3262413 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3262414 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3262415 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3262416 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3262417 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3262418 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3262419 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3262420 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3262421 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3262422 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3262423 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3262424 who are open to doing something on the production side
3262425 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3262426 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3262427 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3262428 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3262429 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3262430 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3262431 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3262432 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3262433 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3262434 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3262435 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3262436 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3262437 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3262438 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3262439 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3262440 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3262441 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3262442 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3262443 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3262444 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3262445 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3262446 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3262447 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3262448 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3262449 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3262450 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3262451 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3262452 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3262527 last year i had a few more better games and this years been more consistent
3262528 i havent played too many big games to warrant too many votes
3262529 i think a couple of games where i played okay weve lost so that automatically wipes the votes off there
3262530 it doesnt bother me one bit whether im favourite or paying 500 1
3262531 im about playing football in a consistent manner and trying to help north melbourne win games and thats my main aim
3262532 i think dean might slip under the radar the same as the north melbourne football club
3262533 we do every year nothings changed and to tell you the truth were pretty happy with that
3262534 we dont have to talk about ourselves to pump ourselves up and things like that
3262535 the international society should immediately get involved and demand that china stop the repression
3262536 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3262537 one is the sophisticated co ordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organisation to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3262538 ten dead bodies and 11 injured have been brought here
3262539 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
3262540 if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction
3262541 he will need to have access to this in order for us to proceed with this matter
3262542 we are having a bit of difficulty getting copies of the brief to the defendant in relation to prison regulations on fire safety
3262543 we do not have to make a choice about stability versus competition in the australian banking sector
3262544 we need to keep australian banking competitive and stop the westpac takeover of st george
3262545 this would position the combined business to withstand challenging funding markets and take advantage of opportunities created by the dislocation in capital markets
3262546 without fully employing its abilities even at the final moment the imperial nation is surrendering before the enemies propaganda
3262547 i never imagined the torpor of the nations leaders and people
3262548 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3262549 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation
3262550 the sacrifice of so many people who died in the war would go unrequited if this purpose remains unfulfilled
3262551 the refugee crisis is an unacceptable cost of the governments mismanagement of the peace process a peace process should lead to the protection of life and property and yet whats happening is the opposite
3262552 the wfp fully understands that the situation remains fluid and we will continue to work closely with all concerned to further assess the total number of affected persons and adjust our response accordingly
3262553 wfp remains concerned over the growing number of persons displaced by the violence
3262554 many of the affected are women and children and we are concerned for their wellbeing and stand ready to support humanitarian needs
3262555 its a real shame for lucky and disappointing for us because he makes such a huge contribution to the side consistently every week
3262556 considering the workload he has and the job hes required to do its a tribute to him that he has been able to put such a long run of appearances together
3262557 i would imagine that decision could be appealed by the government and i would encourage the government to appeal that particular decision

3262568 the international community collectively held their breath waiting for the reaction of russia after the savage brutal criminal attack by georgia on south ossetia
3262569 after having offered a cease fire in hostilities the back stabbing georgians immediately violated the cease fire invading south ossetia and causing massive destruction and death among innocent civilians among peacekeepers and also destroying a hospital
3262570 russian moving towards tbilisi capital of georgia all bog towns are either bombed or taken by russians this is not peace keeping
3262571 bombs bombs bombs and more bombs 24 7 even when eu officials are in georgia russians still bombing our cities

3262573 been issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer
3262574 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3262575 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3262576 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3262577 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3262578 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007
3262579 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct
3262580 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3262581 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3262582 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3262583 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3262584 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare
3262585 in a large employer base it wouldnt be at all unusual to find half a dozen or more people working there who may have a caring role for people with early dementia or a range of situations in the adult area
3262586 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers
3262587 how the nhs is letting my father die by a top hospital consultant
3262588 more than 100 canadian women with high risk pregnancies have been sent to united states hospitals over the past year in what a doctors group attributes to the lack of a national birthing plan
3262589 109 people had a heart attack or suffered heart failure while on the waiting list fifty of those patients died
3262590 inside sylvia de vries lurked an enormous tumour and fluid totalling 18 kilograms but not even that massive weight gain and a diagnosis of ovarian cancer could assure her timely treatment in canada
3262591 more than 400 canadians in the full throes of a heart attack or other cardiac emergency have been sent to the united states because no hospital can provide the lifesaving care they require here
3262592 up to 500 heart patients die each year while they wait for potentially life saving surgery
3262593 will be denied free national health service treatment for breast cancer if she seeks to improve her chances by paying privately for an additional drug
3262594 doctors are calling for nhs treatment to be withheld from patients who are too old or who lead unhealthy lives

3262597 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3262598 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate

3262604 the evidence that we have shows that your excessive consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor in the incident
3262605 when i read the cica letter i just had no words i could not take it in it felt like i was being punished for having the audacity to step up and say i dont think this should have happened to me it was like going back to the 70s saying she was asking for it how else could you read the letter but as saying its my fault i was raped
3262606 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption
3262607 its weird that a 55 year old grandmother likes action games

3262613 now that were kicking off from the 30 the majority of the balls are being returned
3262614 its a huge wrinkle when you have backs coming out of the backfield and making plays in the passing game
3262615 it can cause some matchup problems in the defense and allow us to do some other things offensively with formations and schemes having two backs of the caliber we have is a special thing
3262616 a lot of the new guys will be getting reps

3262624 the lounge concept for both product and staff service has been modelled around the finest quality you would expect to find in a five star hotel or restaurant and the best part is that the concept is being so well delivered by qantas
3262625 business class standards continue to be upgraded by airlines across the world and singapore airlines managed to retain their title amidst this growing level of competition
3262626 hey look our care service is staffed by people just like you and hence your problems are our problems

3262642 por tanto nadie os juzgue en comida o en bebida o en cuanto a d as de fiesta luna nueva o d as de reposo la palabra d as fue a adida por los traductores
3262643 sabemos que la ley es buena si uno la usa leg timamente
3262644 conociendo esto que la ley no fue dada para el justo sino para los transgresores y desobedientes para los imp os y pecadores

3262695 you know ive worked with a lot of entrepreneurs more than 15 000 the last time i counted if youre just like every one of them youre probably worried about making a mistake in your business getting sued and losing not only your business assets but your house your car and your personal stuff as well am i right about that well you can put up a wall between your personal and business assets so that if heaven forbid you are ever sued your business assets will still be at risk thats why you still need insurance but your personal assets will be safe from attack because they are on the other side of the wall one of these wall things is called a corporation would you like to hear more
3262696 they want like all the latest things and the name brands and all that
3262697 they want to look good in school and at the same time there are certain things that you do need that are a requirement and you know going through what were going through with the economy its like you cant afford certain things
3262698 its definitely a lot harder than it has ever been everything is way more expensive
3262699 theres nothing wrong with talking to your children about whats happening in the economy and how its affecting the household budget so that they can actually see and feel exactly whats happening to the family
3262700 theyll feel less likely to want that expensive ipod or some other product like that
3262701 the trick is to communicate really clearly with children about economic limitations and also to reassure children about the future because children get very concerned that things are unpredictable now and money is short and there is a lot of nervousness they also key into the parents own anxiety
3262702 you should have an essential list of items that you need to buy so that when youre out there in the stores youre not actually making those emotional purchases

3262764 ein effektives programm f r schwachstellenmanagement und compliance versetzt unternehmen in die lage die durch interne und externe bedrohungen entstehenden risiken zu reduzieren und liefert compliance nachweise
3262765 angesichts neuer bedrohungen ver nderter vorschriften und einer zunehmenden geografischen verteilung von standorten und it assets ist es heute schwieriger denn je den sicherheits und compliance zustand einer globalen it infrastruktur zu ermitteln und zu optimieren
3262766 eine l sung wie qualysguard die it sicherheitsmanagement und policy compliance als integrierten service bereitstellt hilft diesen herausforderungen zu begegnen da sie den richtigen adressaten zur richtigen zeit und berall pr zise und bedarfsgerechte informationen liefert
3262767 one of the things were able to attach a voters signature to its record on the system and the benefit of that is that the staff can go through signature verification much easier then theyre doing now with the manual process

3262788 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare
3262789 in a large employer base it wouldnt be at all unusual to find half a dozen or more people working there who may have a caring role for people with early dementia or a range of situations in the adult area
3262790 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers
3262791 our injuries and the need for more offense motivated the deal

3262793 you gravitated towards those primarily responsible because they offered you friendship you were easily taken in and manipulated by them
3262794 i accept that there was no significant monetary benefit for you as a result of your assistance to them nevertheless these are serious offences that you have committed
3262795 it is my view that as a result of that combination of circumstances that you are unlikely to offend again

3262803 three fifths of the firms we talk to say they are having trouble recruiting people with skills in science technology engineering and maths
3262804 some schools lack the specialist physics and chemistry teachers to deliver triple science so the government would have to phase in the policy
3262805 but we hope that by 2013 all schools should have enough specialist teachers to operate it
3262806 it made a very big difference it spoiled our strategy and we were caught between attacking and defending
3262807 had we lost today then i think it would have difficult
3262808 it was encouraging to win this test in kps first game in charge he has had a pretty good match although i am not totally convinced its the right way forward
3262809 but now hes captain he has got to be given a decent chance there has been a bit of an end of term feel to south africas cricket and theres a little bit of hollowness about this performance england still have a little way to go
3262810 he came from left field but they had to take a risk and try to be bold to take 20 wickets and win the match i cant fault them for that
3262811 andrew flintoff isnt good enough to bat at number six he doesnt have the technique and his footwork isnt good enough
3262812 his bowling is fantastic and the presence he brings to the side is great but you cant rely on him to score hundreds when flintoffs in the side it poses more questions than answers
3262813 bowlers are fresh and more likely to be able to take 20 wickets and you have to back your batsmen to score runs
3262814 if you are going to play five bowlers then bring back matt prior as the best batsman wicketkeeper to bat at six but if your wicketkeeper is going to bat at seven or eight then james foster is the best wicketkeeper
3262815 if you are putting your keeper in at six you are not getting to have your best wicketkeeper
3262816 you need contrasting players at the top of the order and we dont have that with strauss and cook
3262817 i like vaughan and cook as a combination and now with the burden of captaincy off his shoulders if vaughan can score runs in county cricket theres no reason why he cant come back to open the batting
3262818 simon has to prove he can bowl the amount of overs needed in a test match i am not sure hes done that at worcestershire this season because theyve been careful how they use him i think its still unknown whether he can do a hard test tour
3262819 kp has been fortunate to have them playing in unison something michael vaughan hadnt had for a while
3262820 if those two keep going then england can start moving forward but they have been beaten by a better side
3262821 im sure i will calm down and realise i finished fourth in an olympic final but at the moment its just so painful to look up at that scoreboard and be so close to gold
3262822 it went much better than yesterday i knew i had to go out much faster and one place i needed to improve was my turn and i think i did that
3262823 he warned me that it will not take long but i thought this means at least around 30 minutes
3262824 we talked just 40 seconds it was the shortest meeting we ever had with a movie director
3262825 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
3262826 first of all in terms of the amount of money spent by advertisers it is so small that it doesnt divert from broadcast tv money the other reason is that in terms of the time spent using online tv services it is actually very small
3262827 this is a shaft of very bright light that cuts through any economic gloom
3262828 advertisers should be taking advantage of a medium that offers proven effectiveness increasing value and is growing
3262829 there is an apparent paradox or dilemma around how audiences can be up and ad revenues down but one reason that explains it is because demand for tv advertising is flat
3262830 this means there has been an increase in the supply of ads in the market and that means prices dropping you could say that eyeballs have never been cheaper in the last 20 years
3262831 clients are looking at cutting costs not expanding in this market
3262832 so it is actually not that great news that commercial impacts are up as this means that prices are down

3262834 im asking myself if its worth continuing i dont even have the desire to swim anymore
3262835 it was very hard to rebound after what happened yesterday
3262836 i think shell start the 200 back im going to push her by tapping on her champions mind set
3262837 im asking myself if its worth continuing i dont even have the desire to swim anymore
3262838 it was very hard to rebound after what happened yesterday
3262839 i think shell start the 200 back im going to push her by tapping on her champions mind set
3262840 i was watching and off the start he had a body length lead at 20 meters
3262841 every time i watch him im more and more in awe
3262842 i knew going into the last 50 i wanted at least a half a body lead on him
3262843 after working hard for so many years ive neglected my family
3262844 now that the competition is over for me i hope to spend more time with my mum
3262845 if this is my last then i consider myself lucky because how many people can take part in four olympics
3262846 although i only got bronze that is proof that im good at my sport
3262847 and if my country still needs me ill continue to shoot
3262848 that skip caray would not want to be canonized so stay tuned and dont turn off your sets
3262849 we had a lot of them trying to sound like vin scully like al michaels
3262850 we never received a single one trying to sound like skip
3262851 but im also reminded of caustic acerbic offensive and ticked off
3262852 skip coined the phrase ryans running the right routes we just cant get the ball to him
3262853 hed say a fan from visalia just caught that one
3262854 people would actually call up and ask how did skip know
3262855 hed like to ask me on the air glenn whats coming up after the game wed have a one sided conversation with him repeating to the audience what i was saying
3262856 tonight we have a movie skip called encino man he said encino man he goes all right fans tonight is an espn sportscenter night i dont think the executives at tbs were too excited about that but the fans they loved him
3262857 and in these last years working with chip you could just see them looking at each other with that pride
3262858 they had a special bond that enriched both of their lives and watching them enriched mine
3262859 he said to me when im done youre going to have to step up in front of all those people and explain what happened
3262860 was a bucket of birdseed he was filling his bird feeders
3262861 that in his last moments as he went from this place to the next place skip was thinking of his lovely birds
3262862 we have a great basketball history but that history also brings a lot of pressure
3262863 because every time a young player shows up everybody compares him to drazen to toni to dino radja in those first years of our country some talents disappeared a little bit under that pressure you know
3262864 but as times gone by i think we have a great generation everybody here is young except captain nikola prkacin and sandro nicevic
3262865 we have six or seven more years to play together for sure im sure croatias going be back in a few years
3262866 they were idols when i was growing up there was a war so i got to know them later i played against toni when he was playing for milwaukee that was a great experience
3262867 after the game we sat and talked had dinner that was awesome for me
3262868 we didnt expect it but after failing to qualify for athens we knew we had no pressure
3262869 hence the situation that he has been detained does not exist
3262870 seven to eight plainclothes officers who beat me and dragged me and my brother hua huilin into two separate cars
3262871 they asked me why i was going to kuanjie protestant church to worship and threatened me saying you are not allowed to go because president bush is going there today
3262872 after about four or five hours when i saw that the people who were watching me had all fallen asleep i fled but im afraid to go home
3262873 i havent heard from him weve been waiting here were so worried
3262874 my father asks me every day where he is and i tell him i dont know

3262876 it is a big game for us tomorrow we have to win at least 2 0 and thats the goal we are going for the victory
3262877 its a big game for us because we must win
3262878 we must win and score a lot of goals but most importantly play better than in the previous games its a final for us we are ready
3262879 he is fit and very motivated so we want to go with him
3262880 we got up early came back late we all just battled and got it done
3262881 we didnt pitch well enough from the beginning plain and simple
3262882 the majority of us in here arent 34 years old
3262883 it is a big game for us tomorrow we have to win at least 2 0 and thats the goal we are going for the victory
3262884 its a big game for us because we must win
3262885 we must win and score a lot of goals but most importantly play better than in the previous games its a final for us we are ready
3262886 he is fit and very motivated so we want to go with him
3262887 i kind of had it in my mind that shed be out there but i didnt really let it affect me
3262888 it felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3262889 i just kind of had fun with it and that helped a lot
3262890 clearly the selection procedures were flawed and only a fool would leave them as they are to await the next disaster

3262893 were going to go in there and scope and clean it up just to make sure hes going to be ready to play opening day
3262894 we need to make sure we know exactly whats going on in there
3262895 i kind of had it in my mind that shed be out there but i didnt really let it affect me

3262903 any modification of the original standard design of a motorcycle or scooter shall first be subject to the approval of lto and the dti
3262904 it is ridiculous why will they prevent us from beautifying our motorcycles it is our own property so we have the right on what to do with it
3262905 if it is unlawful to modify motorcycles then why do they allow modification of public utility jeepneys and other motor vehicles it is unfair
3262906 spare guimaras have appeared in this province marking the start of a campaign against mining activities on the island
3262907 this will destroy the island nava told reporters here yesterday at the sidelines of the briefing on rehabilitation efforts on areas affected by the august 2006 oil spill
3262908 we can recover from an oil spill but damage from mining operations would be permanent he said
3262909 but the possibility of their being involved in that business is not remote because our information shows that they need money to support their vice which is drugs
3262910 during the hearing mayor margarico and mr minurtio had expressed the concern that additional quarrying operations along suage river would threaten the janiuay bridge and said they were not given updates on actions made by the provincial environment and natural resources office penro
3262911 her office had informed gov niel tupas cong arthur defensor the ombudsman and the president on developments on the matter
3262912 mrs sucaldito had also pointed out that a report of the mines and geosciences bureau had stressed that the quarry operations downstream of suage river had nothing to do with the destruction of the bridge

3262943 pushed his followers to a radical discipleship that affirmed simple lifestyle polemicized against the modern easy way of people getting converted without repentance without renouncing the world and insisted that such renunciation of the world include such social sins as slavery driving hard bargains and oppressing the hireling in his wages

3262945 let us think about it and get back to you
3262946 there are people in our church who believe that christians should not wear a lot of jewelry if we were to allow you to get your ears pierced it would cause a problem with those people we dont believe that it is a matter of salvation but for the sake of our position of leadership we dont feel like we can give you permission to do that

3262951 he has braced himself for his first sentence of imprisonment
3262952 he thinks because he doesnt drink every day he is not an alcoholic
3262953 but you deny you even have a problem you are a danger to yourself and others on the road
3262954 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening the georgian capital tblisi
3262955 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3262956 would be inconsistent with assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited
3262957 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3262958 an immediate cease fire withdrawal of forces from the conflict zone a return to the military status quo as of aug 6 and a commitment to refrain from the use of force
3262959 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3262960 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region

3262978 das verh ltnis der linken zu rechtsstaat und verfassungsschutz muss gekl rt werden
3262979 es kann nicht sein dass die linke sagt sie w hlt j rgen walter nicht
3262980 ich rate ottmar schreiner seine ambitionen als arbeitsminister in einer anders zusammengesetzten koalition zu verwirklichen
3262981 wir sollten ohne schaum vor dem mund auch ber die erweiterung der maut auf kleine lkws und pkws diskutieren
3262982 angesichts des milliardenschweren investitionsstaus und des t glichen verkehrsinfarkts kommen wir um eine mauterh hung nicht herum
3262983 what is your opinion simon from whom do the kings of the earth take tolls or census tax from their subjects or from foreigners
3262984 then the subjects are exempt but that we may not offend them go to the sea drop in a hook and take the first fish that comes up open its mouth and you will find a coin worth twice the temple tax give that to them for me and for you
3262985 nothing other than any normal sadness that comes with the husband being deployed next month
3262986 this has changed the lay of the land in what we think is fast
3262987 beating the world record by almost four seconds and not getting gold is quite amazing
3262988 i think it makes you more confident the way youre feeling in the water
3262989 i think its just mainly you know people want to win medals
3262990 after trials i was ready to go back to work on the 100 for the next few years and get ready for next time it came a little sooner than i expected
3262991 it was a product of the heat i was in
3262992 for all i knew the guy next to me was going to be going as fast im glad im the one who did it
3262993 gasp of awe thats the lady that kourtney spoke so highly of and said she was excited for me to glean from
3262994 this is another exciting development for tesco it complements our entries into china and the united states giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world
3262995 our agreement will enable us to share our international retail expertise supporting trent in the development of their star bazaar hypermarket business and benefiting indian consumers

3262999 es ist insofern interessant als dass es den aufsichtsr ten ihre pflichten in erinnerung ruft sowie den umstand dass auch sie dem allgemeinen deutschen schadenshaftungsrecht unterliegen
3263000 nachl ssigkeit und schlamperei reichen nicht um sie zu verurteilen
3263001 der gesetzentwurf f r das bilmog nennt als aufgabe des pr fungsausschusses explizit die berwachung der wirksamkeit des risikomanagements des internen kontrollsystems und der internen revision
3263002 in zukunft werden sich aufsichtsr te daher viel mehr mit der frage konfrontiert sehen ob sie diesen verpflichtungen auch nachgekommen sind
3263003 diese innenhaftung macht sinn sie sorgt daf r dass alle aktion re gleich behandelt werden und nicht einzelne aktion re die als erstes ein urteil erwirkt haben bevorzugt werden
3263004 genaue zahlen sind nicht bekannt da die dunkelziffer ungeheuer gro ist interessant ist dass die angriffe mittlerweile aus nahezu allen l ndern in nahezu alle l nder gehen
3263005 mit qualysguard k nnen unternehmen schwachstellen im gesamten netzwerk ermitteln
3263006 wir haben bereits mehrere regierungen und staatliche organe bei der sicherung ihrer systeme beraten und unterst tzt
3263007 eine grundlegende aufgabe der it sicherheitsmanager ist der schutz ihres unternehmens vor internen und externen bedrohungen auditoren erwarten policies die beschreiben wie ein unternehmen f r sicherheit und integrit t sorgt belege daf r dass die policies operationalisiert wurden und nachweise dass das unternehmen konformit tsl cken finden und schlie en kann
3263008 ein effektives programm f r schwachstellenmanagement und compliance versetzt unternehmen in die lage die durch interne und externe bedrohungen entstehenden risiken zu reduzieren und liefert compliance nachweise
3263009 angesichts neuer bedrohungen ver nderter vorschriften und einer zunehmenden geografischen verteilung von standorten und it assets ist es heute schwieriger denn je den sicherheits und compliance zustand einer globalen it infrastruktur zu ermitteln und zu optimieren
3263010 eine l sung wie qualysguard die it sicherheitsmanagement und policy compliance als integrierten service bereitstellt hilft diesen herausforderungen zu begegnen da sie den richtigen adressaten zur richtigen zeit und berall pr zise und bedarfsgerechte informationen liefert

3263017 mit der stiftung deutsche sporthilfe haben wir den idealen partner gefunden um uns noch st rker als partner des sports einbringen zu k nnen
3263018 wir wollen solidarit t demonstrieren und die strahlkraft des fu balls in den dienst der anderen sportarten stellen unser fokus liegt dabei auf der elitef rderung der sporthilfe
3263019 der profi fu ball in deutschland ist wirtschaftlich sehr gut aufgestellt daraus erw chst auch eine verantwortung der wir uns stellen aus respekt vor den leistungen anderer sportarten
3263020 der sport erf llt in deutschland vielf ltige aufgaben das reicht von der sportlichen fitness jedes einzelnen bis hin zum olympischen spitzensport dabei werden auch werte wie leistung fairplay und miteinander vermittelt
3263021 die dfl wird durch die partnerschaft mit der sporthilfe ihrer unternehmerischen und sozialen verantwortung gerecht gemeinsam wollen wir den sport in deutschland durch vielf ltige aktionen weiter voranbringen
3263022 mit der dfl engagiert sich die herausragende professionelle institution im deutschen sport zuk nftig f r die vielfalt des sports denn sie unterst tzt so ber 4 000 sporthilfe athleten in ber 50 sportarten dar ber hinaus ffnet sie mit hilfe ihrer kommunikativen m glichkeiten der sporthilfe neue zielgruppen die wir sonst mit unserer botschaft und unserem auftrag nicht erreichen k nnten
3263023 the international community collectively held their breath waiting for the reaction of russia after the savage brutal criminal attack by georgia on south ossetia
3263024 after having offered a cease fire in hostilities the back stabbing georgians immediately violated the cease fire invading south ossetia and causing massive destruction and death among innocent civilians among peacekeepers and also destroying a hospital
3263025 russian moving towards tbilisi capital of georgia all bog towns are either bombed or taken by russians this is not peace keeping
3263026 bombs bombs bombs and more bombs 24 7 even when eu officials are in georgia russians still bombing our cities
3263027 my tendents are not damaged in a way that i need surgery
3263028 ten dead bodies and 11 injured have been brought here said khan abbas a police official sent to the citys main lady reading hospital
3263029 been issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer
3263030 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3263031 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3263032 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3263033 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3263034 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007
3263035 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3263036 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3263037 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3263038 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3263039 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3263040 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3263041 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare
3263042 in a large employer base it wouldnt be at all unusual to find half a dozen or more people working there who may have a caring role for people with early dementia or a range of situations in the adult area
3263043 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers

3263045 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct
3263046 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3263047 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3263048 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3263049 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself

3263080 such fervour from davos blog about olympicofiles such as myself seems somewhat misplaced i have to say that people who do art things are all too often untalented and pretentious and at least people who get in a pool and just swim really fast dont usually crap on too much about it and really often dont seem too pleased with themselves either compare their attitude with that of most people in indie rock bands for instance who are generally convinced they are genii of course real or good art is another matter but then it seems a bit thin on the ground having said that i did see a very good play last week called spook based on a true story of a bendigo chap enlisted to spy for asio as opposed to a torturous rendition of a play called top girls which received very good reviews and we went to see in new york set at the top girls employment agency in london in the early 1980s this groundbreaking theatrical play tells the story of marlene an ambitious career woman who has just been appointed head of the firm but as she celebrates her achievements can we applaud her values this bold and ingenious work from the singularly talented author of far away and cloud nine offers one of the theatres most honest portraits of what it means to be a woman in the modern world directed by james macdonald who staged the new york premiere of ms churchills a number the cast will feature mary catherine garrison jennifer ikeda elizabeth marvel martha plimpton and marisa tomei

3263114 georgien hat bereits die an dieses land gestellten forderungen ber die einstellung der kampfhandlungen angenommen genauso muss auch die russische regierung handeln
3263115 ich bin ber die berichte zutiefst besorgt laut denen die russischen truppen die grenzen des konfliktgebiets berschritten die georgische stadt gori angegriffen haben und die georgische hauptstadt tiflis bedrohen
3263116 wenn diese berichte stimmen bedeuten diese handlungen russlands eine bedeutende und flagrante eskalation des konflikts in georgien
3263117 diese schritte w rden nicht den zusicherungen russlands entsprechen laut denen seine ziele auf eine wiederherstellung des status quo gerichtet sind der vor dem beginn der kampfhandlungen am 6 august bestanden hat

3263134 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3263135 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3263136 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3263137 but in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour
3263138 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare

3263196 i think of all the teams we could have had that is the toughest or one of the toughest obviously we looked at arsenal liverpool juventus schalke and we got one of the most difficult in one respect its a tough draw for us on the other its now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us this is a reward for a great achievement last season in reaching this stage to get one of the big teams it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often im sure the fans will be delighted
3263197 arsenal always wants to play champions league and i think arsenal needs to play champions league if you have players like this good players big stadium then i think you need to play in the highest league in europe but this is football if you dont win two games then you dont qualify and we play uefa cup
3263198 i know them quite well as i have dutch satellite it was quite though a big shock because in holland everyone expected ajax to win and in the end twente played better and these things happen in football
3263199 they had a great year last year but they lost two of their best playmakers karim el ahmadi and orlando engelaar however they got theo janssen from vitesse so they are still in good shape with a good team

3263214 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3263215 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3263216 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3263217 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3263218 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3263219 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3263220 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3263221 ill probably never write a book because there are already too many books on every subject i can think of
3263222 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3263271 in the second race which the guys won they did not actually sail that much different to what they had in the first
3263272 the key is to keep doing things right and the breaks will come in race two they got the break they rounded mark one in second place and the argentinians ahead got their spinnaker caught
3263273 phil trimmed the kite to perfection and they sailed over the top of argentina once ger and phil had the lead they never looked back in fact it was possibly the biggest race winning margin of the games so far 46 seconds ahead of second place
3263274 we need to have a strong verification regime in order to remove north korea from the list

3263277 but we arent at the point where we are satisfied with what they have put on the table thus far
3263278 if the administration lifted sanctions anyway without verification it would have just shot our credibility in the whole region

3263285 i have been preparing for olympics since the past three years undergoing strenuous training and several tests none of the tests were found positive except for the june 6 sample collected in pune
3263286 it sai must have definitely manipulated my sample otherwise how could other samples taken just about a fortnight later be negative if it is not the great indian dope trick then what is it
3263287 moreover if i am tested positive why was i still kept in olympic camp for more than two months

3263299 while we are here in qingdao it is fantastic that we are able to visually communicate with the team on the ground back home from the heart of the olympic competition
3263300 although there is a team of sailors and support staff out here in china there is a significant team of people still in england who have played a key part in the build up to the games and will continue to do so throughout them we want everyone at rya hq to be part of our olympic experience and this vidyo technology enables us to share our unique insights and experiences and keep the whole team together even though we are thousands of miles apart
3263301 having worked with the rya for some time it became clear to us that what was needed was a rapid implementation of a high quality solution that allowed scalability and clear natural communications
3263302 taking into account the chinese firewall restrictions vidyo was our natural choice
3263303 the success of any team effort whether competing in the workplace or in the olympics greatly depends on easy access to clear and natural communications
3263304 the quality and simplicity of vidyoconferencing offers that competitive edge vidyo enables the rya to work seamlessly on their laptops and pcs across general purpose internet networks like adsl hotel wireless hotspots and 3g wireless networks what they see and hear must be precise and accurate and vidyo is able to deliver that high level of video and audio clarity were happy that we can play a small part in helping this capable team capture medals in qingdao

3263339 companies can get lost trying to implement overly complex it governance strategies and unfortunately in the process end up creating large bureaucracies and complex metrics that contribute little value to the organization
3263340 were finding that many companies have made rapid progress in their it governance initiatives by starting with a ppm implementation focused on a simple and pragmatic approach these companies have been able to make measurable impact on the business while implementing reasonable controls adding layers of further sophistication only when and where they were really needed
3263341 when we implemented our it governance process we were actively working on 20 projects and we identified 60 additional projects that our three business units wanted us to accomplish so we needed to establish an effective prioritization process
3263342 with the innotas on demand ppm solution as a core of our it governance process we have complete visibility into all of our active and potential projects and we can easily prioritize them and focus on the projects that add the most value to the business

3263437 but i guess you could say im feeling pretty comfortable on them oval tracks anymore
3263438 since weve been teammates ive really seen his confidence grow on ovals and he knows what he wants in the car and it shows
3263439 it started to happen right after indy scott dedicated himself to making himself a better driver on ovals
3263440 hes done a terrific job and hes raised the bar for himself and our team
3263441 i did ok on ovals when i first started but it wasnt something i enjoyed all that much
3263442 its pretty straightforward on the mile and a half tracks its
3263443 theres a fine line between confidence and intimidation on ovals and i think scott is right in the middle its fun to run with him and hes a very bright guy and im real glad hes decided he likes ovals
3263444 scott is having a season like i did in 2005
3263445 were running real well and leading the standings but there are a lot

3263448 were competitive yes but on the other hand we want to use our competitive desire to build the series we welcome competition we want competition its what drives us
3263449 it was a very positive meeting and we were happy with the quality and quantity
3263450 we were very well represented with a dozen engine manufacturers and race shop engine builders in the room it was a very positive meeting from all aspects it probably exceeded our expectations
3263451 also you cant underestimate the second positive which is simply its sound its the natural muffler with more road and street courses city streets and venues of those types on the schedule its nice to turn our adjustables down a little bit and its got a great sound to it
3263452 i think youll be seeing turbos in production cars very soon
3263453 i honestly think the participation level was higher than anyone could have imagined or i would have anticipated
3263454 what was most encouraging is that throughout the discussions there was clearly more agreement than there was disagreement and a lot of energy for a follow up meeting and a lot of common ground
3263455 we said were willing to rewrite the rules if anybody thinks weve got an unfair advantage we told them to write the rules and tell us what we need to do well play with one hand tied behind our back if thats what people want
3263456 the encouraging thing is that all of them wanted to come back

3263464 we are trying to solicit facts and opinions from the different sectors or groups in our society so that the city government could come up with a solid basis for our stand
3263465 really the city hall is all ears for your voices
3263466 the light warms me so friend too long have i sat away from it
3263467 all the fuss over them and now they are gone and we return back to the beginning is he rebuilding
3263468 that is less and less your concern fallen one there is still a matter of your transgressions
3263469 i was made as he made me to be there was nothing else i could do i was created to serve him and only him did he expect me to serve any other he needed an other half and that is what he made me to be
3263470 he let you out of your realm he only wishes your submission to his will
3263471 i was not made that way and you know that it true do you still sit in heaven metatron
3263472 so then you remember what you needed to do to gain that privilege you needed to submit to god you were beaten just to prove that you were not his equal
3263473 do you hold a grudge against god for his actions
3263474 that is a truth we could argue until all of creation unravels the truth i propose is that you were made to bear that punishment so you can feel no anguish over its performance you hating god for his beating would be like a human hating his lungs for breathing he does not do what he must we just do as he made us
3263475 your argument has become convoluted i wont listen to it any longer
3263476 then speak his words is it to be a lake of fire then that is what was always said
3263477 i would not so easily cast away something i have made you still have value even if you cannot see it
3263478 metatron spoke truly as did you i can only do as i must each of my creations can only do as i allow them to you my flawed creation might be the answer you were made to be free you were made to be defiant i ask you simply remake the world use my power i have failed and i wish to see if you will succeed
3263479 this is a game this is just as we did to job you are only doing this to prove me wrong this to humiliate me further i will not have it
3263480 i ought to have known you were made to defy me you would not do this for me even if i begged
3263481 that is right i know your games and i will not play them again let the world rot it is what you deserve
3263482 i would have you by my side again no longer my adversary
3263483 must i make life couldnt we leave the world as it is it is perfect now we dont need to add more
3263484 you may do as you will lucifer you are the creator now
3263485 i shall not grow lonely i will always have you
3263486 but what if i take my light away from you
3263487 i cannot make something that will not turn its back on me they will do to me as i have done to you

3263586 but there was something else as well a letter addressed to a certain miss elisabeth allaway from a one mr roald carrick do you happen to know who would be writing letters to you
3263587 well since the cat seems to have your tongue ill inquire again who is this roald
3263588 well ill leave you to that but i shall only ever let you read my letter if you let me read that one
3263589 wait wait im almost there youre so jumpy and impatient today
3263590 i think there is a story here that i havent fully heard yet
3263591 a letter from aine and one from her parents you can read them later
3263592 my statement still stands elisabeth mind telling me what happened between you and this roald fellow
3263593 well golly levi cant we leave this for another day
3263594 roald was a good friend of mine at college i met him at church we became good friends quite fast and admittedly i fell for him fairly quickly but i did not admit that until after some not so great things had come to pass
3263595 such as both of us being really stupid and doing some things we shouldnt have
3263596 i guess its not that bad if you take a step back but if you look at it in the context of the relationship we had then it wasnt wise we both allowed ourself to drift into a friendship that was very close bordering on romantic we spent a great deal of time together alone time together
3263597 end of my first year he asked me to consider marrying him someday it happened to be a very hard emotional week for me and at that time i was convinced i only thought of him as a friend i knew otherwise later and lived to regret what i did
3263598 i know now that i did like him if not love but im not even sure what love is now
3263599 so and now hes come back into your life and youve got no idea what to do on top of that hes apologized and asked to talk to you
3263600 i know i had convinced myself that we were both silly and immature and that there was nothing really ever there and that i just needed to forget about it all and now i need some time to think and pray i think im so confused its like he dropped off of the face of the earth at least my world and then bang hes back in it
3263601 and you get back to that letter levi cause i want to hear about it as soon as can be
3263602 a matter of time before they ask barack obama and mccain well mccains talked about his past barack obama if hes ever had an affair

3263608 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3263609 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3263610 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3263611 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3263612 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3263613 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3263614 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3263615 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3263616 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3263617 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3263618 there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3263619 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3263620 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp

3263662 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3263663 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3263664 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3263665 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3263666 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3263667 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3263668 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3263669 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3263670 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3263671 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3263672 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3263673 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3263674 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3263675 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3263676 you were from a perfect world a world that threw me away today today to run away
3263677 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3263679 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3263680 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3263681 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3263682 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3263683 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3263684 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3263685 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3263686 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3263687 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3263688 advertisers and their agencies rightly demand transparency and accountability from newspapers pressclick is an important initiative to ensure that we give them as much information as we can about the online audience for national newspapers
3263689 pressclick will provide media planners and buyers with new data analysis and insights to add to their knowledge of the online newspaper audience

3263692 bauer always wanted something in the west midlands it has the right recipe for managing city size stations
3263693 bauer media is a business with more than 80 brands across multiple platforms we have discussions around our business on an ongoing basis but we dont comment on any individual discussions
3263694 clearly it makes sense for gmg to be looking at buying heart 106 and rebranding it to century which is what it used to be the transformation would be relatively easy
3263695 the pressure will be on high profile individuals boston consulting will have looked at the revenue per head in each department but the issue for itv sales is they still need a support business perhaps bcg is taking an over simplistic approach
3263696 numerous english church councils attempted to restore the connection between baptism and confirmation but in reality few people were presented for confirmation this led archbishop peckham to rule in 1281 that baptized persons who had not been confirmed could not receive communion this was the rubric in the pre reformation sarum rite in use at salisbury cathedral considered the most significant influence on the first book of common prayer 1549 this ruling was in effect in the american prayer books until the 1979 edition the requirement was eliminated because it was regarded as a barrier to fellowship with christians of other denominations this accommodation is now recognized as having a negative effect on the doctrinal and catechetical integrity of the church
3263697 a negative effect on the doctrinal and catechetical integrity of the church
3263698 now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost
3263699 and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto johns baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied
3263700 having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness
3263701 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ
3263702 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law
3263703 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will
3263704 orders come from the same word but it is correct to day that confirmation is
3263705 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many
3263706 and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord
3263707 and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life
3263708 editorial robert downey jr deserves an oscar for tropic thunder
3263709 early this morning monday when it came to my attention i was really surprised that she had not been paroled in with the little girl
3263710 we have reports that six people were killed it was near badaber
3263711 about 18 paf pakistan air force employees were traveling to the base when the bomb planted on the bridge went off
3263712 two days ago i was pessimistic yesterday i was extremely carefully optimistic and today i am just carefully optimistic
3263713 its been a whirlwind experience and the past eight years ive learned a lot about this and i guess the gold medal is the reason i did a lot of this
3263714 ive gone from a naive 14 year old to an under pressure 18 year old in athens and now a relieved 22 year old
3263715 this gold medal was for the believers those who stuck by me
3263716 i sure copped a lot of it after athens i think a lot was a misunderstanding but it was really difficult but it made me a much stronger person and it has made this all the more sweeter
3263717 to come out as an olympic gold medalist is way more important than winning at my first olympics its been a good story
3263718 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3263719 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3263724 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3263725 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3263726 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3263727 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3263728 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3263729 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3263730 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3263731 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3263732 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3263733 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3263734 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3263735 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3263736 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3263737 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3263738 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3263739 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3263740 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3263741 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3263742 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3263743 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3263744 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3263745 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3263746 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3263747 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3263748 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3263749 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3263750 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3263751 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3263752 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3263753 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3263754 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3263755 the index was rangebound as there were mixed signals in themarket u s shares latest rally on a stronger dollar waspositive but the shanghai markets continued falls weighed onsentiment
3263756 the focus during the next several sessions will be whetherthe index can rise above 1 600 but im afraid investor appetitefor dollar denominated assets is stronger than that for asianequities
3263757 the main reason lies in costs stemming from higher wages while sales have come in as expected we can expect somenegative reaction when the market opens
3263758 this is another exciting development for tesco itcomplements our entries into china and the united states givingus access to another of the most important economies in theworld
3263759 our agreement will enable us to share our internationalretail expertise supporting trent in the development of theirstar bazaar hypermarket business and benefiting indianconsumers
3263760 in the second quarter of 2008 we saw strong growth of ourpaediatric vaccines driven by quinvaxem
3263761 the decision has been made after several discussions between rikki and myself
3263762 he felt as though the role was impacting on his own personal performance and that was affecting the team
3263763 it is a brave decision by rikki and he deserves respect for putting the team and the club ahead of his own personal ambitions as a captain
3263764 that is an awful lot to be going on for any player and rikki felt it was best for everyone concerned if he gave up the captaincy
3263765 for the 9 months to 30 june 2008 overall group performanceis well ahead of the corresponding period in the prior year inline with the groups expectations
3263766 this strong performance is despite the significantweakening in the value of sterling against the euro during theperiod
3263767 for the year to 30 sept 2008 the group expects to deliveranother period of double digit profit and earnings growth despite the fall in the value of sterling affecting thetranslation of profits
3263768 the companys services unit fared better than i expectedand it is particularly positive that they repeated the 2009margin targets for the divisions
3263769 the profit warning was just a slip and i think that themarket will react positively again towards the company
3263770 id have to say its not a schedule that suits an olympics
3263771 if you play one match then have to play against a fresh player it doesnt seem logical
3263772 ive played in grand slams and olympics and ive never seen that happen before
3263773 marina still has to win her match so it may not be an issue
3263774 but if she does we will have a talk to them organisers and give our opinion probably nothing will happen
3263775 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3263776 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3263777 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3263778 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3263779 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3263780 according to the private espionage industry itself roughly one in four of your comrades is on a multinationals payroll
3263781 like the state security services which ended up running class war in the 1990s after a hugely successful penetration these spies work to become reliable members of any protest movement
3263782 is that youll never know hes around and hell never get caught
3263783 the fact you cant see them it means nothing at all
3263784 like the state security services which ended up running class war in the 1990s after a hugely successful penetration
3263785 nobody else has got enough guts to run against a sitting judge
3263786 ive had problems with my issues with him since i first started the first year i was here
3263787 ive never had a fight with him or anything ive spoken to him personally about some of the problems but ive never expected things to come up again the other problems to him not being known as somebody who treats individuals with dignity and respect
3263788 courtroom attendance is the most important part of a judges work you have to be there day in and day out and preparation is so important too

3263829 we welcome all fans to ewood park whatever their backgrounds we acknowledge that we live in a diverse society and therefore need to accommodate the needs of people from all walks of life
3263830 this is a fantastic gesture by blackburn rovers and shows that the club has got a very good understanding of the needs of the muslim community
3263831 there is a large muslim community in east lancashire and i am sure that this move will encourage more muslim people to go to matches
3263832 what they have done is very positive and should be commended
3263833 as everyone knows blackburn has two cathedrals one here in the centre of town and another at ewood park
3263834 blackburn rovers have to find ways to appeal to a wider community and already offer many superb facilities
3263835 the club is to be congratulated on its open mindedness and recognising the spirituality of all of its fans it is crucial that inter faith projects like this are allowed to succeed
3263836 there is no pressure we are not expected to win but then again people said we were not expected to win at preston or wolves last season
3263837 it is a great experience for everyone at the club for the fans and also for the younger lads in the squad
3263838 they have seen garry thompson and carl baker move onwards and upwards and we have a few good players who are capable of making the step up
3263839 so wednesday is a good chance for them to experience how things are done in the championship

3263888 our injuries and the need for more offense motivated the deal
3263889 hes going to hit a lot of home runs and that helps any lineup
3263890 the three game series is an opportunity for us to get things right
3263891 and if it gets away from us then well know where we are at the end of those three games it could be sobering and it could be something to hold onto and look forward
3263892 but as of right now we havent done a good job of bringing it back to the table were losing time quick
3263893 arizona is the team were trying to catch and were not doing a very good job of gaining ground so we have to sweep
3263894 one of the most difficult weeks weve had here in a long time
3263895 of course i do thats the reason we go out and play every night i think everybody in this clubhouse feels that way
3263896 i wanted just to be constructive and tell the guy you know im not making 20 million a season the guy takes plays off you guys look at the tape
3263897 it just came out of nowhere and i was like huh
3263898 and he said it again and i was just like what and he said it again
3263899 the batsmen did not put up a good show here and that probably cost us the series it was critical that the middle order got runs and there was not enough consistency from any of the batters and that probably what cost us the game and the test match here
3263900 having won the toss it was important to get a big score we got a good start but could not capitalise for a new batsman to go straightway and face two spinners it is never easy if they had converted the early starts it would have been a different story overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series
3263901 bowlers put their hearts out ishant showed brilliant performance throughout the series zaheer showed lot of character harbhajan was fantastic to come back from all that he had been through during the last couple of months
3263902 i have never seen so many players getting injured in a single day but i guess that is a part and parcel of the game
3263903 i think mendis was the difference picking up 26 wickets when murali and mendis bowl together it is not easy to get runs out of them and we kept losing wickets because of the pressure created by the two they bowled brilliantly throughout the series
3263904 we need to sit down and work it out there are teething problems with any new technology or with any new thing which come in
3263905 im alone wait grandmas watching me i need to find somebody
3263906 wow you seem really alert did you take the xanax
3263907 oh did you know she wants to be a dentist
3263908 celebrate the wonderful boy my brother was and the life he has had
3263909 we will all be there to get through it and will share the memories doujon would like us to share
3263910 be strong everyone and i know your prayers are with us and you are all greatly in our hearts
3263911 my chemical romances gerard way has remixed a song by the cure for a forthcoming ep entitled hypnagogic states
3263912 you get things done on these walks besides getting healthier
3263913 so i want to try to use walking to improve the health of the community at the same time it gets me next to people with everyday issues
3263914 at the council meeting im wearing a suit and ive got my public persona on and every time someone comes up to the podium you dont know if its a good thing or a bad thing and you have your veil up
3263915 it really connects you to what matters to real people
3263916 i bring in chris he writes down notes and soon the problem is solved
3263917 first im consoling an owner then i have to take a bloody bag and open it not knowing what condition the animal is in

3263921 identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in southern california
3263922 i have no country to fight for my country is the earth and i am a citizen of the world
3263923 it shows theres hunger in mendota and people will take anything
3263924 america is uh is no longer uh what it could be what it once was and i say to myself i dont want that future for my children
3263925 you looking at my cleavage huh that that bang boom
3263926 has nothing to do with the preparation of the games
3263927 its very sad whats going on in the world and we share the concern of the ioc but i would refer to the politicians for that
3263928 but personally i do believe that the olympics is something that can make things happen and im sure the olympic values and olympic ideals will be considered
3263929 it is a national problem and the ioc is not supposed to comment on situations like this we just hope that its going to be solved fast and it seems they made progress today we hope for the best
3263930 this is a wonderful opportunity for two organizing committees who have the same common interests to celebrate a little bit the time we have together in beijing
3263931 this is about our friendship our partnership our willingness to work together for the good of the olympic movement
3263932 they in my opinion are not late but they do not have one single day to lose or to waste
3263933 allens second album stuck on the naughty step had been due before the end of 2008 but label bosses are understood to be concerned about perrys current popularity
3263934 thats the challenge for me to be part of the team that wins the european cup again
3263935 we did it last season after nine years and weve never won two years on the trot so the most important thing is to step up to the plate again this season
3263936 weve never let complacency set into this club weve always been of the mentality that every year you wipe the slate clean
3263937 it doesnt matter what happened the season before whether we won two trophies three trophies four trophies or no trophies weve always been able to wipe out what happened thats been one of the great things the manager passed down to us
3263938 it was something i had waited a long time for the manager told me i was playing before the match and i was happy
3263939 its just good to get some minutes under my belt this is the beginning for me i dont feel a great sense of achievement ive got to improve on that
3263940 hopefully with minutes on the pitch and training pitch that will happen
3263941 usually i would have been up and down more and had a bit more sharpness on the ball but maybe i am being over critical for the person with the trained eye i am sure it was noticeable im just happy to be out there and i will improve the most important thing for me is to stay fit
3263942 i wasnt nervous i was excited to get out on the pitch ive really been looking forward to it
3263943 it is a fantastic challenge and ive always looked forward to challenges in my career at this club it is a continual challenge but for me personally after being out so long there are a number of challenges in front of me and i am not nervous about that
3263944 i want to thrive on the fact ive not got a great deal of time left in my career im 34 years of age so im just going to enjoy it for as long as i can
3263945 i think the stories that im not going to get back are inevitable when you dont play for so long and at my age i was okay for the last two months of last season but i just came back too late the players were playing too well
3263946 with gary you can see personality and character of the human being
3263947 when you think gary neville has been out for that length of time and the character he has its remarkable hes a remarkable man you can see it in his eyes the determination and quality of his game are absolutely superb
3263948 wes brown only missed something like two games last season he was absolutely outstanding but it is a dilemma who to play
3263949 looking at it i dont think gary will play all the time hopefully if we get 30 35 games in his first season back we will be absolutely delighted especially knowing that wes brown equally and da silva can do a job here
3263950 i think it is probably the most inventive side in terms of style and the players interchanging in the way they do thats different to the united teams ive played in in the past
3263951 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3263952 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3263953 i think he performed well today though he didnt get a gold medal
3263954 since he has participated in four games a bronze medal is an historical breakthrough for him
3263955 this operation pre dates project wickenby but it is another example of how the afp in concert with its project wickenby partners continues to focus on arrangements involving offshore secrecy havens and money laundering to ensure those involved pay their fair share of tax
3263956 recent modifications have ensured that every video uploaded to youtube retains its original audio levels
3263957 the problem was apparently related to some sort of overly harsh audio compression that reduced the overall volume of audio files as well as the dynamic range of certain recordings by running them through an audio compressor not as in bit rate but as in volume processing

3263971 we hope to see if we can find out what some of the gaps are
3263972 its nice to be able to sit outside hopefully it will be the start of a cooling down trend
3263973 when police released the surveillance video to the media for help in identifying the men in the store there was a man with a distinguished hat
3263974 until you finish your work and the council acts on it all permitting based on that flawed ordinance must be stopped
3263975 even though you may not be empowered to do anything about that law you can make a statement
3263976 we do not want you to lose sight of all the things that can be done and must be done locally
3263977 the recent oil price move to 115 if sustained is a game changing event for the industry
3263978 sustained lower oil prices could cause the industry to avoid the tipping point
3263979 does not appear to have kept up with falling oil prices
3263980 now listen you are young and you dont know many things but do remember this you are alone in this earth
3263981 in the end the satisfaction which all of us seek it seems can come only from our discovering that we really have molded our life into whatever we want it to be
3263982 it would be great if you guys could teach us how to use those databases so we didnt have to ask you every time
3263983 were confident that whatever the kimbells decision is it will be wonderful for the cultural district
3263984 naturally the board is very sensitive of the need to explain and present the new design properly they are keen to wait until right moment to unveil it the board is sensitive to the two fronts the architectural community and the community at large
3263985 a lot of us couldnt understand why there was any objection
3263986 were taking soil samples to let us know foundation conditions as well as the sites geothermal properties so the museum can consider various advanced energy technologies
3263987 weve had several discussions with high officials of the city and advised them to whats going on
3263988 a man doesnt learn to understand anything unless he loves it
3263989 we are looking forward to introducing this promising new therapy option to us patients
3263990 we are delighted to begin this important us trial with alpharadin and to be working with the mskcc one of the worlds leading cancer centers the start of this us clinical trial is an important step in our overall clinical development of alpharadin and we hope it will lead the way towards more widespread evaluation of alpharadin in us cancer centers after further discussions with fda later this year
3263991 it seems that the weakness in the us economy has now spread to europe and asia and i think thats what the main concern is
3263992 investors have to realise that if the situation escalates the shutdown in the ports could last a long time and this could start affecting supplies
3263993 to help strengthen national unity and provide momentum for business leaders and all the people to make joint efforts to reinvigorate the economy and create new jobs
3263994 however i made the bold decision considering that business leaders face difficulties travelling abroad and they are being deterred from making new investment
3263995 this amnesty will only strengthen the public belief that the rich always get away with any wrongdoing
3263996 ive got too much life running through my veins going to waste
3263997 people used to constantly complain about windows mobiles lack of ability to work as a reliable alarm clock but that has now been fixed for the most part i find the iphone to be practically worthless at ever waking me up and keep going back to a reliable and loud nokia s60 device to serve as a trustworthy alarm basic functions like this used to be required for a device but we seem to let these issues slide today
3263998 its pretty gruesome graphic and violent i cant believe the mpaa let us go with it

3264000 our development programme is today not optimized according to western spe norms we therefore see this report as a starting point for the work to even more efficiently capture the potential of the license block and to focus our drilling programme on increasing the spe classified reserves
3264001 this is the first time neas has entered into such an extensive agreement with ncc and we hope to expand our cooperation further in the future there is also a potential for further value creation through the agreement by offering neas products to the tenants
3264002 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
3264003 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and not clothed the world in arms is not spending money alone it is spending the sweat of laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children this is not a way of life at all in any true sense under the cloud of threatening war it is humanity hanging from an iron cross
3264004 a matter of time before they ask barack obama and mccain well mccains talked about his past barack obama if hes ever had an affair
3264005 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat
3264006 it is not a happy situation and we did not have to have this situation and i think the bush administration has considerable responsibility for that
3264007 saakashvili was discouraged from attacking russian troops in south ossetia but he clearly never was told point blank if you do it you are on your own
3264008 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3264009 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3264010 when you have very thin relations it doesnt give you a lot of diplomatic tools
3264011 there are not a lot of things in terms of u s russian cooperation that we can threaten to stop that the russians care about
3264012 we need somebody much higher to go to tbilisi to demonstrate to russia that we support this government
3264013 but because it was prose people didnt want to read it
3264014 he actually had a whole list blind babies doctors accidents really horrible stuff
3264015 heath wrote it all down so yeah i can see theres a lot of arkham and midnight in his joker
3264016 david goyer has said they owe a debt to us
3264017 and its really easy to see our influence but at the same time they also created something quite new and extraordinary
3264018 and i think he is going to keep getting better
3264019 a lot of people in the race knew he was not exactly toying around with us the first two swims but saving energy and being a smart racer
3264020 everyone knew he was capable of 52 middle really the race was for second and going into it i knew that peirsol keeps saying it was close but he kind of killed us i got what i hoped for so im very happy
3264021 hes a great guy too he does consider me competition but in a friendly way
3264022 he gave me a private lesson during our training trip in palo alto calif and i learned how he swims it i dont have the shoulder strength to do exactly what he does and the amount of water hes able to pull
3264023 there is some magic in the arizona water and i guess i became a backstroker somehow
3264024 matt has been telling me hes not a backstroker the whole camp but i knew otherwise
3264025 he has a beautiful stroke and he obviously has a great head on his shoulders
3264026 a couple of months ago i dont think anyone thought i was going to make the olympic team especially for an individual event
3264027 i wanted tickets for some of the premium games and i knew i had to get out early
3264028 i didnt do it last year i bought tickets the day of games and i bought tickets a few days or couple of weeks before the big games im afraid theyre going to sell out this year

3264043 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
3264044 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
3264045 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
3264046 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
3264047 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
3264048 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
3264049 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
3264050 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way

3264054 former president of the united states bill clinton was impeached by the house of representatives on december 19 1998 and acquitted by the senate on february 12 1999
3264055 when are you congress person stand up for the rule of law when is principle going to trump expediency when are you going to join kucinich and wexler in calling for impeachment hearings
3264056 we need to move on this just divides people americans are tired of hearing about impeachment
3264057 well youre a bit of a radical most people dont want to see another president impeached

3264060 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3264061 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3264062 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3264063 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3264064 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3264065 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3264066 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3264067 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3264068 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended

3264094 god is the one who loves us not because we are lovable but because he is love not because he needs to receive but because he delights to give
3264095 love endures long and is patient and kind love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy is not boastful or vainglorious and does not display itself haughtily it is not conceited arrogant or inflated with pride it is not rude and does not act unmannerly love does not insist on its own rights or its own way for it is not self seeking it is not touchy fretful or resentful it takes no account of the evil done to it it does not rejoice at injustice or un righteousness but rejoices when truth and justice prevail love bears all things hopes all things believes all things and endures all things love never fails
3264096 so if god is love why is the world so full of pain and suffering why is there unanswered prayer why do bad things happen to good people
3264097 my thoughts are not you thoughts and my ways are not your ways as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
3264098 tribulations worketh patience and patience experience experience hope and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit which is given to us
3264099 ok my son though it grieves me deeply if death is truly what you want i will let you go

3264104 judge peter c dorsey of the united states district court in new haven agreed that the plaintiff robert jordan was denied an opportunity to interview for a police job because of his high test scores but he said that that did not mean mr jordan was a victim of discrimination
3264105 judge dorsey ruled that mr jordan was not denied equal protection because the city of new london applied the same standard to everyone anyone who scored too high was rejected
3264106 i was eliminated on the basis of my intellectual makeup
3264107 its the same as discrimination on the basis of gender or religion or race
3264108 jordan says assistant city manager keith harrigan who oversees hiring for the city told him

3264167 maybe the fact that a virus cant be held in a jpg nowadays is true or so ive heard from various other security forums does that necessarily mean you cant hide it in a bitmap file no or hide it in an exe and tell them its a game or something
3264168 if a rar file can be added to the end of a jpeg i dont see any reason why an executable cant be added to the end of a jpeg other security forums are probably saying you cant bind an executable to a jpeg the person asking if it can be binded often wants a jpeg file that will show a picture and execute the virus when the file is double clicked
3264169 oh this is an image the headers must be at the very beginning of the file

3264174 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3264175 i was out in open water and i was in the outside lane which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3264176 i just wanted to win my race and set everything up for tomorrow

3264183 since he has participated in four games a bronze medal is an historical breakthrough for him
3264184 i am confident of bringing back two gold medals at the games
3264185 i will work hard on every dive instead of caring too much about results
3264186 to help strengthen national unity and provide momentum for business leaders and all the people to make joint efforts to reinvigorate the economy and create new jobs
3264187 however i made the bold decision considering that business leaders face difficulties travelling abroad and they are being deterred from making new investment
3264188 this amnesty will only strengthen the public belief that the rich always get away with any wrongdoing
3264189 make ubs more effective and agile in managing trends in the financial industry
3264190 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3264191 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity

3264193 the georgians must agree to sign agreements on the non use of force with the ossetians and with the abkhazians
3264194 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3264195 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3264196 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3264197 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3264208 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation

3264210 the international community collectively held their breath waiting for the reaction of russia after the savage brutal criminal attack by georgia on south ossetia
3264211 after having offered a cease fire in hostilities the back stabbing georgians immediately violated the cease fire invading south ossetia and causing massive destruction and death among innocent civilians among peacekeepers and also destroying a hospital

3264218 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct
3264219 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3264220 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3264221 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3264222 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3264223 been issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer
3264224 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3264225 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3264226 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3264227 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3264228 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007
3264229 green investing is emerging as the new theme for the region
3264230 it is not hard to discover why the recent world wealth report by merrill lynch estimated that about 20 per cent of wealthy investors in the middle east had already allocated part of their portfolios to green technologies and alternative energy the highest proportion of any region in the world
3264231 private equity and venture capital is clearly becoming increasingly important in the process of diversification away from oil and gas
3264232 the wealth report also found that while half of those in the west who had invested in green technologies had done so out of a sense of social responsibility in the middle east two thirds said it was because of the potential high returns regional investors have identified a new source of income

3264246 i was supporting spain during the final and at arsenal everyone was really happy for him everyone accepts cesc needs a little more time because he only came back at the end of the month
3264247 only spain played really well at euro 2008 rather ignoring the fluid football of holland russia turkey and others the implication being that england who failed to qualify were actually not that far behind
3264248 the best team won the euros because spain played with confidence but only after their quarter final game against italy did they play with a lot of confidence
3264249 the other teams and countries played with a lot of spirit the level of the players is good but we are at the same level or better but we have to play with this spirit we have to play with a lot of confidence im sure we will do so
3264250 i have a lot of confidence in my team because in the three games i saw at the euros only spain played really well
3264251 the players played very well with their clubs but im sure theyll play very well in an england team
3264252 croatia played good enough at the euros they played with spirit pride in their country patriotism but we are ready to win against croatia i will be in south africa for sure
3264253 i will announce the captain the day before the game and i will speak with the captain just a moment before the announcement is made at the team hotel said capello of the duel between ferdinand and john terry for the armband
3264254 i know a lot of players who smoke it depends if he smokes five cigarettes or 20

3264265 these funds will be transferred by the palestinian authority of mahmud abbas they are for paying the salaries of abbass people
3264266 except where payments are self executing under the california constitution the state has no authority to pay state employees their full salaries where it does not have an appropriation such as in this case where there is no budget for fiscal year 2008 2009
3264267 the governor has created a solution to a problem that does not exist
3264268 rather than focus on building consensus for a budget that addresses californias long term fiscal problems the governor seems adamant on picking a fight over whether state employees are entitled to the wages they have worked for and earned
3264269 were still talking we havent thrown anything at each other

3264272 avoiding mosquito bites is the best way to avoid becoming infected with west nile virus mississippians need to be careful and take steps to protect themselves and their families
3264273 we talk to counties every time there is a new case
3264274 it may be something that has to be looked at over time
3264275 those are typically things you would go to the doctor for anyway though
3264276 er worden minder criminele feiten geregistreerd maar ze brengen wel meer schade toe
3264277 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3264278 weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences
3264279 so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that are playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3264280 its nice to be known for something good like that
3264281 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3264282 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3264283 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend
3264284 if ever there was a golf course you could discount a poor round this would be the one
3264285 would i have liked both of them to have played better of course
3264286 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3264287 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them
3264288 i believe what sen mccain is proposing is totally totally wrong
3264289 keeping them out of the g8 russia is a major superpower we have to build the kind of relationship with russia so that we can deal with them on restraining iran from building nuclear weapons so that we can deal with russia in the middle east help us in the situation in iraq
3264290 sen mccain wants to isolate russia further thats not going to work that will make russia more detrimental in the relationship with the united states
3264291 john mccains top foreign policy adviser lobbied for and has a vested interest in the republic of georgia and mccain has mirrored the position advocated by the government
3264292 take steps to ease tensions with georgia by reversing recently announced measures that undermine georgias internationally recognized sovereignty which have rightly caused great concern among our european allies
3264293 those are countries whose advantage it is to point the finger at a russian threat particularly georgia
3264294 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare
3264295 in a large employer base it wouldnt be at all unusual to find half a dozen or more people working there who may have a caring role for people with early dementia or a range of situations in the adult area
3264296 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers
3264297 deep down you hope this is the level you can attain
3264298 this is what ive dreamed of being considered one of the best in the world
3264299 if shalane stays shalane and stays simple shes going to be great i think shell become americas best distance runner ever and she may already be

3264303 the ethiopian officials dont allow me to train in ethiopia any longer
3264304 i train now at high altitudes in turkey as i think that some of my former compatriots see me as a threat
3264305 i will try to put my heart and soul into trying to beat her when im on the starting line but she is the pre race favorite because she is the world record holder by a substantial margin coming into this race
3264306 you keep an eye on all competition and you also know that the chinese women are going to put on a great show because of the pride theyre going to have representing the home country as well as the three returning medalists from athens
3264307 the race of the games quite possibly of any games
3264308 we have entered a new era of mens sprinting spearheaded by a super elite who have broken away from the rest and are taking the sport to unimaginable heights
3264309 the first and second rounds will reveal whether he is still carrying the injury and gay knows more than anyone that he needs to send out an early message to his rivals to win the 100 metres it is important to make your presence felt by dominating from the start
3264310 ill always look for robles with the times hes run this year as consistent as hes been as fluent as hes been
3264311 his leg speed is incredible he maintains it very well and how much more leg speed he can gain is a question but id say not much
3264312 this is obviously not the mountain air of home but i also have the feeling that the air quality here is much better than it was during my last stay in february im not suffering
3264313 it was really my win at the tokyo marathon in february that showed me what i was truly capable of i dont think i now have to be scared of anyone or believe anyone is better than me in beijing
3264314 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey
3264315 we do find that many countries flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate

3264318 the infrastructure was pretty much a hodge podge of different disparate pieces and systems that had been cobbled together by a couple of previous is directors so basically it was a swamp
3264319 i was looking for a monitoring surveillance tool that would allow me to identify detect and troubleshoot problems long before the phones started ringing or the executives beat me up in the hallways because the network was down
3264320 i had tremendous success with groundwork while working for another company
3264321 because of the fact it was open source it was far cheaper the company itself was a great implementer and the tool was geared towards the type of monitoring surveillance that i needed in my business thats ultimately why i selected it a lot of it was price driven but there was a lot of functionality decisions that i made based on groundwork groundwork requires far far less support than most of the other primary proprietary software vendors
3264322 at the end of the day it allowed me to get out of the 80 availability circus that was going on here
3264323 were at four 9s now 99 99 and have been four 9s over the last three years the second benefit was with care and feeding some of the major proprietary software packages that ive rolled out have required a one or two headcount on a dedicated basis right now we think managing the groundwork solution is about one third of one persons time per year another of the more compelling benefits that we were able to derive was people remain far more productive because there was far less downtime with the systems
3264324 businesses are doing a lot of intelligent things with open source solutions by wrapping other software packages around them and making them solutions instead of just software packages id encourage my peers to be more comfortable with open source solutions
3264325 wouldnt it be nice to get some nuts to go along with that beer
3264326 you know that your kid has been been sticking his hands into all the candy bins for the last 5 minutes and taking out handfuls
3264327 you obviously dont have kids look the supermarket knows that kids do this and expects it its not a big deal
3264328 i dont think its as much an issue of him eating the candy as that its unsanitary
3264329 all men have the stars but they are not the same things for different people but all these stars are silent you you alone will have the stars as no one else has them

3264335 no matter whether you are a man or a woman you were born at a bad time on a bad day in a bad month in a bad year under a very bad star
3264336 if there is the so called next life i beg god to let me be an ordinary man or an ordinary woman whatever gender it may be but to be as normal as other people it seems a very simple dream but for me and my friends being normal is impossible
3264337 i could not pretend to love a woman just to maintain family happiness
3264338 it would have been torture i cannot live like that i cannot be another person rather than myself i cannot hurt a woman just to cover myself
3264339 you must be very courageous to rob a beloved son from his parents and to give them back a distorted creature
3264340 only now can i really understand that gays are normal people in terms of health and intellect we are only different in terms of our sexual tendency

3264349 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3264350 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3264351 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3264352 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3264353 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3264354 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3264355 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3264356 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3264357 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3264358 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3264359 i lost my mama i went through so much drama i went through so much drama im for obama
3264360 its not a black or white thing its not a rap or rock and roll thing

3264362 i hope you had a good time f that the time of your life
3264363 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3264364 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3264365 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3264366 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3264367 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3264368 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3264369 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3264370 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3264371 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3264372 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3264373 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3264374 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3264375 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3264376 the line was so long i was like what is this
3264377 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3264378 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3264379 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3264380 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3264381 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3264382 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3264383 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3264384 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3264385 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3264386 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3264387 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3264388 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3264389 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3264390 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3264391 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3264392 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3264393 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3264394 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3264395 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3264396 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3264397 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3264398 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3264399 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3264400 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3264401 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3264402 im a simple cheerful and friendly woman with great passion in writing
3264403 the new building will be an inspiring place for them to study embodying all the principles taught within it

3264406 there is not one single cement company on this planet that is not thinking about how to reduce emissions
3264407 but there is also a great advantage to the mass production
3264408 any small change you make to it has a big impact on co2 emissions
3264409 rice husks are really not available worldwide in amounts that will make a difference
3264410 as people begin to recognize just how much more sustainable concrete is in terms of saving energy were going to see cement demand and production go up
3264411 that makes one think that nature can create at 37 celsius a material that has similar properties as cement

3264428 we cant get to where we lose our cool out here its that time of year guys arent in very good moods out here weve just got to make sure we continue to get better its good to see us compete and those things well get rid of the extracurricular stuff it wasnt anything big a couple of little ones
3264429 we were anticipating it and we need that as a football team
3264430 after a while it kind of got excessive as far as the banging and guys trying us we needed that thats something were trying to build on is our toughness and at the same time build on our mental toughness
3264431 you know this defense were a tough rough defense we dont back down from anybody and thats how weve always played
3264432 ever since that day that lance schulters gave us that nickname the tennessee tyrants thats what weve been trying to live up to
3264433 hes definitely a guy weve got to pay attention to the next two days
3264434 man i wanted to watch the other field i wanted to go over there so bad
3264435 so the only difference really is that the chinese government gets to have its way without interference from left liberal aclu feminist moonbat journalists or other troop haters they can just lock up their enemies or kill them and make lots of money in the united states its not so simple i think its inaccurate to characterize americans as either brave lovers of liberty or ignorant docile sheep the truth is more really a diffuse mixture of both with many shades in between our history has always displayed a tension between the belief in obedience to the status quo and a striving for individuality and justice the status quo has almost always had the upper hand but the other aspect hasnt died out yet either the curious thing is that leaving aside the voicing of political views americans are generally accustomed to saying whatever they want some form of rebellion seems to always take shape in the culture

3264444 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

3264655 this is a major advance in xcels energy efficiency programs
3264656 the two year proposal should save consumers and businesses over 500 million net while reducing fuel use and cutting pollutant emissions
3264657 energy efficiency is the low hanging fruit and will help participants in the programs by immediately lowering their utility bills if in fact the programs are cost effective
3264658 these investments are directed at making homes buildings appliances and equipment more efficient
3264659 were proud of the homes weve built in denver but unfortunately it does not fit our long term strategic objectives
3264660 its good in the long run because many of these large builders can afford to offer incentives that many of the smaller ones cannot
3264661 its been tough for small builders for a long time to buy small groups of lots
3264662 developers typically want to sell to someone whos going to buy lots and keep buying lots and buy lots in bulk now big builders dont want to buy in bulk and developers may think it makes more sense to sell to smaller builders

3264672 so far there has been no drop in spending because of the olympic games and certain events in fact for some media there has been strong growth in terms of outdoor and digital advertising

3264728 since he has participated in four games a bronze medal is an historical breakthrough for him
3264729 we have not ruled out every known species but we have looked at those species known to live in that area
3264730 there are so many reports of yeti like beasts across south and central asia that i would not be surprised if there are still some pockets of these very very rare and shy creatures
3264731 we would welcome more tourists but we dont want to lie to them in the name of the mande burung
3264732 i believe 100 per cent there is something i will not say it is mande burung because we have not found it but as long as there is no proof we will keep looking
3264733 there are many stories in our myths about elves or whatever but the mande burung is not part of that folklore
3264734 the creature was on the rock he was playing with a stone hitting it against the rock it was black
3264735 it was just a few seconds that i saw it i was very scared
3264736 we are not going to give up until we find it

3264739 if it werent for the savings that we have netted from energy management and the four day work week we would not have been able to do several of the vital things that are going to help us attract and retain even more students
3264740 it was a great thing for me because i became a full time faculty
3264741 the fact that i have that day that one day its just so much nicer and i just dont have to drive all that way to cocoa

3264750 bn bertanding di permatang pauh disebabkan adanya pilihan raya kecil di kawasan itu setiap kali ada pilihan raya kecil kita akan bertanding dan bn tidak pernah tidak bertanding dalam pilihan raya kecil
3264751 kita sedar keadaan di permatang pauh tetapi pengundi wajar diberi pilihan siapa yang akan menjadi wakil rakyat mereka
3264752 saya dinasihatkan tidak memberi sebarang komen kepada media cuma kita akan bagi kerjasama kepada bpr tak ada masalah terhadap siasatan yang dijalankan
3264753 saya tak boleh nak mengesahkan yang itu tindakan bpr mengambil dokumen dari pejabat pmbk pagi semalam kerana turut berada dalam bilik mesyuarat tadi
3264754 kita tidak umumkan tarikh pilihan raya kecil itu dan saya juga tidak mengarah supaya tarikh itu serentak
3264755 jika spr tidak umum tarikh mereka akan kata kita bimbang takut lambat umum ni apa pasal tempoh 60 hari untuk pilihan raya kecil boleh masuk bulan kedua akan ada macam macam soalan buat awal pun timbul soalan
3264756 ada juga orang kata mungkin peletakan jawatan datin seri dr wan azizah ismail sebagai ahli parlimen permatang pauh untuk tawarkan anwar jadi calon itu sebagai satu helah mudah mudahan dengan itu anwar tidak dibawa ke mahkamah tidak dituduh ada orang cakap macam itu

3264758 dari segi undang undang pada masa ini beliau layak bertanding pada pilihan raya kecil 26 ogos ini

3264770 we hope it will impact how cities look at their trees
3264771 obviously a lot of cities havent yet stepped back and said why do we do this the way we do it
3264772 we need to look at ordinances across multiple states and see if there are common features we havent done that
3264773 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3264774 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3264775 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3264776 these findings raise the possibility that alzheimers disease may contribute to frailty or that frailty and alzheimers disease share a common cause we theorize that the accumulation of these plaques and tangles in the brain could affect the areas of the brain responsible for motor skills and simple movements years before the development of dementia
3264777 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
3264778 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
3264779 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
3264780 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
3264781 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
3264782 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
3264783 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3264784 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3264785 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment

3264864 i think this has become a total farce it makes a mockery of the law
3264865 it is utterly outrageous that the money paid by hard working taxpayers is being squandered on council propaganda that hardly anyone reads

3264870 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3264871 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3264872 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3264873 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3264874 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3264875 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3264876 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3264919 are now available in north america still made by hand in a four day process with a recipe over 300 years old and with much of the original equipment
3264920 i think its something that no one should ever have to go through
3264921 my first thought was obviously how do i get there ive got to get to my wife and ive got to support her
3264922 lifes not fair but its never going to be about that kind of stuff
3264923 at the end of day it happened and it seems the sooner we can come to grips with that the better off were going to be
3264924 you get things done on these walks besides getting healthier
3264925 so i want to try to use walking to improve the health of the community at the same time it gets me next to people with everyday issues
3264926 at the council meeting im wearing a suit and ive got my public persona on and every time someone comes up to the podium you dont know if its a good thing or a bad thing and you have your veil up
3264927 it really connects you to what matters to real people
3264928 i bring in chris he writes down notes and soon the problem is solved
3264929 each microchip has a scannable bar code that tells who owns it
3264930 the odds are that we wont microchip every plant but it will have a deterrent effect
3264931 the city decided to stop apologizing for the desert and said we live in the desert it is what it is
3264932 we have seized 15 to 20 barrels at a time
3264933 they have a very shallow root system and can be popped out pretty easily people have been digging them up in broad daylight
3264934 in some cases the thieves work for landscapers and in other cases they are independent contractors who sell the saguaro to legitimate commercial operations
3264935 depending on the size and shape or if it has arms they sell for anywhere from 500 to 5 000 or more each
3264936 once or twice a year we encounter people with shovels and pickup trucks trying to steal cactus
3264937 you can see the cumulative impact of 60 years of this kind of thing along some park roads where all of a sudden there are no barrel cactus
3264938 we dont have a problem with thefts anymore maybe because we have armed rangers patrolling everywhere
3264939 these are probably worth 150 or 200 each i think the economy is driving a lot of this if it isnt nailed down they are going to take it
3264940 we are trying to be in the forefront of water wise planting and are cutting down on our lush vegetation a lot of people are getting away from lawns and turf in favor of desert landscaping a golden barrel 3 or 4 feet across is worth 4 500 or more you pay by the inch
3264941 there has always been plant theft but now it has escalated
3264942 it has increased because a landscaper has a job to do and with the slowdown in the economy he may look for cheaper prices i have heard that some of these thieves sell plants on street corners now
3264943 that was a huge performance boy did he knock it out of the park
3264944 we really needed that pommel horse routine and he hit it big time
3264945 after all we went through to get here we did amazingly well
3264946 all we said was be consistent be consistent they did a tremendous job
3264947 when you look at the guys that are out on the floor these are the guys that have been fighting through the trenches the last three years on the international level
3264948 we kept saying this was a team of nine and we almost needed them all artemev and raj really came through
3264949 one of the most dangerous people the state could have
3264950 is no more than the average citizen in the community
3264951 it speaks volumes about how this market was hijacked by investors who pushed the market up and now they are pushing it down
3264952 i expected wed have a bit of a reaction today
3264953 theres an overall view in the market right now that demand is really cratering
3264954 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle
3264955 and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
3264956 if it was three bucks a gallon i think people would change their buying habits
3264957 i think the shift in buyer attitudes weve seen this time because of gas prices is the most dramatic in all the time ive been in the business
3264958 this one has made a permanent mark on peoples memories
3264959 highlighting the importance of keeping our eye on the ball during this brief reprieve from higher oil prices
3264960 but in terms of here on the pool deck i can say the pressure is off once the games start
3264961 its pretty thrilling its such a great accomplishment a big thrill to put someone on the team everyone on the club enjoys the recognition and the glory
3264962 his intention was to develop a nationally recognized program and he had a lot of support to do that
3264963 the authorities responsible for policing these kinds of things ought to review these allegations and if there is any merit to it delve into it and get to the bottom of it
3264964 the ability to investigate based on almost any source of information including media reports
3264965 well take a look at things and see where we go from there
3264966 it would be unfair of us to comment on this matter since we are unaware and have not been involved with the internal decisions made by that organization
3264967 long beach residents and children deserve nothing less than access to a downtown library with ready access to books and programs to help them achieve their goals
3264968 remove access to over 1 5 million books from one square mile of the city
3264969 it makes me think that long beach city manager pat west and possibly mayor bob foster do not understand the core mission of a civic library
3264970 the main library is one of the only things left in this city thats free
3264971 everybody needs to take a step back and get the facts right
3264972 what if the bond measure fails what if they decide to build the new library someplace else
3264973 they are offering a temporary site but what will it look like how big will it be where will it be located
3264974 a friend of mine works at the long beach library and she loves to talk about the lives it has uplifted over the past 20 years
3264975 the new library will be a lot smaller than the existing one
3264976 the one we have now is almost as big as the union bank building across the street
3264977 modern libraries given their access to the internet and other technologies are smaller and more efficient
3264978 we will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this
3264979 in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3264980 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3264981 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia
3264982 inflicted damage on operational systems troops and military facilities of georgia
3264983 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3264984 during their mop up operations in south ossetia georgian commandos have thrown hand grenades into the basements where civilians were hiding
3264985 he bowed his head folded his hands which he then rested his forehead upon and began to ask a blessing
3264986 and i know you went to visit with her after the funeral franklin it meant a lot to her
3264987 no i dont think i have its nice to meet you dr pendergrass ive heard a lot about your church
3264988 so when are you breaking ground on the new facility
3264989 were breaking ground in two weeks parson its going to be a big day the lords really blessing us
3264990 you folks are going to be busy how many services do you have each week
3264991 thats probably three times more that your pope following friend
3264992 youll have to excuse me franklin i have to get to a meeting with the er folks
3264993 i was just thinking how busy you must be with three services
3264994 thats what father edward told me franklin he has ten services each week
3264995 this was a targeted killing an assassination no water cannon were used to disperse the crowd no rubber bullets blood was spilt by the authorities like water
3264996 we must be allowed to attend the proper burial of our colleague
3264997 reportedly the movement of trucks to and from the kashmir valley is being blocked this has serious humanitarian implications
3264998 pakistan calls for immediate steps to address the situation and prevent the human rights violations in the indian occupied jammu and kashmir
3264999 the family had last seen him about noon family members had gone to the grocery store and left him at home
3265000 when the family came home around one his wifes cousin found him lying on the floor in the basement near a treadmill the treadmill was running so it is believed that he had been working out
3265001 there doesnt seem to be any foul play we dont see anything suspicious about his death there will be a further statement from the hospital about the cause of death
3265002 the united states which ranked 16th and has the worlds largest economy has largely stalled in happiness gains this despite ever more buying power americans are now twice as rich as they were in 1950 but no happier according to a new survey
3265003 overconsumption is a major factor in environmental degradation global warming chief among them could a wrong headed approach to seeking happiness then be exacerbating some of the worlds most pressing environmental problems and could learning to be truly content help mitigate them
3265004 people martin seligman a happiness expert notes are often happiest when helping other people when engaged in
3265005 for their part psychologists are advocating that policymakers use indicators other than the gross national product gnp to make decisions whats the purpose of an economy they ask if not to enhance the well being of its citizenry
3265006 sometimes we will talk with them about someplace else they might be safe
3265007 we see people at all hours of the day and night
3265008 its tragic that women and children have been sent elsewhere for lack of space
3265009 it will be a place where women can work on different parts of their lives move forward and start fresh
3265010 you ask me do i think e21 is working and i would have to say unequivocally yes
3265011 but it really needs to be a thoughtful one that looks at different factors before you reach a conclusion
3265012 i guess i would look at the glass as half full rather than half empty
3265013 thats not to say we dont continue working on whats going to make us better
3265014 i use her as a way in to see how people are feeling
3265015 what are their fears when it comes to the state rules
3265016 there was no information about nail salons you thought everything was your fault as a manicurist
3265017 there were fireworks because it was the 4th of july i didnt know anything
3265018 i thought there must be a party every day in america
3265019 nail salon workers felt for the first time that people cared about us
3265020 they still want me to do something that is more financially well off
3265021 but they understand more now in terms of what i do and why i work with community
3265022 lange tijd heeft de iliad het in europa voor het zeggen gehad als het aan amazon ligt komt daar vanaf dit najaar verandering in met de komst van de kindle volgens ingewijden zal de kindle zijn opwachting doen tijdens de bekende boekenbeurs in frankfurt
3265023 enrollment is growing far faster than any of us could have imagined it would
3265024 we have a commanding need and we would not be doing our job if we did not present this to the voters
3265025 he use to say it was the greatest country on earth
3265026 she wanted a place to get away that was beautiful by the water where we could all be together
3265027 there were hardly any cars out i wasnt the perfect driver but you wonder whether this is really safety enforcement or is this an indirect tax
3265028 that is what the red light program is designed to do
3265029 were going to go by that in deciding where to monitor right turns
3265030 those are pretty minor accidents where you almost come to a stop and roll through
3265031 were looking at where you get your big accidents where cars are making left turns or going straight through at 30 miles per hour
3265032 usually served at dinner in with or after the soup fish or meats which constitute the principal part of the repast and not like fruits generally as dessert
3265033 bookstores are the space of our democracy theyre vital to the communities theyre in
3265034 we have to keep doing it we have to be advocates and never give up
3265035 its hard not to do what you really care about
3265036 its a shorter period for us but well work around it i would rather see all the kids get an elective
3265037 and guess what its going to look different the next time you draw yourself because i have some things to teach you
3265038 they would get two periods of math while their friends were able to have art or music or something fun
3265039 its the first day i want to hear you guys sing
3265040 remember you only have three minutes to get to your next class so no dallying around
3265041 id be comfortable flying with either of them at any time
3265042 the difference with other communities in the country is that we are giving nothing to the developer or cabelas for coming here
3265043 i dont believe there are any penalties built into this development agreement
3265044 i wasnt satisfied with the process used to get to this junction
3265045 why have a deadline if there are no consequences and were not going to hold them to it
3265046 the mmia may say yeah youre right you dont have to give us anything if we say to them that we dont owe anything
3265047 the approval of the subdivision likely resolves the lawsuit with the city
3265048 it does not resolve the issues that initiated the lawsuit the issue of city protection for their favored engineer engineering inc and favored developer wells and the citys willingness to shield parties that break agreements and break laws remains
3265049 my family and i visited every other summer or so
3265050 my grandmother and cousins are still in tunisia and my grandfather was a well known political leader
3265051 its a beautiful country rich in history culture and traditions
3265052 at the time womens pole vaulting had been around for only a few years
3265053 i was lucky because montana was one of the first states to allow womens pole vaulting and my high school was very supportive
3265054 she is one of the best technical pole vaulters ive ever seen
3265055 last year she jumped great and shes been steadily improving thats when we started focusing on the olympic games
3265056 it would be great to pull out a solid performance
3265057 if i can make the finals it would be fantastic
3265058 im a montana resident so the wwami program was my first choice
3265059 wwami has a rural focus and having grown up in the eastern part of montana thats something id probably like to go back to
3265060 medical school will be my primary focus from now on
3265061 im very excited and thrilled to represent not only tunisia but my home state of montana
3265062 at this point going from 1 800 to 5 200 we just cant do it
3265063 when it went up two or three years ago we had to ask everyone family members to chip in
3265064 suddenly its 5 200 were retired where are we going to get that money
3265065 theyre seniors and veterans and people whove had their cabins in the family for five generations
3265066 there are ants spiders bugs and mice and the road is actually plowed shut in the winter
3265067 were six miles from big sky where the rich folks live
3265068 theyre forcing people out and only those with big money will be able to come in but who do you think with big money would stay in a cabin with no running water
3265069 if you were any buyer with common sense why would you buy it
3265070 were dismayed that theyre using data from a year ago
3265071 they dont take into account any changes in the market since then
3265072 my job as an appraiser is to be unbiased to get an impartial unbiased look at the market and come up with a market value
3265073 across the forest id say in general the trend was up
3265074 but in the hebgen district there was one tract that went down
3265075 the public is entitled to a fair return on their money
3265076 the forest service thought 5 percent was a fair return
3265077 thats a shame we see too many of the ranches in montana going that way
3265078 the forest service should think about how can we keep these people in these cabins
3265079 it does work they agreed with me but the average person doesnt understand what to look for at least i did
3265080 were privileged to have a cabin in the forest were lucky
3265081 which is fine it helped save the cabin were very appreciative of what they did some were not so lucky
3265082 we enjoy being on public land but when you pencil it out per day it is rather expensive to keep and why is there such a discrepancy in value from our neighbors who are so close by
3265083 but we do not believe that the implementation of cuffa complies with the intent of the act
3265084 what looked theoretically like a good fair appraisal system was probably flawed from the outset
3265085 its a lose lose for everybody if this problem isnt addressed quickly
3265086 we need much cleaner alternative like hydrogen powered vehicles etc
3265087 the team is very excited to have luka on the team
3265088 he should bring some pretty good speed to the team
3265089 its a very long process for an international student to be granted a student visa to the united states
3265090 when youre recruiting as many kids as we do things happen
3265091 he told our staff that he is going to go the junior college route in pursuing his dreams of playing division i again
3265092 were excited about the returnees and the new kids that we have coming in thats what were focused on
3265093 that was a great honor but i just want to get better
3265094 thats my main goal as well as the offense if all of us get better that would be perfect
3265095 this program needs to go in a new direction and thats what were here to do
3265096 we have the seniors and the coaching staff and everything feels great
3265097 its always so good to be back on the field
3265098 i love it on the first day youre excited nervous just everything
3265099 those two and theres quite a few others out there have been around so you can lean on them a little more
3265100 but being a punt returner is a lot of adrenaline they kick the ball you catch the ball and theres so many people gunning for you youve just got to stay out of their way
3265101 everyone has been working hard this summer in the weight room its really going to show this year i think
3265102 the biggest thing i like about the defense is just everyone wants to get to the ball and help make the play
3265103 weve got some good quarterbacks our o line is coming back strong
3265104 we have some depth at the wide outs weve just got depth everywhere weve got some strong players and i think well do a lot better
3265105 id love to be an all american but the biggest thing is i want to go to the playoffs
3265106 were still knocking off a little bit of rust no matter what you do in the offseason its not the same until you get in pads and run around you can train all you want but until you get out there its still different
3265107 maybe we gave them a little more information than we gave them last year at this time we still have to bring some young guys along
3265108 thats whats good about this team if one guy doesnt get it done the next guy is there to pick him up if were down were coming back
3265109 its unfortunate in the last week or so it seems like errors have been biting us at inopportune times
3265110 were a pretty good defensive team but days like this are just going to happen
3265111 you have to look past it and then the next day youve got to get it done
3265112 for us the implication is that the state is moving right up toward the limit for pm 10 so how much more development is going to be permissible in this area
3265113 if theres an issue on these things they deq will review it
3265114 david and his staff have done an extraordinary job for us there
3265115 the way the world is today kids are more likely to sit on their couches using their mp3 players than get out
3265116 were trying to counteract that by getting them out on these short courses and then out on longer courses
3265117 the slope was not a real steep slope but he was not able to stop his sliding before he went over the edge and took the fall
3265118 our rangers have told me that the snowcover is significant still and its pretty sloppy because of warming temperatures
3265119 it gets pretty soft and slushy and can give easily
3265120 the change of use isnt just the widening of the road the change of use is anything goes
3265121 i think people should be aware of it and i think for the most part they probably are not
3265122 when you go into the center you think about things that make you sad or unhappy and when you get to the center you leave them there in the basket in the center
3265123 she made it to the center shes leaving her problems there now and walking out
3265124 they made it real clear what they had picked for their art
3265125 i walk that slowly sometimes when im kind of balancing on a bar or something like that
3265126 it was something that was unexpected and im just very honored that they would consider me for something like that
3265127 best was honored for her outstanding advocacy in the trial of steve feuersteins claim against the city of billings
3265128 have demonstrated selflessness integrity bravery or remarkable character in vindicating the rights of all montanans to protection from wrongful injury compensation according to fault honesty and accountability in government
3265129 i think a lot of people around the state thought that about him
3265130 he just knew he had to do the right thing our civil justice system is at its best when it challenges the powerful and thats what he did
3265131 we feel like our team overall has been held back by our defense
3265132 we got hit in the mouth and acted like someone took our lunch money
3265133 the kids get a majority of the credit because theyve really taken ownership of what we want to do defensively
3265134 the first thing we addressed in fall camp was if you want to be put in the category of great teams then you have to consistently play good defense
3265135 energy excitement and passion that has rubbed off on our players
3265136 weve got a great defensive coordinator he changed the whole mentality of the defense its just what we needed
3265137 a clear mind means fast legs and a cloudy mind means slow legs
3265138 we will eliminate things quicker than we will add things
3265139 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3265140 weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences
3265141 so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that are playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3265142 its nice to be known for something good like that
3265143 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3265144 hes got that kind of demeanor that you need on the ryder cup team
3265145 you need a bunch of different type of personalities for a ryder cup team to blend
3265146 if ever there was a golf course you could discount a poor round this would be the one
3265147 would i have liked both of them to have played better of course
3265148 if i knew i didnt have a chance to go medal or win i dont know if i would have continued on
3265149 its about winning the gold medal she went over there for one reason thats to get the gold in the time trail
3265150 everything weve done is to be focused on time trial
3265151 she is feeling good and confident about the time trial albeit a little stressed
3265152 in the olympics unless you end up with the gold medal or silver or bronze thats good too nobody remembers
3265153 it will still take some time before i start full training although the recovery process is going on fully and in the last week i was able to play with the ball after a long time
3265154 it has still been just light kicking as i cant kick properly
3265155 i felt i wasnt safe and that meant that my family wasnt safe
3265156 when i arrived here i went to the office of the un high commissioner for refugees unhcr and talked to them about my case but i had no proof that i had worked with the u s army
3265157 a year later i lost the hope to start over things werent moving and i wondered what i could do
3265158 i put the name of the american commanding officer i worked with at al waleed in google and i couldnt believe it when i found him and saw his picture
3265159 if it werent for you many of my soldiers would have died
3265160 now in the streets of jordan i walk like this
3265161 but sometimes im still afraid i will be sent back to iraq i always think about this always
3265162 wir m ssen eben kreativ sein und nicht immer nur an lohnnebenkosten denken sondern an verm genszuw chse und spekulationsgewinne die in den vergangenen jahren enorm gestiegen sind
3265163 i didnt even do that at wimbledon i lost serve at least once a match so that i didnt lose serve yet is a good sign
3265164 i most definitely think that we have improved since athens we just keep getting better and better
3265165 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies
3265166 the focus will now switch to the high cost of raw materials where prices remain elevated despite coming off recent peaks
3265167 the detention of the female journalist goes against the commitment of media freedom by the interim government in
3265168 this is getting out of hand and the fiji media council supported by the people of need to stand united against any threats to freedom of expression and rule of law the interim government needs to respect the rights of its people
3265169 these actions are clearly undermining the forums efforts to assist
3265170 they cannot perform their role if there is continuous intimidation and threats to the profession
3265171 while pina respects the sovereignty of governments in the region it will stand up to any serious attempt to undermine freedom of the media and free speech at the same time we urge our members to exercise prudent and ethical responsibility when reporting on issues
3265172 the south pacific was where greg made his home his enthusiasm and love our region was very evident in the way he went about his work
3265173 was a very humble person and very sensitive to many cultures that make up the membership of the pacific islands forum family
3265174 greg was a strong advocate for the pacific and his passing is a great loss
3265175 greg was one of natures gentlemen who took over the helm of the forum secretariat at an important point in its history guiding the organization through the establishment of the pacific plan aimed at increasing regional cooperation
3265176 as the first non pacific head of the pacific regions premier policy organization greg had much to prove and he was more than equal to the challenge
3265177 criteria include the influence and significance of the artists contribution to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll
3265178 the rock and roll hall of fame and museum stands as a monument to the living heritage of rock and roll music
3265179 music gives us a microphone to speak to the world and music has the power to bring generations nationalities and people together now more than ever its critical to study and understand how music is changing our world as well as reflecting it

3265213 jeans sind wie rock nroll wir h ren nicht auf sie zu lieben
3265214 ich habe mich immer schon gefragt warum bei kinderkleidung der anspruch an stil und design geringer ist als bei erwachsenen
3265215 bevor wir gesch ftsleute sind sind wir doch vor allem eltern deshalb wissen wir ganz genau wie wichtig gl cklichsein unbeschwertheit und die richtige erziehung f r ein kind sind

3265230 if this proposed legislation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3265231 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3265232 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3265233 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3265234 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3265235 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3265236 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3265237 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3265238 substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3265239 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3265240 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
3265241 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to

3265245 lenovo has engineered a new breed of mobile workstation with the thinkpad w700
3265246 no other pc manufacturer has a mobile workstation that delivers the sheer power performance and cutting edge innovation that lenovo has packed into the thinkpad w700 the thinkpad w700 mobile workstation flat out delivers the command performance our customers demand at the desk as well as in the field
3265247 our engineers use lenovo thinkstation workstations to help them design the next generation williams toyota fw31 race cars aiming to make them faster and more agile with greater performance than the competition
3265248 were thrilled to see lenovo deliver the workstation performance weve come to rely on now in a mobile portable solution
3265249 its become clear that demand is cratering which is making it hard to rally
3265250 its hard to imagine that the market will shrug off the potential loss of 1 million barrels a day of pretty good quality crude but that appears to be the case
3265251 i think we are looking at a significant change in market sentiment
3265252 we are really only focusing on the bearish aspects of a dramatic slowdown in demand and increased supplies
3265253 the primary driving factor of the market is the sluggish economy
3265254 we are looking for any evidence that the economic contagion in the u s and western europe is spreading to the far east where demand has been strong the chinese demand numbers may be a sign that demand is starting to flag in asia
3265255 the threat to caspian oil supplies appears to have been written off
3265256 there will have to be a more frightening development in the caucasus or some other trouble spot to make this market rally
3265257 boeing will need to do everything in its power to maximize the competitive balance of that rfp
3265258 there is absolutely no way that they could do that
3265259 been and continues to cooperate fully with the regulators and has been working with clients since february to provide liquidity on a case by case basis
3265260 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3265261 i think we can look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3265262 we have long believed the impact of the rebate checks would be short lived similar to what occurred when rebates were distributed during the recession of 2001
3265263 rebates might have been a third of the growth in real spending
3265264 given that we had these rebates growth was still quite sluggish
3265265 when we go down to our basements or our garages it makes us as happy as some of the finest art in the world
3265266 but as a bike nut i dont find it hard to justify at all
3265267 you might as well get a bike that just performs really well isnt super fancy and gets the job done because youre going to keep it for a year then throw it away and get a new one
3265268 is for someone who appreciates the aesthetics of bicycles and takes a lot of pride in what theyre riding
3265269 ten years ago 3 000 was a lot of money
3265270 was to get the people who already rode a high priced bike to buy a higher priced bike
3265271 the people driving this high end business arent your typical bike commuter
3265272 they arent helping the environment or saving money by buying these high priced bikes theyre doing it because its a fashion statement for them within their circle of friends and acquaintances who happen to be other bikeys
3265273 kindle could be one of the top gadget gifts this holiday season
3265274 we are very excited about our growth in seattle and our two planned stores in interbay and west seattle are going ahead
3265275 people are shopping very cautiously and less frequently avoiding impulse buys which are what magazine purchases are
3265276 domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months
3265277 it reinforces the view that the economy will be weak in the next several months and there will be renewed pressure on the fed to start easing again
3265278 when the fed started to cut rates mortgage rates and other rates were actually lower than they are today
3265279 to say that things are easier in many areas of credit would be a mistake
3265280 when times are tough the herd starts running in the other direction with tougher standards pretty much across the board
3265281 within the last three months weve had multiple companies racing each other through the doors
3265282 when we typically have little mountain ranges every time the air moves past its pushed up and over
3265283 theyre testing to see whether or not its sufficient for wind power development
3265284 oregon in the next couple of years will move from around ninth in the country for wind power production to maybe third
3265285 we may not have as much as people would like us to have available
3265286 you put up meteorological poles all over the place to test the wind because the one thing you can never mitigate for is bad wind
3265287 what youre looking for in wind energy is geographic diversity
3265288 where theres a big concentration of wind right now it peaks in the spring
3265289 the best and cheapest way to meet the renewable requirements is to do a majority of wind
3265290 i know there are at least four companies that have had some interest within harney county and i know that theres a minimum of 10 sites that at first glance they say might be doable
3265291 a lot of this has been what if until this point
3265292 what i hear is pretty positive support for having sustainable energy for getting away from dependence on foreign oil and the job creation
3265293 the landowner told me that this may provide his family with the opportunity to keep an old time ranch in one piece in their family for several generations
3265294 and that beats the heck out of 100 different ranchettes
3265295 to that extent were starting to get ready from a logistical standpoint
3265296 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3265297 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3265298 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3265299 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies
3265300 the focus will now switch to the high cost of raw materials where prices remain elevated despite coming off recent peaks

3265306 while homeowners and businesses continue to embrace solar energy at a tremendous rate this growth is somehow restricted by the relatively limited number of consumers who are exposed to solar in their daily lives
3265307 the savings from avoiding unnecessary power to idle monitors processors and peripherals is compelling
3265308 environmental leadership is good for business and good for the planet

3265310 in these difficult economic times the american red cross of the national capital area is committed to the conservation of needed energy we must conserve resources in order to have the capacity to help those in desperate need of our services
3265311 we extend special thanks to citrix hp and intel for their initiative and for the donation of much needed funds to the red cross
3265312 today remote management technology enables it departments to update computers even when theyre turned off so increasingly theres no advantage to leaving computers on overnight
3265313 instead the economic and ecological advantages of turning computers off are compelling
3265314 microsoft is excited to have the support of wyse a global leader in thin client technology for its windows embedded standard 2009 technology
3265315 embedded devices are increasingly becoming smarter and by pairing wyses expertise in thin computing with microsofts command of the embedded os we will be able to provide the most advanced solution experience for end users
3265316 with the benefits of reduced it administration combined with energy reduction lower carbon emissions and longer life span thin clients continue to provide attractive alternatives in flexible computing in the enterprise
3265317 we are excited that windows embedded standard 2009 provides the leading platform for a new generation of thin clients for our customers
3265318 power and cooling reduction has always been a strong driver for our server virtualization efforts
3265319 virtual irons new livepower is taking those benefits beyond the savings seen from server consolidation by enabling users to automate and optimize their power usage through its management platform
3265320 virtual irons adoption of intel r virtualization technologies and the upcoming intel r node manager will deliver new levels of virtualization and power management capabilities for it
3265321 virtual iron is one of only two vendors in the market that provides a true server virtualization solution with the capabilities of our virtual infrastructure management platform
3265322 today we have thousands of customer deployments supporting a wide range of applications from test and development to mission critical environments livepower is another important capability that exemplifies the depth and value of the virtual iron solution
3265323 i have large boobs and a sizable a so i guess the title comes with the territory
3265324 it could provide power for 300 000 homes each power station and our vision is that australias a suitable place for this and we could build up to 34 of these power stations by 2020
3265325 the ideal location for a thermal solar power station is a desert type location you want maximum solar with the least cloud cover or interference and our dry desert locations are ideal

3265372 maar als daardoor water en zouten bij de metalen wapening komen gaat deze roesten roest neemt meer ruimte in dan staal waardoor het omliggende beton verbrokkelt dan heb je in n klap twee problemen het beton kan minder goed drukkrachten opnemen en de roestende wapening vangt de trekkrachten die op de constructie worden uitgeoefend slechter op reparatie of preventie van betonrot is kostbaar en niet altijd mogelijk denk aan ondergrondse betonconstructies
3265373 dat bracht ons op de gedachte om bacteri n al bij het gieten van beton in te sluiten als bij beschadigingen water zou binnendringen moeten die kleine organismen automatisch worden aangezet om kalksteen als een soort reparatiemortel af te scheiden en daarmee de scheuren te dichten
3265374 ik ging op zoek naar bacteri n die in vergelijkbare omstandigheden leven en vond twee soorten die geschikt leken bacteri n die leven in siberische sodameren in rusland die sterk alkalisch zijn en in steen levende bacteri n die ik in spanje vond
3265375 sporen kun je beschouwen als een soort zaad waarmee bacteri n in extreme omstandigheden zoals droogte en voedseltekort kunnen overleven er zijn micro organismen gevonden waarvan de sporen na 200 jaar nog levensvatbaar waren meer dan voldoende voor het gebruik in beton
3265376 het is beslist geen enge soort je kunt hem in iedere achtertuin aantreffen
3265377 vooral dat laatste is ideaal omdat dan de kalksteenproductie in principe oneindig kan doorgaan en we geen stoffen hoeven toe te voegen die het beton verzwakken
3265378 we hebben technieken ontwikkeld waarmee we in korte tijd de verbetering van de houdbaarheid over een veel langere periode kunnen bepalen
3265379 ik kreeg laatst een dramatisch amerikaans rapport onder ogen waarin gesteld werd dat maar liefst 50 procent van de bruggen aldaar onmiddellijk onderhoud vereist omdat ze min of meer op instorten staan een enorm kostbare aangelegenheid dan zou zelfhelend beton een uitkomst zijn

3265412 a lot of the calls are for willis side of the defense the weak side
3265413 its the more physical position than what patrick plays meaning he has to take on bigger guards
3265414 but i wouldnt necessarily call it dirty work its a more physical position ill say it that way
3265415 i havent missed a practice for a while three years

3265443 the infrastructure was pretty much a hodge podge of different disparate pieces and systems that had been cobbled together by a couple of previous is directors so basically it was a swamp
3265444 i was looking for a monitoring surveillance tool that would allow me to identify detect and troubleshoot problems long before the phones started ringing or the executives beat me up in the hallways because the network was down
3265445 i had tremendous success with groundwork while working for another company
3265446 because of the fact it was open source it was far cheaper the company itself was a great implementer and the tool was geared towards the type of monitoring surveillance that i needed in my business thats ultimately why i selected it a lot of it was price driven but there was a lot of functionality decisions that i made based on groundwork groundwork requires far far less support than most of the other primary proprietary software vendors
3265447 at the end of the day it allowed me to get out of the 80 availability circus that was going on here
3265448 were at four 9s now 99 99 and have been four 9s over the last three years the second benefit was with care and feeding some of the major proprietary software packages that ive rolled out have required a one or two headcount on a dedicated basis right now we think managing the groundwork solution is about one third of one persons time per year another of the more compelling benefits that we were able to derive was people remain far more productive because there was far less downtime with the systems
3265449 businesses are doing a lot of intelligent things with open source solutions by wrapping other software packages around them and making them solutions instead of just software packages id encourage my peers to be more comfortable with open source solutions
3265450 if i will not grab the opportunity the management of tork will give the business to someone else its a lost opportunity for me
3265451 incidents of this nature are extremely rare in this area

3265460 lamb is my favorite meat by far and lamb thyme currants goat cheese and pine nuts all go really well together all those flavors really meld
3265461 they add just a touch of sweetness to it its a little tiny burst of sweetness that goes well with the gameyness of the lamb
3265462 the deceleration in cpi inflation is an encouraging development for the authorities as they try to shift their focus to growth from inflation
3265463 theres a temptation to read this as a sign that inflation is easing but in fact inflation pressure is still firm
3265464 yesterdays high producer price inflation was a warning that inflation pressures remain

3265472 we were coming off a couple of heartbreakers ourselves so i think guys were a little determined to finish this one
3265473 utley gave him a great battle but i swung horrible both pitches were sliders and i just didnt get good wood on it i was swinging over balls and grounding out all night

3265564 to the point that i have to make sure that i dont get his arm sore or anything like that
3265565 especially with the new qbs in here now knowing how they feel trying to learn the offense and defensive backs are flying everywhere they dont know whats going on
3265566 oh very confident im always confident in myself now its just getting more of a rhythm and becoming more and more confident every day
3265567 hes throwing the ball with really good accuracy throwing the ball well deep down the field and hes got good command of the huddle hes making a lot of good decisions
3265568 he can do everything we have in and hes ok with that hes not jake mobility wise but he can move pretty well and hes pretty crafty with his feet
3265569 but i was committed to here and i told coach willingham that i committed to you and im not backing out of it
3265570 that was just people in redlands trying to make chris not come here trying to make a story about me leaving so chris could still go to usc
3265571 me and chris people love us in redlands they wanted us to be successful and wanted him to go to usc because he committed there and everyone was hyped up because he was really the first guy from our city to go to usc they were upset about him decommitting
3265572 im just preparing myself to play whenever my time comes
3265573 they went on a 7 0 run and i looked up and the u s lead was 37
3265574 were not showing everything so that does concern me a little bit
3265575 at the same time weve been tested for two years
3265576 i dont fear these players losing their hunger and their focus with the lopsided wins

3265582 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3265583 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3265584 i was just hoping i was going the right direction
3265585 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3265586 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention
3265587 but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3265588 a lot of guys have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3265589 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh
3265590 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter
3265591 one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3265592 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3265593 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3265594 mayroon po kaming nakalaan na pera para sa panganganak ni jen kasi nga naibenta namin yung bahay sa north view yun na ang panggastos namin sapat pa naman yon
3265595 wala naman physical preparations e more on emotional and psychological preparation lalo na ang pagle labor ang mga ganoon bagay so natatakot pa rin ako
3265596 i am prepared para sa lahat for my delivery for my child lahat wala dapat ipag alala
3265597 siyempre alam namin na may limitations i mean nandito lang kami para suportahan si jen at para tulungan si jen at para maging maganda din ang pagpapalaki sa baby
3265598 feeling ko nga na maraming nae excite na if ever na magkaroon ulit ng love team kami ni jen hindi natin masabi panahon din ang makakasabi doon
3265599 gusto ko na makita noong magiging baby at alam ko na guwapo
3265600 mayroon po kaming nakalaan na pera para sa panganganak ni jen kasi nga naibenta namin yung bahay sa north view yun na ang panggastos namin sapat pa naman yon nangyari noon nung biglaan namin nalaman na akala na manganganak sa hindi oras e natakot ako pero noong lumabas si jen ay kaya pa naman namin magbayad
3265601 parang ayokong huwag siguro kasi ako wala din ako alam about the contract e
3265602 pagdating sa business hindi ako nakikialam si tita becky aguila jennylyns manager diyan pa rin kami kapuso pa rin
3265603 just to go up to the line have all your butterflies and then just trust those women in your boat and really pull out a calm and efficient race it just gives you a lot of confidence
3265604 so we pretty much got as close to race ready yesterday and i think that helped us visualize it
3265605 especially going down hearing the crowd seeing the jumbotron it was a great race rehearsal
3265606 i fenced my best my opponent is an elite competitor who fenced very well
3265607 to come off the terrible month that we had in cincinnati and you get a phone call today saying youre being traded to a first place team as a player thats all you could ask for
3265608 bonds is not a fit for us if he would come i would go i wouldnt want to deal with it
3265609 fishing was good in marine area 9 during the first couple of days in august but the catch slowed significantly in the last week
3265610 your father my son i love him more than anything in the world but hes a god damn republican
3265611 we are going to take on an underdog role in this ryder cup for the first time in a long time even on paper when you look at the strength of the european squad
3265612 ive said all along that experience while being very important i mean weve lost five of the last six ryder cups so most of their experiences are bad experiences
3265613 so its not like experience is going to be a great help im looking for guys that are playing well its as simple as that and if its an experienced player playing well then i think thats fantastic
3265614 its nice to be known for something good like that
3265615 and to be part of a winning ryder cup team thats the last memory i have of it personally so hopefully i can bring some of that into the locker room and have a positive influence on the event
3265616 at this level everybody is so prepared physically and the level of gymnastics is so high but it comes down a lot of times to your nerves
3265617 i dont think we will see the same situation in the team finals
3265618 she physically is unscathed but having to deal with this incident has been hard for her shes shown incredible strength and over the last couple of days weve been able to talk our way through it
3265619 there have been a lot of tears and a lot of hugs but the fact that shes able to address what happened is a testament to whatever you want to call it her intestinal fortitude her strength is her character
3265620 volleyball is my job and my family is my life so thats been a very easy distinction to make for me
3265621 the opportunity will be here for him to return once
3265622 the opportunity will be here for him to return once his family issues have been resolved
3265623 for the time being that needs to be his focus
3265624 bobbys a very important part of what we do offensively but injuries are a part of this thing you deal with it the younguns have to step up and play weve said that already and now they just have to do it for a while
3265625 you cant mess around because we have two receivers that are going to be on the roster that might not be playing when the season starts so you have to keep those guys
3265626 are line drives that would normally be doubles hell get the power hes still young and he has strength through the zone
3265627 to be tied for the most olympic gold medals is pretty amazing
3265628 i mean the olympics have been around for a long time its definitely an honor i spent some time with carl lewis and exchanged some words here and there with spitz so thats pretty amazing
3265629 but you know what its pretty cool to say that i was in that race its not every day you say you get to swim in an olympics final and then to add that you swam against michael phelps
3265630 when i watch him i see a lot of natural talent obviously
3265631 but he also has amazing focus watching him warm up he has such amazing attention to detail he knows exactly what hes going to do and how hes going to do it and he knows that before every race
3265632 and when he gets challenged he knows how to deviate from that plan it seems like he can always find something else in his tank and get home faster than everyone else
3265633 its just a honor just to be swimming with that guy to be a part of his history
3265634 hes doing some unbelievable things out there making even the best swimmers in the world look at him in awe
3265635 to swim in a race where he went that fast just to be a part of that is really amazing i mean ive never seen an athlete like him before
3265636 you have to improve on areas of your race that are his strength like turns
3265637 i mean maybe your swim can be as fast as his but if he gets a body length on you in the turns its not going to matter
3265638 i know a lot of people are trying hard to find ways to beat him but it doesnt look like its working
3265639 you have two receivers who are going to be on the roster but might not be playing
3265640 youve got to keep those guys so you cant really fiddle around with that number too much in fact you might have to add a number to it
3265641 yes in case youre wondering it is the loudest horn in the history of basketball arenas
3265642 you know what i disagree with if you do feel that way saying it publicly
3265643 theres no way of telling how do you tell if a guy is playing for himself i dont think thats a fair comment to be honest i just dont see that and if i did see it i wouldnt tell you if i had a problem with someone id walk up and tell him thats how id approach it
3265644 you do find yourself feeding off the energy other teams bring
3265645 its nice to play teams that are in contention because they bring that energy and i think it elevates your game
3265646 it didnt even look like we belonged on the same field
3265647 hopefully whether its consciously or subconsciously it does sink into them that every game weve played i think the other team has said man we have our hands full with that other group over there
3265648 thats kind of looking for the silver lining i guess we have to take pride in the fact were battling but we just have to get over the hump and start winning more of those games
3265649 you play to win no matter whats going on you play the game the same way whether youre in first place or last place whether youre playing for that last spot in the wild card or 25 games out
3265650 its easier said than done but its necessary as a professional its necessary its what youre supposed to do regardless of whats going on around you you have to ignore the circumstances and get after it thats my take theres always something to play for
3265651 it was good for me to go out there and get banged around a little bit
3265652 its just a question of how many of them can make that significant jump at the same time
3265653 when i was laying there on the field thats the most scared ive ever been
3265654 i feel like im ready to go out there and actually show what first round is
3265655 at this point its water under the bridge theres no reason to dwell on it
3265656 im thankful that things worked out where i was able to stay and be the starting quarterback here when its all said and done thats what really matters to me
3265657 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3265658 if youre not looking you may get hit in the head
3265659 i want to do something like criminal justice or criminology because i just love csi and those kinds of shows it would be cool to be a detective
3265660 probably playing video games or basketball or just hanging out with my homies watching tv
3265661 ncaa 09 ill play the huskies a lot but i like texas tech with that wide open offense
3265662 ive got to boost up my stats a little theyve got me on there not wearing gloves which he does and i put on a visor got to make me look cool
3265663 i want to make the all pac 10 first team or get some kind of accolades at the end of the year thats what i really want to do
3265664 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3265665 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3265666 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this am i angry we find ourselves in the situation we find ourselves in yes
3265667 this is not a fun week the galaxy hasnt made the playoffs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable it starts thursday
3265668 i think this was a tough move professionally and personally for ruud
3265669 i dont think it was working out for him and his family
3265670 come si fa a non diventare padroni di un paese di servitori
3265671 is the citys future for mixed use projects and entertainment
3265672 we have to turn what was a real estate office into a pet sanctuary thats a major undertaking
3265673 i dont want to give it up even though im an old guy
3265674 were thinking it will be leased by a corporate executive or a lobbyist
3265675 virtually all production has been shut down because of this
3265676 that was always identified as a huge potential risk for this project
3265677 it demonstrates what the worlds addiction to oil results in
3265678 how the crazy cynical left or right of the political spectrum is going to misuse the information
3265679 i had 10 or 15 people on my team two thirds lawyers a couple accountants a couple regular people
3265680 we looked at taxes and financial statements political positions and the most distasteful part personal behavior
3265681 every piece of paper i could put my hands on
3265682 we turned over 30 banker boxes full of material to a law firm in d c
3265683 if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it
3265684 but we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offence
3265685 we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature but it is quite a complex matter and we cant just make a judgement on the spot
3265686 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3265687 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3265688 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3265689 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3265690 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3265691 it isnt true that we have loaned vagner love to everton
3265692 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3265693 maar de brinkenweg is nu een jachtveld geworden voor automobilisten en motorrijders die het leuk vinden om zo hard mogelijk te rijden
3265694 during the holiday season when our card balances are usually high credit card companies often send offers which invite us to skip a payment
3265695 the sub prime mortgage fiasco and its effect on our investments prompted us to reconsider our portfolios risk tolerance capability
3265696 to boost their profits credit card companies often lure their clients by sending lucrative offers with lower minimum payments on debts
3265697 with each passing day the cost of college education is rising
3265698 we found a very pithy article at fool com by robert brokamp about dilberts views on personal finance the essence of the article is quoted
3265699 cash is king when its not a debt but has been accumulated as a result of our savings and like convenience checks cash advances from our credit card accounts is a terrible mistake we should avoid it at all costs top resources for early retirement planning
3265700 in order to diversify a portfolio many experts suggest adding a few sector funds or etfs
3265701 it is a known fact that credit card companies attract new clients by advertising low
3265702 aprs newbies might think that aprs on their balances are fixed till they pay it off right no dear we are nowhere near the truth
3265703 no matter what our professional domains are we often face these two obstacles when we start out inexperience and credibility
3265704 while studying the performance of a stock or mutual fund we invariably come across these two terms
3265705 if we have a good credit history well receive plenty of 0 apr offers for new cards from reputed credit card companies congrats beware of the fine print though perhaps its time to grab a magnifying glass and read the fine print well
3265706 while browsing through the archives of vanguards plain talk on investing podcast series we came upon an interesting podcast that explains ways to measure a funds performance
3265707 famous for its ceo giving out his social security number in advertising and national press lifelock is the only identity theft prevention solution backed by a one million dollar guarantee
3265708 in our college days there were hardly any credit cards that offered cash back rewards to get an unsecured credit card which was by itself a big deal but citi has eased it for present day college students with mtvu platinum select visa it offers
3265709 for folks like us who travel a lot from coast to coast through major us metropolitans citis hilton honors visa offers great savings in the form of rewards points
3265710 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3265711 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3265712 mac wanted to be sure that both the ungaro designer collection and its fall mac color collection called cult of cherry had different points of view cult of cherry is inspired by dark rich chocolates and cherry red shades while the ungaro collection is about femininity and uses lighter textures
3265713 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3265714 leidy viviana you are my sister and i love you jake tells this young woman from manizales colombia
3265715 on par with signifying the helpers status as equal in the household
3265716 child care is the most difficult issue in parenting says jakes mom laurie johnson 43
3265717 we did all of it day care a private nanny they were not for us we decided an au pair was the next route
3265718 we thought it would be a great opportunity for us and especially jake to be exposed to someone from another culture another part of the world mike says
3265719 shes here to see our culture and experience the united states before she returns to colombia laurie says
3265720 we want her to have as much fun as she can
3265721 she doesnt cook for us unless she wants to laurie says adding
3265722 flexibility is a big benefit as well as exposure to another culture nichols says
3265723 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3265724 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3265725 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams
3265726 its difficult for them to realize this one game friday night is not as important as my cognitive ability the rest of my life
3265727 everybody is scrambling to get out of the ship before the guy next to them
3265728 why do we think we can try to change what god created without disrespecting the creator
3265729 part of showing the love of god is to care for creation mans first profession was to tend the garden
3265730 when a child marks a piece of paper with crayons you hang it on the refrigerator no matter what you think of it
3265731 simple living is kind of one of those deep brethren values
3265732 part of simple living is to live in harmony with everybody else and with nature
3265733 when you walk across this it is a lot cooler even the walkways
3265734 they were trying to make me triple all my estimates which would have resulted in 10 000 to 12 000 more in development fees
3265735 his wings are fixed to keep him from flying so he never learned how
3265736 he lives in a cage because he never learned to fly
3265737 the roots of this tragedy lie in the decision of georgias separatist leaders in 1991 to abolish south ossetian autonomy this turned out to be a time bomb for georgias territorial integrity each time successive georgian leaders tried to impose their will by force both in south ossetia and in abkhazia where the issues of autonomy are similar it only made the situation worse new wounds aggravated old injuries
3265738 we know something needs to be done because they arent succeeding that well with standard methods of classroom instruction on this campus
3265739 give us a wider range of teaching styles and learning options for the students of this campus not just the traditional lecture
3265740 even though im selling it for 8 000 less than the kelley blue book value ive gotten maybe five calls and all of them were no shows
3265741 im trying to get rid of the trucks i have now but im having a hell of a time doing it
3265742 its anything v 8 the market has just been dead all over town
3265743 a lot of people are staying away from gas hogs if they have a big family theyll buy a minivan instead of a chevrolet suburban or just suck it up and buy a car
3265744 it is purely miles per gallon they ask whats the fuel efficiency
3265745 we get a lot of calls on hondas and toyotas small imports and small domestics as well
3265746 across the board all of them even import suvs like the toyota sequoia and honda pilot
3265747 i get some people that come in to trade down to a smaller car but they have so much negative equity in the suv or truck they have to decide if a trade is worth it or if they should just pay the gas prices
3265748 the toyota prius is still on back order all over arizona
3265749 the truck market is best in places where there is a lot of construction and growth which tucson happens to be they might hold value a little better there but not enough to make a difference
3265750 as soon as we hit 4 a gallon full size sales went down there was an absolute mindset at that number
3265751 we see a lot of trucks and suvs at the auctions but that doesnt mean anyones buying them
3265752 in june compact car prices had a mileage adjusted year over year price gain of 12 7 percent while large pickups and suvs both had annual declines in excess of 25 percent
3265753 even bigger shifts for particular models and powertrain based on fuel efficiency were seen
3265754 i bought a house and needed to get rid of the truck payment its been two months i get an average of one call a week
3265755 with all the promotions and incentives new car dealers are offering now there might not be a better time to buy
3265756 the rosy side is that if you go to the lake and need a truck to pull your boat you can literally save thousands
3265757 even though there is reduced demand someone is still going to want an suv or truck
3265758 at first we thought it got hit by a car
3265759 this is a really dramatic example of how animals like people can burn
3265760 a common misconception is that animals have fur and its going to protect them
3265761 a lot of animals are found after its too late
3265762 field officers tell me its a grotesque find the molecules that hold the tissues together starts to disintegrate in the sun literally the skin starts sloughing off right in their hands
3265763 tie outs are one of the predominant calls we get
3265764 b derne vil v re de samme som i dag men flere vil f et klip i kortet men f rst og fremmest vil klipzoner have en god pr ventiv virkning overfor folk der k rer for st rkt p udsatte str kninger
3265765 we will solve the problem of insurgency in the island of negros before this year ends
3265766 the investment environment turned more cautious due to concerns about global financial market fragilities and the downturn in many advanced economies including the united states
3265767 it is in progress and hopefully before the year ends we will launch it for now we own 100 percent of the venture
3265768 my performance is okay but i am sad because i did not reach my target 110 in the clean and jerk which could have improved my score to 200

3265773 if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it
3265774 but we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offence
3265775 we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature but it is quite a complex matter and we cant just make a judgement on the spot

3265778 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3265779 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up the sting
3265780 he acknowledged that he came over based on the text messages that were sent to him to have sex with a 15 and 17 year old girl
3265781 in 1qfy09 iobs net interest income reported marginal growth of 2 4 y o y to rs 7 3 billion against our estimates of rs 7 5 billion lesser nii was mainly due to increase in cost of funds by 38 basis points compared to 11 bps decline in yield on funds
3265782 we reduce our net profit estimates for fy09 and fy10 by 13 and 18 respectively and reduce our price target by 23 to rs 165 we maintain our buy rating on the stock with a target price of rs 165 at 1 47x adjusted book value fy2010
3265783 ambuja cements acl is trading at a forward p e of 10 5x and 9 4x for cy08e and cy09e respectively on the ev ebitda basis the stock is trading at 6 9x and 6 1x for cy08e and cy09e respectively we have valued the company by using dcf analysis assuming a 15 6 cost of equity and a 5 terminal growth rate our fair value estimate of rs 69 is 22 less than the current market price of rs 88 3 therefore we reiterate our sell rating
3265784 i just wanted to be out there at the 50 metre point and be there at the 100 after that it was just open water
3265785 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens certainly not so much for me im a little bit older than tom so i can take things on the chin a bit
3265786 there was a little incident but it is an olympic games you are in a different world and people are going to do things differently
3265787 he had a pop at me before the last dive i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone
3265788 thats just thomas hes over nervous thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform
3265789 we were out of character tom was nervous and thats what happens certainly not so much for me im a little bit older than tom so i can take things on the chin a bit
3265790 i have seen them around the village and they have looked very calm but i am sure that can happen with the pressure of the event
3265791 they will learn from this though and that is the most important thing

3265801 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3265802 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3265803 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3265804 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into
3265805 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3265806 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean
3265807 this technology is incredible if i hadnt been present i wouldnt have believed it i looked across the fields and just saw grass and trees but in reality i was staring down the barrel of a tank gun

3265825 during our selection process we had a strict set of criteria for our application in space

3265828 ich bin ein wenig entt uscht denn es w re toll gewesen das rennen hier als neunter zu beenden aber unf lle passieren eben und niemand hatte schuld mein ziel war es heute das erste bmw bike im ziel zu sein thomas und ich haben das geschafft abgesehen von dem sturz hatten wir keine probleme und das bike sowie das ganze team haben tolle arbeit geleistet dieses rennen war viel h rter als das im vergangenen jahr erstens gab in unserer klasse viel mehr starke konkurrenz und zweitens hat das rennen in diesem jahr anstatt 24 stunden nur acht stunden gedauert acht stunden bedeuten einen sprint und das ist f r unser motorrad nicht wirklich geeignet ich denke alles in allem haben wir gute arbeit geleistet
3265829 der unfall ist so schnell passiert ich konnte nichts mehr machen ich denke ich bin in der kurve etwas weit nach au en auf die wei e linie und auf den dort liegenden schmutz gekommen das heck ist dann gleich ausgebrochen und das bike hat mich abgeworfen gl cklicherweise konnte ich gleich wieder aufsteigen und weiterfahren aber der sturz hat mich drei pl tze gekostet das tut mir leid aber davon abgesehen ist das motorrad besser gefahren als im letzten jahr das team hat wieder einmal gro artige arbeit geleistet und die boxenstopps sind super gelaufen ich h tte ein 24 stunden rennen bevorzugt ich denke dass wir da eine gr ere chance auf einen besseren platz gehabt h tten aber es waren eben acht stunden die wir fahren mussten und wir wurden trotzdem erster und zweiter in unserer klasse au erdem gab es viel mehr starke teams als im vergangenen jahr
3265830 im allgemeinen bin ich froh dass wir erster und zweiter in unserer klasse geworden sind aber ich hatte gehofft dass wir das rennen unter den topten beenden k nnen in einem acht stunden rennen ist das immer eine harte aufgabe besonders wenn man die st rke der konkurrenten ber cksichtigt ich war zufrieden mit meinem ersten durchgang weniger mit meinem zweiten weil ich viel mehr druck auf meine bremsen aus ben musste vielleicht brauche ich einfach mehr kraft in meinen h nden da gregory gut in der dunkelheit f hrt hatten wir beschlossen ihn das rennen zu ende fahren zu lassen das hat gut funktioniert ich denke richard ist gut gefahren und hat gezeigt dass sein bike gut ist und noch f r einige berraschungen sorgen kann unsere boxenstopps waren sehr beeindruckend das team hat das ganze wochenende ber gro artig gearbeitet
3265831 das ist heute ein hartes rennen gewesen da es ein acht stunden sprint und kein 24 stunden marathon war mit all den extra gegnern in unserer klasse war es nicht einfach zu gewinnen aber wir haben den ersten und zweiten platz nach hause gefahren mehr kann man nicht erwarten wir hatten w hrend der acht stunden keinerlei probleme und obwohl wir nicht wie erhofft einen platz unter den topten erreichen konnten haben wir gezeigt dass ein zweizylinder immer noch mit den gro en jungs mithalten kann wir haben es den anderen nicht leicht gemacht
3265832 ich habe es wirklich genossen aber ich h tte mir gew nscht dass das rennen ber 24 stunden gegangen w re ich liebe es in der dunkelheit zu fahren und ich habe da drau en gro en spa gehabt das ganze team war wunderbar wir haben es der guten teamarbeit zu verdanken dass wir als erster und zweiter in unserer klasse die ziellinie berquert haben das ist kein schlechtes ergebnis wenn man ber cksichtigt wie viele starke konkurrenten im rennen waren das ergebnis ist gut f r bmw und ich hoffe dass beim n chsten rennen wieder an mich gedacht wird
3265833 vorab ich freue mich ber die ergebnisse wir h tten in unserer klasse kein besseres ergebnis erzielen k nnen als den ersten und zweiten platz und das haben wir geschafft ein acht stunden sprint kommt unserem bike nicht unbedingt entgegen aber jeder hat hart gearbeitet und die teamarbeit hat uns geholfen dieses gute ergebnis einzufahren nach unserem pech in le mans war es gro artig das rennen mit pl tzen auf dem podium zu beenden der unfall von thomas war ungl cklich aber letztendlich ist er unverletzt geblieben und konnte weiterfahren das war das einzige problem das eines unserer bikes w hrend des rennens hatte ich freue mich dass wir das rennen als schnellstes nichtjapanisches bike und schnellster zweizylinder beendet haben es waren heute 22 wettbewerber in unserer klasse und viele von diesen waren starke teams aus der deutschen meisterschaft insofern ist das ein gro er erfolg und es zeigt dass die hp2 sport ein sehr gutes bike ist

3265844 from the current situation an urgent task for the chinese team is to reduce pressure on its athletes we should not let the athletes and coaches shoulder such heavy psychological burden suffer such great psychological pressure

3265852 im very glad that the team members were able to remain cool and give their best
3265853 i feel i have shed a huge burden by winning the team gold and can now compete in a relaxed mood in the individual event
3265854 i think the team members worked very hard and we won this silver as a result
3265855 we were quite confident and performed as one and i am happy with how we competed
3265856 any finish on the medal podium is special especially as those guys are incredible athletes and are irreplaceable

3265933 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
3265934 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3265935 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3265936 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u
3265937 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3265938 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3265939 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3265940 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia

3265975 the international health terminology standards development organization in copenhagen denmark has released its second enhancement this year of the snomed ct clinical terminology

3265977 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3265978 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3265979 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3265980 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3265981 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007

3266002 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey

3266028 there is a real sense of energy flowing through the gorgon project participants and team and a determination to deliver on the development of this world class resource
3266029 incorporate a domestic gas phase as part of our foundation project
3266030 under our state agreement with the wa government we were initially planning to submit a proposal for development of a 300 tj per day domestic gas plant by 31 december 2010 but we now plan to accelerate this to coincide with our development proposals to government for the lng phase
3266031 that means when we consider fid final investment decision we will consider fid for both lng and domestic gas with the domestic gas plant ready for start up to coincide at or around the commissioning of the projects third lng train
3266032 bringing on gorgons domestic gas phase earlier will increase the number of supply points for domestic gas into wa and has been welcomed by the state government
3266033 in december the project endorsed a change in scope from two to three 5mtpa million tonnes per annum lng trains and a final investment decision is expected after approval has been provided by the state and commonwealth for the gorgon projects third train proposal

3266047 it sounds simple but both teams made mistakes on sunday its been a while since weve seen two teams so neck and neck
3266048 in a few years theyre going to have one of the better stops on tour with what theyve got for a course
3266049 its a little different golf course than what were used to seeing because for me you really only need driver for nos 14 and 15 and 18
3266050 i cant see any hole on the front where i need it its not going to be about distance this week whoever wins here is going to have to be very creative around the greens
3266051 a lot of old courses are modified where they take out the mowing patterns and let the bunkers grow over through the years but this this is something different
3266052 its like i took a step back in time and im seeing what donald ross saw all those years back
3266053 were really counting on the word getting out about this place
3266054 theres just so much going for us here and it starts with the course
3266055 the rough certainly wont be as bad here but the greens are going to be nice and fast
3266056 you have to come in to them at the right angle or theres going to be trouble
3266057 as a junior i remember that we played carson newman pretty much for the conference south atlantic championship
3266058 but this is a lot bigger than that even if it is preseason in my mind this was huge because i had to perform if i wanted to stay here
3266059 it turned out that i got quite a bit of action
3266060 i got more than i wanted to get actually because when i was running those deep routes during that 2 minute drill before the half i thought that thing was going to pop on me
3266061 some buddies from college were here my girlfriend was here the little cousins were here the aunts and uncles were here the granddaddy the mom and dad
3266062 and grew to hosting 300 to 400 youth between our 3 sites
3266063 but the condition of these peoples houses still shocked me
3266064 to see the circumstances some of these people live in
3266065 can change the way someone views a whole race of people
3266066 the children are precious and really eager to learn about god
3266067 it helped me realize as a teen that when i start to get selfish that i can stop and think wow i really have a lot
3266068 how can these people be so loving when they are in such poverty
3266069 its unbelievable to see the circumstances some of these people live in and yet they are so thankful for all god has provided for them
3266070 all these families have is each other and what comes first in their eyes is family and that is what i learned from this trip
3266071 its not what you have but who you have right next to you that matters in the end
3266072 it would be unfair to consumers with accounts at other firms as well as to the firms that settled if our investigation were to slow down or stop
3266073 goodyear did an excellent job im their biggest critic at times they can do things right at times you still got to see the race you get to see guys who are a lot out of their element and thats fun its fun to watch those drivers adapt
3266074 that stuff happens all the time all the time because thats in the heat of the moment its competitive theres sweat running down your forehead this is a decision making business that you have to do now not always are you going to make the right decisions and you never know what the right decision is until the whole thing unfolds
3266075 its kind of tough to get into one with limited carries
3266076 if you love the game of football youll keep going as long as you can to make a team
3266077 guys have been working hard and getting out here and beating the bushes
3266078 he was coming this way back to his home and he ditched the vehicle and jumped and ran
3266079 this is a situation where you have a man being as blatant as he was with marked patrol cars we are concerned what he might do to the general public
3266080 last night about 2 oclock he shared with me that hes as committed as ever to continue the process of peace making and unity making
3266081 were not convinced that an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is the way forward
3266082 i am 12 and i live across the street in those apartments
3266083 i have no money but i need this sir please will you let me have this
3266084 surviving the storm the life of a child in foster care
3266085 i see all these people talking with you so you must be important
3266086 ive never seen this young man i dont know him but i do forgive him
3266087 id like to say im sorry for betty thomas family
3266088 im sorry for being in the area im sorry for the death
3266089 its not a bad idea from time to time sometimes you forget to speak to the choir and they dont work as hard as they did
3266090 this looks like a great year for republicans in north carolina
3266091 this is the first time that north carolina republicans have had as strong a ticket at the top as they do at the bottom and i mean that from the council of state seats all the way up to the presidency
3266092 this again emphasizes which one of these candidates has the experience
3266093 what would obama do and what would mccain do people will make a judgment
3266094 i hope mccain can pull it off but i fear if the election were tomorrow that we would lose
3266095 with the passage of each recent day i feel better about mccain things may break for us yet but as i go around my district i feel more and more mccrory could be elected governor

3266109 la sociedad est cansada de que haya anulaciones de licencias que despu s por razones de capacidad financiera tengamos que legalizar sin que pase nada con sus autores
3266110 una cat strofe econ mica para las arcas municipales es conveniente buscar una soluci n y evitar el problema financiero
3266111 llevamos diez a os quej ndonos por el botell n y ahora resulta que es el propio concello el que concede las licencias para que conciertos como el del domingo de violadores del verso en el n utico no terminen hasta las tres de la ma ana
3266112 desde los hoteles tambi n se quejan porque sus clientes no pueden dormir
3266113 el concello es el primero que debe cumplir la normativa ac stica
3266114 si el gobierno local no toma medidas es decir no traslada los conciertos a otros lugares presentaremos una queja en el valedor do cidad n y si hace falta presentaremos un contencioso administrativo se van a utilizar todos los medios los vecinos estamos dispuestos a firmar
3266115 aunque finalmente se lo suelen llevar los aficionados o cuando menos los que ya la han probado otras veces
3266116 my no 1 goal would be for us to get our swagger back
3266117 there was a time when we were kings if you wanted a championship you had to come through greensboro to get it and you had to fight like hell to get it were going back to those days thats it
3266118 going back to dr ronald mcnair to elvin bethea if you sit down and talk with them they will tell you they all went through the same thing when times were a little tough around here you couldnt get a good meal or there was something wrong with the dorm room or the classroom but there was always somebody there to lend a hand to pull you up to straighten you up and get you going in the direction you needed to go
3266119 we really had an outstanding pool of finalists for this position
3266120 but mr brown continued to rise this was his moment his occasion his opportunity to demonstrate what he can do as a leader for our institution
3266121 hes a man who can be followed hes trustworthy he has worked his way to this position he knows the needs of the coaches and he is the man for the job its not going to turn into rainbows in the sky he knows its a process
3266122 we need your dollars and we need your support aggie pride starts at the hip not at the lip
3266123 now all i have to do is find a way to put gas in it

3266131 the theatre should be a place where you can forget about everything and talk to yourself but the theatre mustnt be a journey to past
3266132 as for me i can successfully work in foreign countries rather than here because the audience is free and easy there here its very hard to start something new without breaking hundreds of old useless standards
3266133 when you lose a race like that phelps finished 3rd in thie event 4 years ago in athens it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3266134 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3266135 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3266136 in that very war kindness and truth struggled against evil love towards liberty violence few nations can be proud of a history that armenia has
3266137 the foreign ministry of armenia is sympathizing with the recent tragic events happened in georgia
3266138 georgian troops have begun an undeclared war against south osetia artsakh nkr south osetia and abkhazia have already gained independence therefore the action of georgian troops is considered as invasion
3266139 finally investors have a bear to get excited about oil now is in unofficial bear market territory with the price of a barrel of crude falling to 115 20 down 21 from its july 3 peak
3266140 we now have some distance from the indymac situation and people are starting to feel more confident about their deposits
3266141 net deposit outflows resume the banks usual sources of liquidity could become depleted
3266142 every indication suggests that while barack obama had a healthy lead early on this race is tightening and oregon might be among just a handful in october that are really competitive
3266143 smith is the last republican standing in a state where democrats now occupy every other statewide office majorities in the state legislature and four out of five congressional seats
3266144 oregon after all hasnt voted for a republican presidential candidate since ronald reagan and has had a democratic governor since 1986 all that said there is a reason why smith is still standing today and the democratic primary in this race allowed smith to capture the center
3266145 there are 643 000 oregonians relying on social security right now and under mccains privatization policy 105 000 of them would be cast into poverty
3266146 if you remove the problem child the financials s amp p earnings have increased by 10

3266203 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
3266204 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
3266205 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
3266206 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
3266207 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker
3266208 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
3266209 i find this genetic sequence all the way down the evolutionary
3266210 you think i dont know this what gives you the right to speak as if you have authority over me you have none i like his use of the words wanton woman they are biblical maybe there is some hope for k man after all you there is no hope for you at all you freak of nature go back to the hole you came out of
3266211 i have no need for sex id rather tease you honeybuns
3266212 chips on you dud you got bugged for being near me viruses transmit that way you know
3266213 the nonsense screeds you compose and post to usenet lack any kind of coherent and rational meaning whatsoever and are composed of random bits and pieces stolen from mythology science fiction religion comic books etc placed into a blender and the switch turned to the highest setting about every other screed has droppings of death threats racial bigotry laughably false prophesies of gloom and doom and inane attempts to extort money these bland meaningless pulpy messes are then trowled into usenet identical or nearly identical screeds are repeated ad nauseum
3266214 q how many bush administration officials does it take to change a light bulb a none there is no need to change anything we made the right decision to stick with that light bulb people who say that it is burned out are giving aid and encouragement to the forces of darkness
3266215 red meat wont hurt you fuzzy blue green meat will
3266216 we are most nearly ourselves when we achieve the seriousness of the child at play
3266217 and thats another mistake on your part your playing games on usenet and im not playing it has nothing to do with impressing you it has more to do with making sure you have the education youll need to debate the debate is no fun for me if you are mentally incapable of it im giving you an opportunity to educate yourself thats all
3266218 but now the end is near now mark foley comes along and is making
3266219 in fact jesus said something about that i do believe
3266220 con espa a s lo hay que negociar la fecha de la independencia de catalu a
3266221 una vez m s se ala este ex diputado de erc en el congreso zapatero se convierte en un farsante m s y una vez m s a los catalanes nos quieren como pagadores
3266222 el psc presentaba enmiendas para recortarlo y semanas despu s artur mas ciu pactaba a solas con zapatero
3266223 zapatero no es de fiar y una y otra vez nos ha enga ado a los catalanes o bien mantenemos la unidad de las fuerzas pol ticas o volveremos a ser barridos
3266224 no hace falta que esperemos nada de bueno y s lo la decisi n mayoritaria de los ciudadanos de nuestro pa s nos permitir avanzar puesto que negociar desde el principio de m s vale p jaro en mano que cien volando con espa a siempre nos cuesta muy caro
3266225 con espa a no se puede negociar si ni siquiera deja hacer una consulta popular en euskadi
3266226 s lo hay que comunicarle el d a y la hora de la declaraci n unilateral y democr tica de independencia
3266227 the group has been highly honored in especially in three nominations spiritual different and modern
3266228 we support the peaceful regulation of the conflict by the participation of the minsk group and we hope that the sides will come to a peaceful conclusion
3266229 lets clap our hands for the president and jesus christ and did i mention charlie manson and everybody else who was nice
3266230 its respectable that malakian does seem to reflect upon todays society in much of the album but then you get to
3266231 lets get ready to rock i piss on your face while you suck on my dick
3266232 when the music comes out it will still be structured just like system of a downs music is
3266233 if were gonna kil each other how we gonna live for ever
3266234 i know its really hard to see that we are the enemy of the earth
3266235 lets f the world with all its trend they say its all about to end
3266236 when you sing lalalalala stona hatez got yo back californias been invaded by a hippy psychopath
3266237 i like i like suicide mixed with jesus christ yeahhh
3266238 i smacked your face you fell in love when i said f your mom
3266239 lets do high five for a genocide and the internet and all the communication skills that are lost when we are dead
3266240 ill piss on your face while you suck on my cock
3266241 if were going to kill each other how are we gonna live forever if were gonna live forever how we going to kill eachother
3266242 their normal contact drill is as soon as they get hit with something then its 360 open up on everything that moves
3266243 we think thats probably what happened and in the meantime a coalition soldier got hit so were trying to stop as many of them as we can sort out if any of them know anything and if theyll admit to it
3266244 the compass convoy is the one we suspect opened up on canadians
3266245 hes lying because before he told me he was shooting
3266246 unless everybody starts telling the truth were arresting all of you you understand
3266247 cant get a straight answer everybody s pointing the finger at everybody else
3266248 without private security firms it would be impossible to achieve what were achieving here
3266249 as an example they secure some of our bases canadian troops couldnt do their job without the help of private security firms
3266250 the only unfortunate thing at the moment there is a tendency for a lot of companies to not adhere to the regulations and the afghan government does not have the ability to be able to regulate them the way they should be regulated
3266251 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3266252 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3266253 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3266254 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3266255 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3266256 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3266257 i turned my head and saw a big burst of fire next to my car
3266258 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of noncombatants in the buildings at that time
3266259 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3266260 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
3266261 we dont give that discount any longer because we already take such a cut on the prices
3266262 lady weve been coming here for 4 years and ive never paid until i picked them up but just to get away from you ill write my check now
3266263 never mind let me get your receipt and time to pick the glasses up
3266264 we have banned a number of mortgage brokers and others this year in connection with mortgage fraud and we will continue to make examples of people who commit mortgage fraud until behaviour changes
3266265 interestingly alzheimers disease pathology was associated with physical frailty in older persons both with and without dementia
3266266 the level of frailty was approximately two times higher in a person with a high level of ad pathology compared with a person with a low level of ad pathology
3266267 together both of these studies suggest that frailty can be an early indicator of alzheimers disease pathology and may appear before memory loss
3266268 a general message from amphibians is that we may have little time to stave off a potential mass extinction
3266269 an ancient organism which has survived past extinctions is telling us that something is wrong right now
3266270 we humans may be doing fine right now but they are doing poorly the question really is whether well listen before its too late
3266271 its important for people to understand whats infecting and killing these frogs
3266272 this disease is a remarkable example of a pathogen jumping boundaries and causing havoc if we can understand how it is able to do so we may be able to help the frogs as well as ourselves
3266273 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3266274 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3266275 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells however those mice were normal
3266276 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved
3266277 the entire process will take almost three weeks and will culminate by september 2 or 3 in case president musharraf refuses to resign
3266278 the georgians have shot down between 18 and 19 russian aircraft and several hundred russian servicemen have been killed
3266279 every time i walk the red carpet shell say oh the hair was a bit too much or shell comment on the shoes i know shes just looking out for my best interests wanting her daughter to shine
3266280 unlike the intravenous drug application of oxycyte in traumatic brain injury this would be a topical application applied to the skin or to the surface of wounds so were hopeful that the clinical review process would be as a medical device which can be shorter and faster than review as a drug
3266281 if the safety efficacy cycle is indeed shorter as i believe it can be then it suggests that substantive partnering models could be launched shortly after safety and efficacy are proven
3266282 our study shows that early weight loss can reduce the risk factors that so often lead to diabetes complications and death
3266283 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3266284 we dont know if the initial weight loss increased the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes were the reason for the long term health benefits
3266285 but we do know that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death in type 2 diabetes patients
3266286 some of these same gene regulatory networks are re activated in the adult to direct the growth of new blood vessels this can be beneficial as in the case of a heart attack
3266287 finding that a single factor regulates a large part of the angiogenic process creates a significant target for therapeutic development for any disease involving the vascular system
3266288 the next step is to find ways to modify this microrna in the setting of disease and test its ability to alter the disease process
3266289 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3266290 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3266291 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3266292 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3266293 its a very sad day to lose him he knew about the business he knew about television he was responsible for what i think was the golden age of bbc television which well never have again
3266294 he knew what the public wanted and he gave the public what they wanted
3266295 he was a wonderful showman and a great believer in his producers and he backed us absolutely to the hilt
3266296 he was an entrepreneur he was a showman and theres not many of his type about any more im afraid we shall miss him terribly i loved him
3266297 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3266298 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3266299 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3266300 there are already drugs that inhibit particular ptks in the late stages of treatment our discovery could change the timing of when and how those or similar drugs are administered
3266301 our studies have shown that ptk pathways are intimately associated with the regulation of checkpoint responses during dna replication
3266302 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication they may lack a key enzyme called tcptp
3266303 recibir la certificaci n ipv6 del departamento de defensa constituye una importante validaci n de la capacidad de red hat para ofrecer soluciones que cumplen con los requisitos m s exigentes

3266305 we will continue our strike if our demands are not fulfilled
3266306 350 tea estates in west bengal that employs about three lakh workers observed shutdown demanding revision of wages the shutdown was successful in the mountainous terai and the dooars belt factories tea gardens and everything else remained closed
3266307 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him
3266308 he sent a personal message asking her to get on board
3266309 she believes he is going to be the first black american president and she is honoured to be a part of that
3266310 simplemente me par en el plato y trat de hacer contacto con la pelota
3266311 hice un buen contacto y la bola se fue uno no llega al plato buscando un jonr n pero se siente muy bien cuando pega uno y ayuda al equipo
3266312 en un juego dif cil y re ido como ste un jugador as es la diferencia entre ganar y perder esta noche ganamos gracias a su actuaci n
3266313 no podemos seguir as en las ltimas entradas de los juegos
3266314 tenemos que hacer algunos ajustes tengo que descubrir lo que tengo y saber qui n est dispuesto a asumir estas funciones
3266315 por m s que no estemos en beijing todo el mundo aqu est muy metido en los juegos hubo m s de 90 000 espectadores en dos d as eso muestra el inter s que hay
3266316 el ambiente es incre ble la gene es fenomenal y hemos recibido mucho apoyo en el estadio
3266317 cuando vine aqu y vi toda esa gente sent que estaba en una olimpiada
3266318 la tuvimos que ver por televisi n lo lament mucho pero as son las cosas
3266319 pero la vida no es justa as que al final no se trata de eso sucedi y parece que mientras m s pronto podamos aceptarlo y procesarlo mejor vamos a estar
3266320 creo que los actos de violencia al azar son actos de violencia al azar parece que no hubo premeditaci n ni nada por el estilo
3266321 parece un caso de estar en el lugar equivocado en el momento equivocado
3266322 it is completely unrecognisable to when we started and is much more complex these days
3266323 new building trends such as stainless steel and marble floors means the technology of cleaning has also completely changed its far more than just emptying bins vacuuming and flicking a duster about
3266324 we approach each of our 120 clients completely open mindedly and tailor our service to their unique needs
3266325 the initial intention to send an official parliament delegation to the conflict site was changed as most of the law makers are on their vacation so we initiated a private trip to south ossetia kyrgyzstan cannot stay aloof being a member of the collective security treaty organization and the shanghai cooperation organization plus kyrgyzstan presides in cis this year three days of the georgian ossetian conflict resulted into thousands of homeless and dead which is a significant threat for the whole cis region
3266326 we should figure out the situation on our own as official moscow and tbilisi represent only their partial interests
3266327 public sale in which articles are sold to the highest bidder
3266328 id received very positive feedback from organisers of the mwa and being a previous winner was advised i was hot favourite to win for a second year running however when i asked the judges for feedback on my novel they told me that it had not been included in the submissions they were asked to judge it was only then that i realised my work was being censored by the muslims writers awards project
3266329 because my creative effort is being treated as if its somehow unclean and unworthy clearly the muslim writers awards has decided that the novel is so unpalatable for them that it needs to be buried
3266330 im deeply dismayed that a project like this which is supposed to unearth new talent and celebrate artistic expression has been hijacked by the puritan mindset yes its true that not all the muslim characters in my book are model citizens however this is just a reflection of the realities we face today
3266331 its unseemly that my novel is being treated as if its the second coming of the satanic verses i have created a work of fiction which is neither blasphemous nor disrespectful towards any particular group or individual
3266332 why dont you feel like you have any control over your life
3266333 la ocupaci n de osetia del sur y de abjazia
3266334 gran parte de la operaci n para obligar a la paz a las autoridades georgianas en osetia del sur
3266335 no s para qu lo hacen quiz creen que podr n utilizarlos como escudos
3266336 sorprende la envergadura del cinismo sorprende el talento de hacer pasar lo blanco por negro y lo negro por blanco al agresor por v ctima de la agresi n
3266337 a sadam husein que pas a cuchillo varias aldeas chi tas hab a que ahorcarlo pero a los actuales gobernantes georgianos que en una hora arrasaron 10 aldeas osetias hay que defenderlos
3266338 seriamente preocupado por el uso desproporcionado de la fuerza por parte de rusia y su falta de respeto de la integridad de georgia
3266339 obese patients may be incorrectly dosed with the use of fixed underdosed or total bodyweight based dosing overdosed when the contribution of pharmacokinetic alterations in obesity are unrecognized
3266340 the honest assessment is that we dont really understand yet whether there is a relationship between obesity and breast cancer outcomes or how strong the relationship is
3266341 the interaction between bmi and breast cancer type was not statistically significant the interaction between bmi and menopausal status was not statistically significant for both overall survival and recurrence free survival
3266342 visually it is not obvious that an interaction between bmi and locally advanced breast cancer subgroups exists furthermore in the multivariable model the interaction term was not statistically significant this may indicate a similar prognostic effect of bmi between the two subgroups
3266343 obesity was not associated with increased risk of recurrence or increased breast cancer mortality
3266344 strong evidence that high bmi and a recent pregnancy were linked to a poorer breast cancer prognosis
3266345 our study suggests that advice on weight loss should be given to all obese patients with breast cancer
3266346 these people hadnt done anything that i hadnt done except to go to japanese language school
3266347 i have to pass this exam or my life will be ruined
3266348 i would really like to pass this exam but if i dont i will have to explore other options like re sits or re doing the year that wont be great so ill do what i can now to try to pass

3266380 we are seeing utter destitution we see malnutrition we are seeing depression we see homelessness people are coming to us from a place of crisis
3266381 there are still a number of people in the community who came out during world youth day there is certainly an expectation that some will decide to seek asylum rather that return
3266382 one of the ideal americans that i have ever known
3266383 call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation hes taking and get him to work

3266389 in june surveyors reported that predatory buyers were bargain hunting for property
3266390 this month surveyors report that realism has returned to the market with many sellers dropping asking prices to more realistic levels
3266391 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species
3266392 going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as sellers start to re evaluate unrealistic asking prices
3266393 it complements our entries into china and the united states giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world our wholesale cash and carry format will bring improved value range and service to thousands of indian businesses
3266394 um hello this describes my fuckin life so much better
3266395 red bull get that foul shit in you itll jack youre ass up
3266396 is that guy holding that lady up by her crotch
3266397 the main concern is the economy and the steep fall in demand
3266398 it seems that the weakness in the us economy has now spread to europe and asia and i think thats what the main concern is
3266399 investors have to realise that if the situation escalates the shutdown in the ports could last a long time and this could start affecting supplies
3266400 i think ive been having contractions since 3 oclock this morning
3266401 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children
3266402 its overwhelming im still staring at her now thinking wow shes ours its actually happened for us
3266403 i hope that if anybody going through treatment sees us and sees evie it gives them one last little bit of hope to go for it
3266404 its been a real emotional rollercoaster theres been ups and downs but you get through it and to have evie now you forget what you went through it makes it all worthwhile
3266405 we were willing to try anything really wed both always wanted children

3266413 the first published study on babies born from vitrification shows no adverse effects of the technique and there are no implications to evies health as a result of the vitrification process
3266414 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare
3266415 in a large employer base it wouldnt be at all unusual to find half a dozen or more people working there who may have a caring role for people with early dementia or a range of situations in the adult area
3266416 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers

3266457 the greatest threat to security in afghanistan and america lies in the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists train and plot attacks and then strike and move back across the border
3266458 we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan pakistan and the nato including necessary assets like satellites and predator drones to secure the border by wiping out terrorist camps and cracking down on cross border insurgents
3266459 hate crime by extremists is met with an agenda of hope

3266490 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3266491 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population

3266519 nevertheless by studying the statistical behaviour of large numbers of microscopic objects we can indirectly infer their quantum nature via experiment and theoretical reasoning

3266527 force india have clearly demonstrated that we have caught up and improved one realises how tough formula one really is and it reinforces the challenge that i have before me for 2009 to be really competitive
3266528 im not only catching up from last season but from the last three seasons and we have caught up even though f1 has become so competitive which is good
3266529 i am quite optimistic however that my experience so far has pointed us in the right direction i now know precisely what im up against so i can plan better
3266530 maybe i learned the hard way but its good to learn so 2009 will be much more competitive for the force india team
3266531 i have two good drivers the experience of giancarlo is invaluable and adrian has lots of talent i think he is improving race by race becoming more consistent

3266535 we realized there was an interest in having university crimes mapped and the information for universities is fairly robust because of something called the clery act
3266536 i think it could be particularly useful for grad students who dont have campus housing and arent familiar with the area
3266537 now that weve automated the system and figured out methodologies its much easier the process is very difficult but weve figured out how to do it
3266538 ultimately were going to go where we can get the data
3266539 there are other systems in place that universities are paying for that are more likely to solve that situation its very difficult to notify everybody in the event of an emergency
3266540 we very much prefer that people call 911 and talk to the police but maybe this becomes another avenue for reporting

3266554 what would the countess say if she knew she had been
3266555 i know i speak for all organizations that have joined this coalition when i say that we are excited and optimistic about the potential to accelerate the advancement of a variety of national geospatial issues
3266556 we intend to begin immediately developing a collaborative advocacy agenda and aggressively pursuing those issues on which we can all agree we invite other geospatial organizations and organizations with an interest in geospatial issues to join us as member or advisory organizations
3266557 we want to reach a 300 mile radius with this vital information

3266560 those zombies kept dropping their eyes into the punch bowl
3266561 i feel that in the uk especially with the dollar being where it is at the moment its pretty difficult to understand the model of building a large scale work for hire studio because then youre competing on price
3266562 yes if youre really high quality people will want you because of that but still the big publishers that commission games are certainly looking at the bottom line and if they can do something for half the price elsewhere theres a pretty good chance they will
3266563 theres absolutely no question being cognizant of the challenges that face us in terms of cost base outsourcing and so on its one of the reasons for keeping ourselves as lean as we possibly can
3266564 but if you look at the flipside of that which is moving towards hollywood
3266565 thats definitely the model were going down and the model we see being positive moving forward and hey is the simpsons cartoon made in korea or is it made in hollywood look at the credits but where is the real creative talent it sits in the us writing it directing the scripts and originally developing the characters i think games are going to go exactly the same way
3266566 my take on the situation is that were the second generation of companies now and i think therell be good successes in this generation realtime have got as good a shot as anybody with a big pile of cash in the bank going for it on the global stage and we all want them absolutely to succeed
3266567 plus i think weve got a great opportunity at the moment with experience and so on so this generation could turn out a mega company it could do but the next generation after this is where dundee will generate a big global player in this sector
3266568 people will make a good amount of money out of this generation thats fine but the next generation reinvesting that cash youve got an opportunity to do something majorly substantial i wont make any daft predictions as to actual size but given how the commercial market has changed as long as youve got the cash to do it its possible
3266569 i really like the combination of analysis behind the news that gamesindustry biz provides it taps into the brains and emotions of so many industry constituencies developers and publishers of course but also manufacturers government and financial players with so much volatility these days its important to be fully advised as well as informed highly recommended

3266575 i am quite impressed by the level and the extent of security that has been in place i think it is still another matter for us to be able to convey it to the full task team
3266576 that would be a challenge because we have personally come to do this visit and it will be upon us to convey that message and raise the confidence of the players that from what we have seen and experienced is the security measures that are in place should be sufficient to have an event that will be safe and secure
3266577 y ou can whet ones appetite but you eat at home
3266578 we put a lot of pressure on them indian middle order we bowled in good areas and we bowled to the plans we set once you had the pressure like that and keep building it then that can make all the difference in the end
3266579 it was critical that the middle order got us runs but none of the batsmen showed consistency and thats what cost us the match

3266590 its envy and jealousy of georgia but its the russian government at fault not the people
3266591 and if you dont stop them and solve the problem it is possible this conflict could lead to the third world war

3266606 if you have multiple kids you may end up with multiple savings
3266607 our family has been more successful at shopping when we go to a variety of stores
3266608 this is one of the most important rules for me kids tend to distract you because they will ask for just about anything they see
3266609 the classic mistake is to load up for fall because kids often decide that what they have is not cool
3266610 if there is a shopping theme for moms its buy less shop more often
3266611 and my girls love the fact that our money goes to helping animals
3266612 make sure the item is sturdy and will last you for a while
3266613 going to thrift and consignment stores and places helping nonprofits is a fantastic way to outfit kids for school
3266614 it surprised me to find a lot of parents are doing this
3266615 a lot of times kids dont know what they want until they take a look at what their peers are wearing
3266616 id wait at least a couple weeks after school starts to buy shoes
3266617 i can usually find a coupon every time i do this

3266626 there have been several offenders in nova scotia who have breached their conditions and weve been alerted by the technology and police have responded
3266627 even though im selling it for 8 000 less than the kelley blue book value ive gotten maybe five calls and all of them were no shows
3266628 im trying to get rid of the trucks i have now but im having a hell of a time doing it
3266629 its anything v 8 the market has just been dead all over town
3266630 a lot of people are staying away from gas hogs if they have a big family theyll buy a minivan instead of a chevrolet suburban or just suck it up and buy a car
3266631 it is purely miles per gallon they ask whats the fuel efficiency
3266632 we get a lot of calls on hondas and toyotas small imports and small domestics as well
3266633 across the board all of them even import suvs like the toyota sequoia and honda pilot
3266634 i get some people that come in to trade down to a smaller car but they have so much negative equity in the suv or truck they have to decide if a trade is worth it or if they should just pay the gas prices
3266635 the toyota prius is still on back order all over arizona
3266636 the truck market is best in places where there is a lot of construction and growth which tucson happens to be they might hold value a little better there but not enough to make a difference
3266637 as soon as we hit 4 a gallon full size sales went down there was an absolute mindset at that number
3266638 we see a lot of trucks and suvs at the auctions but that doesnt mean anyones buying them
3266639 in june compact car prices had a mileage adjusted year over year price gain of 12 7 percent while large pickups and suvs both had annual declines in excess of 25 percent
3266640 even bigger shifts for particular models and powertrain based on fuel efficiency were seen
3266641 i bought a house and needed to get rid of the truck payment its been two months i get an average of one call a week
3266642 with all the promotions and incentives new car dealers are offering now there might not be a better time to buy
3266643 the rosy side is that if you go to the lake and need a truck to pull your boat you can literally save thousands
3266644 even though there is reduced demand someone is still going to want an suv or truck
3266645 oil prices have again sagged lower despite the potential threat that the russia georgia conflict poses to oil supplies the firm us dollar is weighing on the oil price
3266646 i think its going to be a short term issue from the market point of view it will be more interesting to see what happens after the olympics

3266655 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3266656 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3266657 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3266658 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3266659 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on

3266674 the bacteria are the most numerous there are 100 million in every millilitre of saliva and more than 600 different species in the mouth around half of these have yet to be named and we are trying to describe and name the new species
3266675 interestingly this species was isolated from within the oral tissues both in oral cancers and normal healthy tissue this confirms other work showing that oral bacteria can invade both tissues and individual cells
3266676 a detailed description and name for each species of bacteria are needed so that different laboratories can recognise all of the bacterial species present in the mouth
3266677 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the caloric content

3266681 hence the situation that he has been detained does not exist
3266682 seven to eight plainclothes officers who beat me and dragged me and my brother hua huilin into two separate cars
3266683 they asked me why i was going to kuanjie protestant church to worship and threatened me saying you are not allowed to go
3266684 after about four or five hours when i saw that the people who were watching me had all fallen asleep i fled but im afraid to go home
3266685 i havent heard from him weve been waiting here were so worried
3266686 my father asks me every day where he is and i tell him i dont know
3266687 at first we thought it got hit by a car
3266688 this is a really dramatic example of how animals like people can burn
3266689 a common misconception is that animals have fur and its going to protect them
3266690 a lot of animals are found after its too late
3266691 field officers tell me its a grotesque find the molecules that hold the tissues together starts to disintegrate in the sun literally the skin starts sloughing off right in their hands
3266692 tie outs are one of the predominant calls we get
3266693 ende des monats l uft seine option aus da gibt giancarlo pl tzlich wieder gas

3266695 das war schon zu jordan zeiten seine schw che giancarlo l sst sich zu leicht durch schwierigkeiten aus dem konzept bringen
3266696 now i have to sit and wait for the train
3266697 wait one minute when you call someone and they answer the phone arent you supposed to be there since you werent clearly this call is not that important to you yet you still chose to interrupt my evening to make it ill at least give you more courtesy than you gave me by telling you im hanging up now
3266698 oh no i forgot to add the chemicals to the pool
3266699 the good cause threshold you have to meet has gone up
3266700 the prior sheriff had more of a right to carry philosophy some of the things that were considered good cause wont be now
3266701 we dont see the numbers dropping to a few hundred but there will be some who dont apply and some who have their permits denied or revoked
3266702 to persons of good and upstanding character who possess credible significant and substantiated cause to fear for their safety
3266703 will not be issued for political social or other reasons
3266704 a white armoured vehicle was travelling towards kimberley there was another car next to it
3266705 i assumed it was trying to pass and i slowed down
3266706 the armoured vehicle overturned in a cloud of dust i reversed slowly then i saw two men with big guns storming at us
3266707 i wanted to turn around but a red car was blocking the way behind me
3266708 more men with ak 47s jumped out of the red car
3266709 i realised that i could not allow my children to see me become panic stricken i walked to the fence and lay down my mother and children did the same
3266710 then something exploded near us and shots rang out i kept thinking one of us was going to be shot you hear the bullets whistling when it gets quiet you think its over then there are more shots
3266711 i didnt know whether my son was dead my daughter just lay shaking
3266712 in this kind of situation you cant be a hero because you put other lives in danger
3266713 i have found no joy in football since i returned from russia so i would rather not stress about the game anymore i am finished with football even my manager hasnt helped either and nobody wants me anymore in football so i suppose i should say it was nice while it lasted
3266714 if football people arent interested in you anymore why stress i have to accept that this is the reality bad things do happen to good people which is what has happened with me
3266715 the last time that i even trained with a club was when i went to tuks last season but i was unfortunate to limp off with a toe injury during a friendly game against platinum stars
3266716 i dont know why players coming back from europe are not properly utilised so that the country benefits from their experiences how come people like
3266717 i would rather continue playing golf and helping out at my fathers business for now i dont even see myself involved in any other way i dont want to associate myself with things that bring pain to me like the way football has done to me since i returned from russia
3266718 im innocent we were involved in an incident that night but we didnt murder anyone
3266719 im not a murderer but im sure im not the only innocent person in this country to be sent to jail
3266720 of course im dreading whats ahead its not a nice thought but ill take it like a man
3266721 im feel more sorry for my parents my younger brother and my fianc e im not the only one serving a prison sentence indirectly theyre serving the sentence with me
3266722 we de meyer and advocate jaap cilliers sc have identified two or three constitutional points that justify an application for leave to appeal in the constitutional court
3266723 we shall submit the application to the court at the end of this week or next week
3266724 ahh dat doet mijn meisje minstens net zo goed en misschien wel twee stappen beter
3266725 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3266726 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3266727 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3266728 we cant seem to settle ourselves down because people want to unsettle us all the time and its not fair and its not right
3266729 we are trying to build something here and its not going to happen overnight
3266730 we just need time to do it and we will do it ive been in the game 20 odd years and i can deal with most things
3266731 while the top four are running away with the money theyve got that does not mean we cannot play decent football and compete with them on a one to one basis
3266732 there are other things we can aim for like the fa cup and league cup i want to win things and take blackburn into europe
3266733 mark did a fantastic job lets not get away from that the club has gone forward and it is down to me to keep the momentum going
3266734 weve got to be looking at being in the top six weve got to be looking to challenge for europe every year
3266735 weve had a taste of it before and we want it again
3266736 we missed out last season and now it is down to me and my staff and the players to make sure we can achieve that year in year out
3266737 i dont think theres anything that can hurt me any more i can play without fear
3266738 everybody has a dip in confidence and form and circumstances didnt help last year its helped me develop as a player and as a person
3266739 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
3266740 i started writing books with celebrities and other noted people and personalities and i started submitting proposals for books that i really wanted to work on and concentrate on books that would inspire and motivate kids and adults
3266741 and then i saw the emergence of what we call street lit graphic ghetto novels and all of these books that are in my opinion illiterate blather
3266742 i grew up in a time when there were real urban novels its not the subject matter its the quality and the level of the work i dont have a problem with writing about a pimp ive written a book with a pimp but if were going to put out books into the marketplace and they are books by us and by us i mean mostly african american then they should be literate and they werent
3266743 simon amp schuster had the best deal for me which provided me with complete control of my own company i watched what happened to judith regan when she pissed people off they fired her from regan books that cant happen so i wanted to make sure i had control and ownership of my own product and company
3266744 if youre going to do something you should do it right you should do it large and you should do it significantly
3266745 i never wanted to creep into a space and just hang out there i didnt have to do this for a living i was doing pretty well as a collaborator working with some of the biggest names in the industry i could retire on that this is about legacy and this is about reclaiming our voice our history and its about having some control over the images out there
3266746 if youre given a vision to do something you dont do it nine to five it encompasses your entire being its who you are what ive been asked to do is important throughout history the person that controls words is the person that can control and move a whole nation so i understand the value of that and im not taking that lightly its very important that we do it right
3266747 im not interested in taken the route of a bob johnson who started bet which was really geared towards exploitation of a particular community with the hopes of making a lot of money
3266748 to me its about building up a particular community and out of that possibly building up the entire nation and then the world
3266749 for me im looking im searching as a matter of fact were going to have a contest in september i believe in our community theres a j k rowling theres a john grisham theres a stephen king
3266750 i think with the energy that we come to table with there are going to be some dynamic writers out there that im going to look for
3266751 back in the day you had gwendolyn brooks and james baldwin all these folks would hang out and exchange ideas and motivate and catapult each other to success
3266752 today we have a few hacks scrambling over a few dollars trying to be seen and trying to get money i want to make sure we have some great writers coming out of our community we shouldnt have mediocre product out there
3266753 i dont know what the future of black publishing is but the future of karen hunter publishing is unlimited we are in the midst of doing some things that have never been done before and im excited about it
3266754 hosting a successful olympics is now the top priority of the country
3266755 it can be a humiliating thing to sit there and wait in line as a full grown adult so we give it to the kids
3266756 you see these happy faces these kids running out with the kits
3266757 i sent you to find your sister and bring her straight in to dinner not take a leisurely walk in the grounds youve been gone for ages how was i supposed to know where you were what if something had happened to you do you know how long youve been gone
3266758 now molly they are adults and quite capable of looking after themselves
3266759 you could say we got a little side tracked though
3266760 mother our humble apologies for making you worry i am afraid we did not realise the length of time we had taken while locating ginevra
3266761 not like she was in any danger except of making me vomit
3266762 im sorry you were worried we really will be more careful in future
3266763 well go and bring them home soon hermione as soon as we possibly can
3266764 right after ron opened the chamber of secrets and right before we ran into crabbe who tried to burn us alive
3266765 you are hiding quite a bit there potter arent you
3266766 it is going to be fun taking the mickey out of ron something to look forward to
3266767 i dont know why you cant concentrate on embarrassing him for all eternity
3266768 oh yes you go around telling things to open in parseltongue all the time
3266769 you hate talking in parseltongue you never do it unless you have to you avoid snakes harry so yeah sure ron remembers open from five years ago how does he know it what happened to him
3266770 he really did learn it from hearing me do it but no not from five years ago
3266771 i had to open something with parseltongue recently ron was there nothings happened to him ginny hes safe were all safe now hes gone he cant hurt anyone else no one is going to open the chamber again
3266772 he left well it in you the first time he tried to kill you and the second time he used the killing curse on you he ripped it out again and it took the parseltongue with it the parseltongue was part of it
3266773 harry james potter what do you mean he used the killing curse on you
3266774 has anyone checked you over have you been to see poppy are you all right
3266775 see no possible way of mocking harry you dont mock someone whos survived the killing curse twice you just cant do that
3266776 but we can and we should celebrate that with fireworks
3266777 lets go eat mcgonagall can come here later and seal that up some other way ginny
3266778 really im just fine i dont need to go to the hospital wing mrs weasley really mrs weasley mum stop
3266779 harry do you think you can bond with her after dinner
3266780 have you been eating properly you are looking awfully thin
3266781 its not important what you become in life its who you become that matters
3266782 why do i try so hard to act and show something i am not feeling
3266783 we all knew that it would be hard to make changes but i dont think anyone dreamed it would be this hard
3266784 no one looks on you as a savior harry so dont fret about that and dont be surprised if you encounter envy either there are plenty of small and jealous minds in this world kingsley knows that and i think its something you know very well yourself but if you want to keep on making a difference then no one can stop you im sorry if saying this makes you uncomfortable but people do look to you as a leader
3266785 i dont really like it but after what happened last month with with ginny i also know that i cant sit back and think that everything will be fine if i just ignore it ill never make that mistake again
3266786 you know there are some parents who i suppose might be concerned if their daughter was going to marry you but harry molly and i talk almost every day about how happy we are and not just because ginny is so happy we are so proud of what you did and how you did it
3266787 mum cleaned off the wall but i think you should wait until lunchtime before you go back in there
3266788 i was telling harry about the time i scourgified a pot that had about twenty galleons worth of meat and vegetables in it that she had spent five hours preparing fortunately it was after we were married otherwise i think she might have cancelled the wedding
3266789 daddy when did you ever have twenty galleons to spend on food
3266790 i was worried about having christmas without fred but its so peaceful to be home and its so special to be here with you
3266791 its like having a dog theyll eat anything and constantly
3266792 actually ill make two and everyone else can share the second one
3266793 thats a shame it would have been our first real break
3266794 turquoise is involved with what happened to the inn not just with the turntongue
3266795 and ill bet it also means that the death eaters are holed up with her or at least some of them are
3266796 one thing that i dont understand is why was she just standing there looking at the inn
3266797 she was imperiused didnt the auror say they detected two spells one of them an imperio the other one was your body binder
3266798 if youre saying that she was acting against her will then i never saw it all those times when she was in the inn using crescerio on the turntongue she was not imperiused
3266799 i think she wasnt imperiused when she was looking at the inn
3266800 she reacted pretty quickly when she saw us and ran i dont think the curse happened until she was over the fence and in the lane
3266801 when we saw her we had just gone upstairs and i think she would have heard us going up the steps and that would have scared her off
3266802 we know a few more things but we have more questions that mate is an indication that we are on the right track lesson sixteen in the training manual
3266803 they knew you had nicked those parchments sagittaria told me the next day
3266804 yeah i got reamed out by stoney and then even worse by percy
3266805 mercander stone hes my mentor everyone gets a mentor he works with you and you get to go out on cases with him stoneys pretty cool he knows how to chew you out though
3266806 i guess i deserved it i did point out that it demonstrated some holes in their security but they claimed that there was no security on that stuff in the first place
3266807 so i guess were sleeping up here and the girls are sleeping where
3266808 take a run around the house in your skivvies every evening or without them that ought to cool your ardor
3266809 you can be sure that hes been planning this for months probably ever since you had that lunch with shacklebolt last fall percy picks up on things like that its called having your finger to the wind he saw that kingsley wanted you in the program so he set up all the parchments and forms ahead of time just in case you decided to sign up that way it looks like percy is the model of efficiency which he is and can read the ministers mind to boot
3266810 yeah but how did he know that i would sign up hell i didnt know
3266811 it wasnt hard to predict mate we all knew that you werent happy adding up columns in that ledger book of yours
3266812 i paid a lot of gold for that ledger and your own brother george spent a lot of time showing me how to do it right
3266813 really thats brilliant i hope george will be running it ill get to see him all the time will he
3266814 he was looking out the back door toward freds grave and he started crying he wouldnt talk to anyone he just went upstairs and locked his door
3266815 why did bill take her up does he think george will talk to her but not to me
3266816 my guess is that fleur wont say a word bill knows how to talk to him its hard to be gloomy when shes in the room though
3266817 lets not be like this its christmas were all here we do have something to be sad about but we also have things to be happy about the world is a much better place than it was a year ago
3266818 but he wants to be alone for now he said hell be down for dinner
3266819 it tastes like apricots and peaches and theres honey in it too isnt there
3266820 ah maman if i tell you ze recipe zere will be no mystery it is a mystery punch
3266821 brilliant we stashed one in the broom cupboard just in case and i found the tutu you used two years ago all we have to do is paint it
3266822 thats what i felt like doing were engaged so whats your problem
3266823 blimey i cant wait to see what theyre like after theyre married
3266824 theyre likely to starve to death with all the snogging
3266825 careful you may have to run around the house in your knickers with ron
3266826 if i agree to do that will you give me five minutes no ten minutes alone in your room
3266827 well then lets get married now then we wont be breaking the rule
3266828 we has come to the burrow as you requested master harry the inn is secure the auror goldberg seems to know what he is doing may we be of service
3266829 take that cake those mugs and that cauldron of cider into the parlor well be right along
3266830 i forgot to tell your mum about the house elves
3266831 im in my home with my family and with you and everythings perfect
3266832 i felt like i was with you today even when i wasnt
3266833 somehow nothing seems to separate us when i first started living in the inn i felt lonely whenever you werent there now you are there always im never alone anymore
3266834 did anyone ever tell you that love would be like this
3266835 i see my mum and dad do things where one knows what the other one is thinking but thats not what im feeling is that what youre feeling
3266836 no its way more than that i know what its like to be you not actual thoughts but feelings and and
3266837 yes thats what it is and like you said love im never alone anymore
3266838 a sweater from mum as usual an autographed cannons quaffle from bill and fleur a photo of me and hermione from ginny i think thats for both of us a dragon hide wallet with three magically hidden compartments from charlie a grooming kit from aunt muriel i guess thats a hint of some kind a necktie and cufflinks from percy i guess thats a hint too a foe glass from george hmm i wonder if thats a hint and a years gift certificate from hermione to an all you can eat restaurant in chelsea god i love that woman
3266839 how do they look they go perfectly with my ring
3266840 i dont remember it of course i wouldnt have remembered anything while you were doing that
3266841 dennis had a camera probably colins old one do you like it
3266842 ill put it on my night stand so i can fall asleep looking at it thanks love
3266843 its a gold chain necklace ginny said he likes that kind of thing didnt you
3266844 you can blame me if he doesnt but hell like it
3266845 harry you have the best ideas this is adorable ill put it up in the parlor it will go very nicely there
3266846 how does he know what winky wants most for christmas
3266847 i want you to be my house elf at the inn and at grimmauld place but you have done very brave and very dangerous things for me and also for the black family its your reward it means that you can do whatever you want and if you want to stay with me then i will be very happy
3266848 he deserves to be free the poor creature has gone through so much
3266849 youre not going to ask him to do something are you
3266850 i am and now he can say no if he doesnt want to do it
3266851 harry hes old and tired you cant do that it will kill him we had no choice then and and everything was at stake this is completely different
3266852 when we were hiding in grimmauld place last year we needed to find mundungus fletcher he had stolen the locket the one siriuss brother regulus took from the cave dung didnt know it was a horcrux kreacher told us that he could find him he brought him back to grimmauld place and thats how we traced it to umbridge now harry wants to use kreacher to find turquoise southeby right
3266853 thats why i gave him clothes i mean i wanted to free him anyway but he doesnt have to go find her if he doesnt want to
3266854 hell do whatever you want even if it isnt good for him if shes hiding with death eaters they wont hesitate to kill him
3266855 it it seemed like a good idea we have to find her the fidelius this is the only way well find out who tried to kill me
3266856 and ginny i could have hurt her worse than i did or even even worse
3266857 harry hermione is right you shouldnt ask kreacher to do that it could be really dangerous and hes getting so old youve mentioned it yourself
3266858 hermione hell be fine hes already changed his mind he knows it wasnt right
3266859 how do you know he changed his mind he didnt say anything
3266860 do you remember that night after freds funeral when we walked down to the grave and the moon came up
3266861 it was a bad night all i could think of were the people who had died hedwig and dobby too i was lying right here in this bed and it didnt seem like there was any place in the world for me i had no home no family i never had a room like this with neat stuff from my childhood i had nothing
3266862 then you came and got me and we went to the grave you cried but you told me it was because you were crazy for me those were the words crazy
3266863 i knew at that moment that my life would be with you and now i think that i always knew it maybe we were never alone but we didnt know it
3266864 it was a good idea kreacher should be free not winky though she would probably start drinking again she needs structure in her life
3266865 i thought i was doing something to protect both of us not just you
3266866 we do need to find them we wont be safe until we do
3266867 i did something stupid and youre agreeing with me thats no help
3266868 you didnt do anything stupid you might have but your friends kept you from actually doing it freeing kreacher was beautiful just like hermione said and kreacher knew it too
3266869 i wont ask him to go look for southeby hes free he can do whatever he wants

3266905 he was at the pinnacle of success and legendary status he was such a beautiful and fun guy and loved and appreciated by so many he will truly be missed and i watched him at bedtime almost nightly
3266906 he got on my tour bus once in front of the trump hotel in new york and talked to myself and a group about the injustices of the world of tv concerning his show but that he intended to stand firmly in his principles concerning the creative aspects of his script

3266910 it was so sad to hear about isaac hayes so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best god bless
3266911 i last saw isaac a while back in washington d c at a concert where we were both performing although he was under the weather he was still performing he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls god bless his family
3266912 three time grammy winner isaac hayes was a true renaissance man singer songwriter producer session musician actor activist and more his groundbreaking theme song and score for the movie shaft cemented his status as a musical icon the world has lost a true creative genius and a passionate humanitarian but his indelible legacy will remain ever present our deepest sympathies go out to his family friends and all who were inspired by the man and his music
3266913 isaac hayes was a multi talented artist whose body of work had a tremendous influence on the music of the last 40 years in the 1960s and early 1970s he was a songwriter producer pianist and vocalist for stax records and he played a crucial role in the development of memphis soul music among his many accomplishments he helped write such classic hits as soul man hold on im coming and b a b y he was a truly talented artist and he will be sorely missed
3266914 isaac hayes exemplified all that is stax we are all very fortunate to have worked with a visionary who changed music in indelible and profound ways his talent was matched only by his kindness of spirit on behalf of the entire concord stax family we express our deep sympathies to his family friends and fans all over the world
3266915 i am shocked we have lost not only an incredible talent but a wonderful leader to his community and a dear friend to me there will only be one isaac hayes gifting us with years of performing writing and a voice that penetrated deep into our souls he is to be admired for changing his life around and standing steadfast to his beliefs his integrity and to helping others isaac you will be missed but never forgotten

3266919 im convinced that the students who attend these institutions of higher learning are the scholars the exceptional the leaders of the future they possess the courage and talent to set the standard for the next generation of leadership for our country
3266920 it was a lot i cant count but it was cool i guess
3266921 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3266922 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3266923 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3266924 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3266925 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
3266926 because thats just who he was im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
3266927 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3266928 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3266929 i have not filed the lawsuit proceedings for the money it is more about the respect and principle of the matter

3267065 some conservative think tanks are saying interference that projected sea level rise and temperatures are decreased from the tar third assessment report in 2001 i know its a matter of more confidence and less extremes but can you explain in laymans terms why this is not a decrease in your projections through 2100
3267066 well as i think i said theyre broadly comparable but theyre actually hard to compare i think a fair statement would be that looking at the error analysis that we were able to do here because of the availability of so many models now we were able to much more comprehensively analyze the uncertainties so the statistics really and in doing that from the point of view of um certain parameters that allows a decrease in the uncertainty in the estimate when you dont have a lot of models you might have to um be a little bit less well rigor well rigorous is not the right word i apologize its a matter of you might have to be ah concerned about how far you would go without quantitative information i think thats what i really would like to say
3267067 dr solomon youve taken a clearly objective neutral scientific line in your presentation of the data could i ask you now to perhaps sum up what kind of urgency this report should convey to policy makers what should be done now
3267068 i can only give you something thats going to disappoint you sir and that is that its my personal scientific approach to say that its not my role to try to communicate what should be done i believe that is a societal choice i believe science is one input to that choice and i also believe science can best serve society by refraining from going beyond its expertise so i do not feel that it would be in the best interests of society making this decision in the most responsible way for me to push for urgency or action there are people out there who have that role but it isnt me and in my view its what ipcc also is all about namely not trying to make policy prescriptive statements but policy relevant statements

3267150 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3267151 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3267152 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash

3267246 bahut bura laga bahut afsos huwa i felt really bad i was very sorry when they decided to ban my film
3267247 i had done extensive research for the movie and had consulted mughal and rajput manuscripts various historians said jodhaa was called by different names like harkha bai and bhanumati but when i met members of the jaipur royal family they said the name jodhaa was the most popular among them hence i decided to stick to it
3267248 the deleted scenes were cut with a heavy heart no matter how big a hit my movie was the deleted scenes were really special they have their own mahatwa importance

3267253 ideally we would have liked to release the home video of the movie before the satellite premiere of the film but now we will be releasing it 10 15 days after it airs on television the value of the home video definitely comes down after the satellite premiere but it is difficult to say at this point in time whether it will affect sales or not however our strategy is to promote the home video release of the film during the tv airing
3267254 jodhaa akbar home video is a collectors item and we believe that the first airing on television is not going to affect its home video sales its a product that people will want to own and keep
3267255 the home video has a lot of special features and we wanted to make sure that we give out the right product with the right quality hence the delay however the product has a life of its own and we believe that people will want to own it
3267256 its a product that people will want to own and keep

3267264 i tried to get inside his head against him and it worked
3267265 he would have been able to beat me but he kind of made mistakes hes got to work hard and give 100 percent theres no other way to do it
3267266 as far as him being in the shadow of rulon he was
3267267 but as far as im concerned hes the best guy in the world at his weight if he wants to win this tournament hes going to win this tournament its about him believing he can

3267270 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3267271 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3267272 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3267273 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3267274 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3267285 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent

3267292 no i dont like manny to fight oscar de la hoya
3267293 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3267294 as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are
3267295 of course if we feel the rule has been breached we will invoke it
3267296 we will not turn a blind eye to issues of a serious nature
3267297 it is quite a complex matter and cant just make a judgement on the spot but clearly we have a club owner who has not yet been found guilty of any offence

3267302 women are the caretakers of traditions and are responsible to instill proper values and virtues in our children
3267303 they are also responsible to maintain traditional customs farm the taro for food
3267304 in palauan culture there are also exceptional times when the matrilineal system may find a void of leadership or period when the responsibility of women may require them to take a more active role

3267320 i hate to take a cheap shot here but if this really is the kind of strategic thinking that was going on behind the scenes for the hillary campaign i think we have a real explanation for why they lost
3267321 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humour would come from
3267322 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards

3267324 in june surveyors reported that predatory buyers were bargain hunting for property
3267325 this month surveyors report that realism has returned to the market with many sellers dropping asking prices to more realistic levels
3267326 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species
3267327 going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as sellers start to re evaluate unrealistic asking prices

3267347 we feel like our team overall has been held back by our defense
3267348 we got hit in the mouth and acted like someone took our lunch money
3267349 the kids get a majority of the credit because theyve really taken ownership of what we want to do defensively
3267350 the first thing we addressed in fall camp was if you want to be put in the category of great teams then you have to consistently play good defense
3267351 energy excitement and passion that has rubbed off on our players
3267352 weve got a great defensive coordinator he changed the whole mentality of the defense its just what we needed
3267353 a clear mind means fast legs and a cloudy mind means slow legs

3267362 there also some downward pressure on commodity prices today which is adding extra weight on the australian dollar and commodity prices are adjusting down because the growth estimates for the global economy have also been revised down
3267363 so the two are going in tandem and thats weighing on the australian dollar
3267364 tensions are very high and were worried about the ethnic dimension and our fear is if tensions run higher it could lead to a very dramatic situation over the short term and have lasting consequences for the country
3267365 all of a sudden just before theres a potential announcement theyre raising last minute issues which quite frankly have been addressed have been discussed and we now have support not only from the australian workers union but certainly public sentiment is behind us on this issue

3267370 the acdp has serious concerns regarding both the desirability and constitutionality of these bills the national prosecuting authority amendment bill and the south african police service amendment bill
3267371 however should the majority party persist with the bills we undertake to play a constructive role in the deliberations as well as in the criminal justice review mindful that a crime weary population is looking to us as leaders for solutions to organised crime and crime in general that is threatening the very foundation of our state

3267373 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3267374 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up the sting
3267375 he acknowledged that he came over based on the text messages that were sent to him to have sex with a 15 and 17 year old girl
3267376 het lijkt erop dat een inspanning wordt ondernomen de fatsoenlijk gekozen regering van rusland af te zetten
3267377 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3267378 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3267379 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt

3267381 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3267382 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3267383 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3267384 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3267385 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3267386 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3267387 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3267388 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3267389 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3267406 i dont know who avweeks multiple sources are or if this is pure speculation but we are not commenting on internal boeing deliberations about tankers
3267407 i cant imagine that we wouldnt go back to the air force and the department of defense and say you have to redo this you have to give them a fair opportunity even if it takes another six months they have to have an opportunity for a fair competition

3267423 deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3267424 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3267425 we hope russia will join the broad consensus that is emerging that this has gone on for too long
3267426 implications for the region implications for the future relations of russia with the united states and the other international communities
3267427 for us the situation is not as simple as our american colleagues or our georgian colleagues would like us or others to see
3267428 our forces are continuing to take steps which would make sure that georgian forces do not have the ability to invade south ossetia again
3267429 all the georgians have left we lost it to russia

3267451 following the latest developments the impression should not emerge that georgia is now excluded for an unlimited period from nato membership

3267457 ive always wanted to stage this particular production of pagliacci the setting is coney island on the day of the mermaid parade and id always conceived it to be staged inside a tent so it would be like a circus tent
3267458 when i staged things in new york the singers that were literally on my doorstep were phenomenal and everybody wants to work
3267459 i tried high and low to find someone who was not from too long a distance to cast i put notice out in edmonton and no one wanted to join the production so that was a real bummer
3267460 he was originally going to be an ensemble member because he sings but hes not very experienced on the operatic stage at all and it was a huge risk but i couldnt find a silvio

3267462 we have reports that six people were killed it was near badaber

3267469 some poor people see playing the lottery as their best opportunity for improving their financial situations albeit wrongly so
3267470 the hope of getting out of poverty encourages people to continue to buy tickets even though their chances of stumbling upon a life changing windfall are nearly impossibly slim and buying lottery tickets in fact exacerbates the very poverty that purchasers are hoping to escape

3267512 without fully employing its abilities even at the final moment the imperial nation is surrendering before the enemies propaganda

3267515 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation

3267518 i think he felt he was defending a womans integrity
3267519 you know it was very interesting because at first i am not happy about the way the chinese are treating the tibetans because i dont think anyone should be unkind to anyone else and so i have been very concerned about how to think and what to do about that because i dont like that
3267520 then i have been concerned about oh how shall we deal with the olympics because they are not being nice to the dalai lama who is a good friend of mine
3267521 and then this earthquake and all this stuff happened and i thought is that karma when youre not nice that the bad things happen to you

3267534 unabashedly spiritual before it was admitted in polite company that progressives could be spiritual
3267535 she was hanging on for dear life from then on
3267536 in the theater of pain dona was an accomplished actress
3267537 when dona was born i thought she was the cutest little baby
3267538 she loved animals the kittens the dogs the puppies that we had over the years someone once traced our family tree all the way back to mayor dick whittington of london who had a cat it might benefit anyone in their quest for political office to go to the animal shelter and pick up a cat or a dog
3267539 but most of all she loved the city of berkeley with its climate of free speech and the political activism
3267540 i was proud of her five successful campaigns for the district 4 city council seat she once took a controversial political stand for which she received a death threat but i think she was right
3267541 it didnt matter to her what power it was we all knew how courageous she was when dona started fighting for the i 80 bridge i thought it would never happen but she doggedly pursued it until one day i was present at the groundbreaking
3267542 for the past 27 years i have had the great privilege to be donas companion and primary caregiver but in recent years it would not have been possible without a team of caregivers
3267543 dona did not want the public to know of her pain she was becoming increasingly quadriplegic but could still remember names and faces to an uncanny detail she would tell me could you call so and so and tell them such and such at this number even if she hadnt met the person in 10 years she loved life to the fullest and although she had many fears she refused to let any of those stop her of course she was not perfect no saint is
3267544 dona dreamt big but also dealt with the day to day stuff
3267545 she probably had more requests for neighborhood services than any other councilmember in the city whether it was traffic disputes or taking care of services for the elderly and the disabled today we finally have a site for the citys animal shelter because of her

3267548 you should allow 30 to 45 minutes if you just want to visit rembrandts home a visit to the house the museums collection of rembrandt prints and the temporary exhibition will take you about an hour

3267552 when we look at more localized studies and reporting we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers
3267553 kaminsky said at this weeks black hat briefings in las vegas that the flaw not only allows hackers to force people to visit web sites they didnt want to but it also permits them to intercept e mail messages
3267554 although the email aspect of the flaw implies a man in the middle attack the flaw goes much deeper than that since it involves the central computers that route internet users to relevant ip addressed systems
3267555 the problem with the internet is that although its structure appears logical and relatively simple the reality is that there is some quite complex routing involved and as the internet grows so that complexity
3267556 the world of ip addressing and url security is advancing at a rate never before seen in the it industry this means that a secure solution developed just 12 months ago is not going to be totally secure today it managers need to constantly review their security systems and software to be sure that they protect their it resources as effectively as possible
3267557 collabnet facilitated chcfs efforts and will support all future code donations to oht we are providing a world class development platform and online community services to enable ohts members and distributed project teams to collaborate in an open and secure environment
3267558 the collabnet platform is a perfect fit for the vision of a global health information exchange system where health organisations anywhere in the world are able to collaborate share code and jointly develop software and new technology standards
3267559 open health tools is taking an important step towards expanding the use of open source in the health care market
3267560 the acquisition of colubris networks will strengthen procurves hardware management platform and services significantly improving the overall performance capabilities of both wired and wireless networks and will deliver even more best in class choices for our customers worldwide
3267561 with our vision and continued support from hp leadership i am convinced that procurves impressive growth and market leadership is unlimited
3267562 we recognize that theres a need to properly monitor individuals who are on parole in the federal system
3267563 literally every moment of the day a persons location can be verified
3267564 its incumbent upon the government to clearly set out the criteria for inclusion within the program
3267565 we believe we can do this without violating the rights of a violent offender
3267566 this is the first government i have seen in my life as a canadian since 1968 that has politicized the correctional system
3267567 you mean that air over there is worse than this air over here
3267568 i just need five minutes in my house i need to go to my house
3267569 one would think from this kind of incident youd have more
3267570 this asbestos and how close we were and how much asbestos is on our lawn and around the house
3267571 we didnt know where to go because we were shaking
3267572 i think generally canadians are perceived as a little more cautious and tend to follow trends rather than charging out in front
3267573 in the united states and in europe there are many companies using this model of distributed work in canada it has yet to emerge
3267574 all of those stars are beginning to align which i think is providing a lot of motivation for organizations to get serious
3267575 whats very interesting is its not just the price of the gas but the total cost of the commute that i think has now become apparent
3267576 a good part of it has to do with a total lack of support and promotion by our governments especially at the federal level
3267577 they recognize the many benefits and advantages and strongly support it
3267578 here we dont use the carrot and we dont use the stick theres not even a donkey
3267579 we have engineers we have psychologists we have lawyers we have many professional people who just like distributed workers dont need full time access to an office
3267580 we needed to know that we could grow because our business was growing we were entering the u s market and we werent sure if we were going to need four people or 40 people if you grow to 40 people you need 40 desks and 40 laptops and 40 of everything
3267581 suiteworks already had a system in place to accommodate our staff regardless of how big it grew so for us i tell them were adding three more people and 48 hours later im ready to go
3267582 calgary is the perfect location for us because there is such a premium on downtown space from a cost point of view but also there simply isnt anything available
3267583 its horrible they brutalized her they absolutely brutalized her there is nothing a seven year old girl can do to deserve what they did
3267584 i knew the little girl i knew her mom and i know the two charged very well thats the hardest part
3267585 its like shes not even there her head is just flopping around like a doll her eyes are just up in space
3267586 its their job to approve a facility the city does not do that
3267587 some parts of toronto this would be permitted some it would not be
3267588 the safety of propane storage is especially significant to the city of toronto because resident and working population densities are so high that any level of hazard is one that could affect hundreds of persons in a single incident
3267589 it may be assumed that as redevelopment in the city continues and as the automotive propane distribution networks grow this fundamental conflict will intensify
3267590 the city wouldnt be in a position to know whether a facility has followed up with the province and achieved its licence
3267591 he wouldnt have lasted another night in the field it is touch and go from day to day with him we are here to feed him to groom him to clean him and to treat him but it is up to the horse whether or not he wants to live
3267592 he was obviously starving because there was no grind left in his teeth which meant he was unable to eat the grass
3267593 our volunteers could not have been prepared for the shocking sight that met them when they eventually found the horse soaked through wandering aimless on bog land he is a walking skeleton quite literally
3267594 we have been astounded by this old boys determination to live and are doing our utmost to make sure he has the best chance of recovery he has a lovely deep warm clean bed and gets small warm mashes fed to him every two hours morning and night to gradually re acquaint his body to food
3267595 i am sure mickey marley would turn in his grave to know his once doted on horse and companion was left to die in such a heartless way

3267599 we have reports that six people were killed it was near badaber
3267600 about 18 paf pakistan air force employees were traveling to the base when the bomb planted on the bridge went off
3267601 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come
3267602 on the face of it the government has made great strides they the tigers are really hemmed in this time
3267603 im just not sure the military progress can be translated into political progress
3267604 my wife is on edge from the moment i leave home until the moment i return
3267605 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators
3267606 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now
3267607 the worry is that what seems like a passing phase might become a way of life
3267608 peace cannot be kept by force it can only be achieved by understanding
3267609 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3267610 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties
3267611 federal police are scaling up their capacities in the fight against kidnappings with an unprecedented effort
3267612 were proposing a pact a national agreement that sets certain rules and commitments from each of the people involved
3267613 on the contrary the fight against organised crime has been reducing the financial and operative capacity
3267614 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
3267615 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and not clothed the world in arms is not spending money alone it is spending the sweat of laborers the genius of its scientists the hopes of its children this is not a way of life at all in any true sense under the cloud of threatening war it is humanity hanging from an iron cross
3267616 we have imposed curfew to ensure the peaceful burial of sheikh aziz
3267617 how difficult it is to be palestinian and how difficult it is for a palestinian to be a writer or a poet how can he achieve literary freedom in such slavish conditions and how can he preserve the literariness of literature in such brutal times
3267618 a land on the brink of dawn let us not quarrel about the number of those whove died here they lie together furnishing the grass for us that we should be reconciled
3267619 were open for business but no one is coming to pitch

3267623 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose russias duly elected government
3267624 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3267625 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world
3267626 we found a three to fourfold higher overall prevalence of cerebral microbleeds compared to other studies
3267627 we also found that the risk factors for cerebral microbleeds appear to vary according to the location of the microbleed
3267628 our results show people with high blood pressure and a history of smoking had microbleeds in a different location in the brain than people with the apoe e4 allele suggesting different causes for microbleeds in different locations

3267630 youll never be able to do that you just cant dont even try
3267631 well i know its bad but can you blame me
3267632 sex plays a tremendous role in maintaining the mechanicalness of life
3267633 you must try to understand what i mean mechanicalness is especially dangerous when people try to explain it by something else and not by what it really is when sex is clearly conscious of itself and does not cover itself up by anything else it is not the mechanicalness about which i am speaking on the contrary sex which exists by itself and is not dependent on anything else is already a great achievement but the evil lies in this constant self deception
3267634 what then is the deduction should it be so or should it be changed
3267635 whatever they may be speaking about they ask ought it to be like that and how can it be changed that is what ought to be done in such a case
3267636 new birth of which we have spoken before depends as much upon sex energy as do physical birth and the propagation of species
3267637 hydrogen si 12 is the hydrogen which represents the final product of the transformation of food in the human organism this is the matter with which sex works and which sex manufactures it is seed or fruit
3267638 hydrogen si 12 can pass into do of the next octave with the help of an additional shock
3267639 this is the normal and natural way to use the energy of si 12
3267640 the transition of matter si 12 into emanations and the gradual saturation of the whole organism by
3267641 completed transmutation that is to say the formation of the astral body is possible only in a healthy normally functioning organism in a sick or a perverted or a crippled organism no transmutation is possible
3267642 is complete sexual abstinence necessary for transmutation and is sexual abstinence in general useful for work on oneself
3267643 here there is not one but a number of questions said g
3267644 then the other question is sexual abstinence useful for the work or not
3267645 it is useful if there is abstinence in all centers if there is abstinence in one center and full liberty of imagination in the others then there could be nothing worse and still more abstinence can be useful if a man knows what to do with the energy which he saves in this way if he does not know what to do with it nothing whatever can be gained by abstinence
3267646 speaking in general what is the most correct form of life in this connection from the point of view of the work
3267647 speaking in general there are only two correct ways of expending sexual energy normal sexual life and transmutation all inventions in this sphere are very dangerous people have tried abstinence from times beyond memory sometimes very rarely it has led to something but in most cases what is called abstinence is simply exchanging normal sensations for abnormal because the abnormal are more easily hidden but it is not about this that i wish to speak you must understand where lies the chief evil and what makes for slavery it is not in sex itself but in the abuse of sex but what the abuse of sex means is again misunderstood people usually take this to be either excess or perversion but these are comparatively innocent forms of abuse of sex and it is necessary to know the human machine very well in order to grasp what abuse of sex in the real meaning of these words is it means the wrong work of centers in relation to sex that is the action of the sex center through other centers and the action of other centers through the sex center or to be still more precise the functioning of the sex center with energy borrowed from other centers and the functioning of other centers with energy borrowed from the sex center
3267648 but this is only one aspect of it another aspect consists in the fact that when the energy of the sex center is plundered by the other centers and spent on useless work it has nothing left for itself and has to steal the energy of other centers which is much lower and coarser than its own
3267649 what must be done to struggle against the abuse of sex
3267650 but you already ought to understand that it is just as impossible to explain to a man who has not yet begun to work on himself and does not know the structure of the machine what the abuse of sex means as it is to say what must be done to avoid these abuses
3267651 toch zouden we niet tot afgelasting hebben besloten zegt jeannette takkebos namens de organiserende stichting buitengoed

3267653 het is ook duidelijk te merken dat ondernemers met name buiten de stad moeite hebben met het vinden van personeel vooral in het segment van lager betaalde banen die banen worden nu vaak ingevuld door oost europeanen
3267654 we moeten dat cijfer wel vasthouden en dat wordt in de toekomst moeilijker je ziet nu al dat bedrijven de stad verlaten inmiddels staat 27 procent van de kantoorpanden leeg dat zijn allemaal banen die naar andere plaatsen zijn verdwenen
3267655 maar een grotere hoeveelheid forensen komt iedere dag de stad in daarom moet veel worden ge nvesteerd in bereikbaarheid anders zoeken bedrijven een andere plek op en dat is jammer want de centrale ligging van woerden maakt het voor veel bedrijven een ideale vestigingsplaats
3267656 de bedrijvigheid in woerden is groot geworden doordat er in de stad utrecht eigenlijk te weinig ruimte was

3267720 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3267721 no changes or cuts to the film will be made

3267725 it is not our policy to reduce the level of award to a victim of rape due to alcohol consumption

3267756 in 40 days muslims were martyred in jammu their houses burnt but the hindu fanatics were not harmed the occupation forces of india are communal they have become addicted to spilling the blood of kashmiris

3267765 i always knew what i was getting into i always wanted to play well defined roles bachna ae haseeno is my first out and out romantic film and i feel its a novel concept i have got to play a very cute girl next door character
3267766 no filmmakers of hollywood are willing to sign any bollywood actor without a screen test apart from aishwarya they seem to know no hindi film actors not even amitabh bachchan

3267777 lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness
3267778 do not use objects and gifts as routes to affection the child will learn to associate love with items and thus trust in the material love rather than the principle of love flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart

3267782 im sorry for i apologize for i realize that hurt you because will you please forgive me
3267783 and that cost us the series the middle order not getting the runs proved critical our batting was never consistent even in galle where we were 170 for no loss and should have made 400 and we cant lose five wickets in 40 overs and that has happened a few times
3267784 it is not sachin and sourav alone it is important for everyone to contribute the middle and lower order let us down to start against two spinners is not easy and it was important for batsmen who got starts to carry on
3267785 it was not easy to pick runs when mendis and murali are bowling together the pressure they created made it tough mendis is no mystery but it was great effort to pick 26 wickets
3267786 it is too early to say anything there are teething problems with technology it is not a 100 per cent and thats for sure
3267787 we will then start picking what to go to for the tv umpire
3267788 we will have to see whether ball tracking is 100 per cent and if it picks height and distance and whether it can be judged on television i am sure people will sit down and discuss the problems
3267789 we need to see how we can get runs it was not a great series for our batsmen we have a month and a half for the next series against australia and that gives us lot of time to think
3267790 the bowlers poured their hearts out and it was tough on them
3267791 and getting third in the 200 free four years ago you know when i do lose in a race like that and in circumstances like that it motivates me even more to try and swim faster
3267792 i think over the past four years ive been able to make some pretty significant drops in the 200 free
3267793 i couldnt ask for anything else so far from my first three medal races
3267794 weve done everything that ive wanted to do so far
3267795 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history and the olympics have been around for so many years is a pretty amazing accomplishment
3267796 its definitely an honour ive been able to spend some time with carl lewis and exchange a few words with spitz here and there so its pretty amazing
3267797 just about every morning i have woken up at about 4 30 or 5 oclock it takes me a while to fall back to sleep and when i do fall back i get an extra half an hour
3267798 it takes me a while to get up in the morning but its the olympics so you have to
3267799 eleven dead bodies and 11 injured have now been brought here
3267800 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge
3267801 it is a jihad because this individual should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity
3267802 if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction
3267803 after banning triple decker beds some schools are trying to find ways of getting around it we have reports that in some schools two pupils sleep in one bed
3267804 schools should excuse us we are going to start biting if we have been barking now we shall bite
3267805 the finance ministry has given us sh3 5b for the exercise of this sh1b will remain at the headquarters and sh2 5b disbursed to the districts

3267807 whatever is done from love always occurs beyond good and evil
3267808 in the end one loves ones desire and not what is desired
3267809 the best friend will probably acquire the best wife because a good marriage is founded on the talent for friendship
3267810 heaven is not a place its just an idea but its a very strong idea because if we didnt have it we wouldnt have any hope

3267812 he who does not know how to put his thoughts on ice ought not to enter into the heat of battle
3267813 if we live together with another person too closely what happens is similar to when we repeatedly handle a good engraving with our bare hands one day all we have left is a piece of dirty paper the soul of a human being too can finally become tattered by being handled continually and that is how it finally appears to us we never see the beauty of its original design again
3267814 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
3267815 the main concern is the economy and the steep fall in demand
3267816 it seems that the weakness in the us economy has now spread to europe and asia and i think thats what the main concern is
3267817 the health ministry is intensifying control activities which include the elimination of vectors and treating the victims twice a year

3267820 i award death sentence to both convicts under section 302 of the indian penal code both convicts shall be hanged till death
3267821 if the facts are seen closely it would be found that the gravity of the present case is more than the case before the supreme court in our case the victim was of such an age that she should have been seen by the convicts as a motherly figure committing rape of an old lady shows a mind which is more depraved than dhananjoy chatterjees
3267822 gen musharraf is standing alone today due to our political strategy and we have succeeded in conveying our message to the international community that stability in pakistan can only be possible through real democracy and not through dictatorship
3267823 our party is a federal party and also the largest party in the country so it has greater responsibility to save the federation
3267824 i had conveyed a message to general musharraf two months ago to quit but he didnt consider it and now he stands isolated
3267825 every one knows about the current situation of the country which is even worse than 1971 and 1988 leaders like zulifkar ali bhutto and benazir bhutto were there at that time to guide the nation and now the party is trying to overcome the crises in line with the thoughts and ideology of its great shaheed leaders
3267826 i am well aware that the nation is facing issues like high inflation and unemployment the poor masses have expectations from us and we will live up to their expectations we will bring positive changes in the lives of the poor as promised by mohtarma benazir bhutto shaheed
3267827 i am not required to accept or reject a resignation our constitution says that once somebody resigns that position becomes vacant
3267828 we have fully functioning organs of our party which operate transparently and effectively on all issues that arise and we treat contradictions as a routine matter
3267829 since this matter came up we have had meetings of the national executive committee to consider their grievances the national steering committee also met the buganda caucus on saturday and decided to have wider meetings with the district chairpersons in the buganda districts
3267830 thats why for the baganda to clamour for kiggundus replacement is uncalled for all these offices are going to be refilled
3267831 i was elected on october 26 2005 for a term of five years if i am nominated again i will be available
3267832 we have acquired and made available to railways 4750 acres land for various projects in bihar there is no substance in lalus charges
3267833 this is the reason i described lalu as an accomplished liar and even thrown goebbel behind him in the art of lying
3267834 with india we will build on the close partnership developed over the past decade as two of the worlds great multi ethnic democracies the us and india are natural strategic allies and we must work together to advance our common interests and to combat the common threats
3267835 we believe it is in the united states interest that all of these emerging powers and others assume a greater stake in promoting international peace and respect for human rights including through their more constructive participation in key global institutions
3267836 we are committed to us engagement in asia this begins with maintaining strong relationships with allies like japan australia south korea thailand and the philippines and deepening our ties to vital democratic partners like india in order to create a stable and prosperous asia
3267837 we must also forge a more effective framework in asia that goes beyond bilateral agreements occasional summits and ad hoc diplomatic arrangements we need an open and inclusive infrastructure with the countries in asia that can promote stability prosperity and human rights and help confront transnational threats
3267838 it is a strategy that recognises that we have interests not just in baghdad but in kandahar and karachi in beijing berlin brasilia and bamako it is a strategy that contends with the many disparate forces shaping this century including the fundamentalist challenge to freedom the emergence of new powers like china india russia and a united europe
3267839 we need a global response to climate change that includes binding and enforceable commitments to reducing emissions especially for those that pollute the most the us china india the european union and russia

3267845 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3267846 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3267847 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3267848 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3267849 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3267850 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3267851 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3267852 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3267853 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3267854 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses

3267857 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3267858 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3267859 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3267860 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3267861 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes
3267862 standing on the sidelines you just go i dont know if i would have the same toughness
3267863 even though many clinic patients dont have insurance we have pulled together community partnerships to make sure they get everything insured women would get
3267864 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag
3267865 every morning it was raised and reminded me of what a great nation i come from i hope this flag also brings you and your class the joy and contentment it has brought me
3267866 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
3267867 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today

3267869 the yatra to the amarnath shrine has been suspended today no batch was sent from jammu to the cave shrine
3267870 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3267871 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3267872 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3267873 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3267874 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3267875 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3267878 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3267879 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3267880 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010

3267882 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct
3267883 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3267884 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3267885 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3267886 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3267887 ive been doing an album with lil wayne its called t wayne the project its basically just going to be an array of things just a visual love the two artists youve seen collaborate with everyone except each other when you see us together its crazy right now we already have what weve done were gonna keep going till they tell us to stop we might even put out a mixtape weve got so many songs that we just might do a t wayne mixtape too
3267888 the white people who just want to heal and move on what a luxury
3267889 i moved because i have black children and i need them to be in a place where the prevalent images arent of thug life and thug culture
3267890 i know there are people who want to fix the problems
3267891 we investigate these crimes and sometimes they are as they appear
3267892 obviously we have had a high profile murder in that neighborhood in recent history so the department is aware

3267896 i never imagined the torpor of the nations leaders and people
3267897 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3267898 the sacrifice of so many people who died in the war would go unrequited if this purpose remains unfulfilled

3267937 like coach was saying theyre a mountain of men it seems like theyre all 6 5 and above 315 and they can move theyve got stars at every position
3267938 the schedule we had it seemed like we were short on time we wound up short on numbers we got our butts kicked the whole week but a lot of our guys were just hanging on
3267939 i think well be more ready for that this time plus itll be good being here and not in 100 degree heat down there
3267940 but were not going to arm wrestle them were going to play football there are different philosophies in how to succeed in this game its a chess match
3267941 but nobody can say they have the absolute assurance that theyll get it
3267942 at this level everybody is so prepared physically and the level of gymnastics is so high but it comes down a lot of times to your nerves
3267943 i dont think we will see the same situation in the team finals
3267944 everyones going to have mistakes but for us it was important to get them out of the way
3267945 we dont want to have those same mistakes in finals
3267946 i think we will have a very good fight with the chinese on three up three count
3267947 she physically is unscathed but having to deal with this incident has been hard for her shes shown incredible strength and over the last couple of days weve been able to talk our way through it

3267949 i used that energy to say to myself im not going to fall off this horse no matter what the team needs me lets prove to them that im clutch when it comes to these types of situations
3267950 he did what he had to do knew what he had to do i thought he was coming off at least twice in that routine but he worked it somehow and stayed on that thing amazing
3267951 the guys never gave up we knew the heart and spirit of our team and that all the hard work would pay off
3267952 to be thrown into this team so quick thats what makes it so good for these guys to accept me
3267953 im horrible at math it was my worst subject in school
3267954 ive definitely never celebrated that much after a race in my life
3267955 i wanted to sing on the medal stand but i couldnt stop crying
3267956 just everything that has happened in the last year and hearing the stars and stripes and everyone watching back home i was so emotional and i have no idea why
3267957 once i get to the competition its like im in a cage so just let me out
3267958 if theres any guy i thought could win a gold medal here harry lester was the guy
3267959 for jake to upset him says so much because harry lester is the real deal
3267960 theres always been something inside me i dont know what it is saying i dont want to tread the path everybody else has
3267961 i want to make a name for myself starting my career off by making this team really was a great way to do that
3267962 steve prefontaine was a young athlete who set for his age group world records
3267963 that was motivating to me to see he had that attitude even at a young age that he could compete with the best
3267964 we always encourage all of our juniors to come out
3267965 we have other juniors who do that but nobody as dedicated as him and as much he literally won a state championship and like the next day he flew to colorado springs to train
3267966 im not a kid that just wants to get some tattoos
3267967 i told my parents when i was 15 i wanted one they said you make your first world team you can get a tattoo i was 17 made a junior world team got my tattoo then they said the only way you can get another one is when you make an olympic team sure enough i surprised them and made one a few months later now im getting another one
3267968 ive found that college football moves a lot faster than high school i was too hesitant today ive got a lot to learn but im willing
3267969 its great that weve got eight running backs with great post sports columnist woody paige fields your questions look for woodys mailbag every thursday qualities im a power back slasher but that no 43 has incredible speed
3267970 im never quite close enough to being satisfied we did some good things but we can do them better
3267971 i thought he completed a lot more than 4 of 23 passes
3267972 clearly on that one scott busted in the middle of the season hes going to take that one in
3267973 weve got a lot of guys who can get the job done
3267974 and the holes close up quicker a couple of times i didnt know what to do so i just ran forward as hard as i could i always want to fall forward if i dont i lost that run
3267975 the target looks to be about the size of a grapefruit from that distance
3267976 i buried a 10 i knew it was a 10 as soon as i let the arrow go and i knew it greatly increased my chances for a gold medal
3267977 theres nothing easy about winning a gold medal in the olympic games
3267978 but theres as much pressure at the trials just to get to the olympics it demands total focus
3267979 in 1992 i just didnt have the same confidence as i did in 1988
3267980 i was more interested in little league baseball but archery was fun for me
3267981 i always was the smallest kid in my class so i played sports where i could compete
3267982 we had to go 8 miles to catch our school bus and sometimes we had to use snowmobiles to get there
3267983 i was 17 and hadnt shot since i was 12
3267984 i dug an old bow out of a closet and i went to a tournament and did pretty well
3267985 i had put a great deal of focus into the collegiate nationals
3267986 if i had asked myself after that if i thought i could make an olympic team my response probably would have been no
3267987 you dont have to be 6 foot 8 and weigh 240 pounds you dont have to be
3267988 archery is such a cool sport its a sport you can do all your life

3267992 its been a very very difficult decision to make im hoping to have something here in the next couple of weeks make my final decision and go forward with it
3267993 i will say i dont want this to linger too much longer i should make my final decision pretty soon whatever that is i want to make sure its 100 percent sure
3267994 when i talked to francois in june we both understood that the team was going to go forward regardless of what my decision was going to be and that enabled me to take as much time as i could
3267995 right now i know training camps approaching rapidly summers gone by pretty fast im going to make my decision here pretty shortly
3267996 at the end of the year i didnt know if i was going to come back i needed that time to really think about my future it was a tougher decision than i thought it was going to be at the end of the year its all about whether i feel im ready to go another year thats the biggest thing for me am i prepared to do what it takes to be successful for another year
3267997 that the older you get the more you have to put in know what it wouldnt be fair if you just showed up to the rink and say ok im ready to play and not put in the time off the ice it wouldnt be fair for yourself it wouldnt be fair for the organization it wouldnt be fair for anybody if youre not ready to do the things you need to do to be the best that you can be
3267998 i have to be honest with my body and myself and know that if i come back i want to come back and help the team and help the team be successful
3267999 if i cant be that player then i dont think it would be fair to the team or myself to play

3268027 the third goal last night was one we havent used before it was one we knew we could use against a team that was trying to charge me down and get out there quite quick
3268028 it was the one we wanted to get out early in the tournament that will probably stop teams or make them think about how fast they run out they cant over commit to me because weve got all these other options
3268029 its something like between 15 and 20 so weve got lots of options that we can use at penalty corner time
3268030 theyre all very simple just little changes really weve got different variations that we can use against each team which is probably why we have got so many
3268031 what i love about it is if i put a good flick and it goes where i want it to go and the keeper saves it then ive done my part
3268032 im not that worried about youve got to give your opposition a bit of credit they might get lucky sometimes
3268033 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later

3268134 she sort of came into my mind and would not let go of me
3268135 this truly is my natural state the natural rhythm i fall into
3268136 i like the quiet the opportunity to focus without the distractions of the day
3268137 its a choice based upon the fact im a much better person when i dont drink
3268138 it would be a more interesting environment in which to observe me and about which to write my winnipeg existence is a much narrower experience
3268139 you get the impression andrew is creating defensive positions around certain things and people that he feels he may have to defend
3268140 if anything i write to entertain myself i want to create situations that compel me to keep writing to find out what happens next and if i do maybe the reader will have that feeling too
3268141 not having a sack of bad poetry hanging around theres always more words coming better words
3268142 there was stuff in my manuscript that didnt belong that somewhere in there was the novel i wanted it to become
3268143 i thought the agent who represents fforde is someone id be interested in being represented by
3268144 it would be an egregious lapse of judgment for you to represent me allow me to outline 10 reasons why
3268145 there are hundreds of literary agents in toronto and new york and my assumption is if one says i kinda like this but no thanks you simply try the next one and so on
3268146 at that point my through line became whatever doesnt drive the plot forward gets taken out
3268147 in this case here was a gimmick backed by a degree of execution and intelligence that was very attractive
3268148 extremely confident id be published somewhere eric was this kind of gate and if you could walk through that door you knew you had a very good chance of entering a new world
3268149 some books just feel right right from the get go this was one of them

3268152 theres nothing shy about andrews writing he grabs the reader by the lapel and just doesnt pull him close he slams his face down on the burning hot element of an electric stove as actually happens on page four of the gargoyle then having unleashed these pyrotechnics he proceeds to tell an engrossing story its one thing to have chops and another to have something to say and still another to have a yarn to spin really i think hes a writer of limitless cleverness
3268153 im obviously very pleased that my novel will be read by a number of people and hopefully theyll enjoy it and find some value in it
3268154 but writing for me never was a destination that was going to be arrived at when i got published

3268207 the whole conflict is not being waged over the pipeline the reasons are definitely geopolitical
3268208 however the russians know the pipeline is important to georgia and may try to damage it they have the capability to do so
3268209 this shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets
3268210 for europeans an alternative supply route is psychological reassurance its having a route that does not go through russia
3268211 but the other countries the pipeline passes through may ultimately prove more unreliable
3268212 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke

3268261 every nonviolent movement has as its first obstacle the problem of overcoming fear the otpor kids were brave they expected to be arrested but they prepared for arrest with all sorts of publicity stunts and by training their activists how to behave when interrogated by recruiting lawyers to help by building solidarity they calculated that their arrests combined with their use of humor and ridicule if sustained long enough would persuade ordinary people to overcome their fear

3268359 i am human and i need to be loved just like everyone else does
3268360 i find this all very depressing i dont want to have even a tangential relationship to a system that has so cheapened the word i think its impossible right now to participate in literary life to publish even in publications that i find sympathetic to take advantage of those persons or institutions that are open to me to develop the literary and poetic community that until now has interested me this is not a heroic pose of publicity stunt it is not an attempt to improve my publishing prospects this is a specific necessary limit that im putting on myself i am convinced that my texts are nothing more or less than the contemporary poetic mainstream and that if the mainstream represented by me adopt such a half underground and as far as possible independent positions then maybe there will be more honest uncompromising and genuinely contemporary art in my country

3268373 look what my mom and dad got me for international youth day billy an ecoman micro bullet rc helicopter its just like the one the real ecoman flies only smaller and real really real
3268374 but wait theres only one ecoman how are we going to decide who gets to play ecoman itd be a shame to leave one of these awesome copters on the sidelines instead of zooming up to 50 feet above the ground
3268375 well maybe we could recreate ecoman versus america from all hero stories 31 may 1943
3268376 oh right the one where hitler creates his own ecoman robot or maybe march of the ecomen when ecoman recruited the boys of ecotropolis to form the ecoman corps
3268377 yeah from ecoman family 17 november 1958 or maybe a pigeon cries in ecotropolis from the ecoman amp black ecoman special winter 1975 you could play the african american sidekick as we bust up that drug house full of nuclear waste
3268378 and theres always beholdeth a dark one riseth from the astonishing ecoman 138 through 144 april october 1979 the saga of dark ecoman
3268379 well no way am i painting my copter purple and setting it on fire id rather play teenage ecobotomy where the new nitrous huffing gay club kid ecoman has to kill off the earlier incarnations of ecoman in his subconscious ill never forget ecoman 1 march 2002
3268380 boy that grant morrison is really something hey you know what the internet says there are like and this helicopter doesnt have anything to do with any of them near as i can tell so really we could play whatever we want
3268381 good i was running out of comics tropes to make fun of
3268382 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3268383 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3268384 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3268385 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3268386 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on

3268388 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3268389 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3268390 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u s out we cant wait to see how china japan and
3268391 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3268392 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3268393 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious

3268411 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3268412 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3268413 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3268414 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3268415 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3268416 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3268417 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3268418 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3268419 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3268420 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3268421 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3268422 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3268423 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3268424 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3268425 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3268426 sono tranquillo e concentrato per me come per tanti altri tra le partite pi importanti della carriera siamo pronti e vogliosi di poter far bene in questa gara
3268427 a volte limportanza della partita va ben oltre a quelle che sono le condizioni fisiche di una squadra in ogni caso abbiamo lavorato duro per essere pronti e lo siamo
3268428 ho avuto dei piccoli problemi dovuti alla preparazione ma ora sto bene non ho problemi fisici sto bene
3268429 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3268430 the war in iraq is even less popular in oregon than it is nationally
3268431 there is less resource extraction fewer farms and tree fellers and more high tech workers
3268432 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3268433 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3268434 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3268435 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3268436 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3268437 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3268438 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3268439 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3268440 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3268441 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3268442 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3268443 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3268444 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3268445 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3268446 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3268447 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3268448 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3268449 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3268450 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3268451 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3268452 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3268453 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3268454 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3268455 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3268456 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3268457 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3268458 it doesnt matter if iraq had weapons of mass destruction saddam was a cruel and ruthless dictator who oppressed and murdered his people
3268459 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3268460 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3268461 it is our choices harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities
3268462 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3268463 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3268464 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3268465 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3268466 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3268467 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3268468 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3268469 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3268470 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3268471 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3268472 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3268473 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3268474 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3268475 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3268476 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3268477 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3268478 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3268479 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3268480 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3268481 the wall street journal gets a gigantic miss for taking at face value the recent actions of moqtada al sadr rather than a surrender i think his recent actions are the start of hezbollah south with strong support from iran the real nature of transformation will become apparent once the united states troops are withdrawn
3268482 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
3268483 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3268484 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
3268485 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
3268486 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
3268487 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
3268488 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
3268489 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day
3268490 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3268491 barry and his 300 advisors are no match for putin hed spin the junior senator like a top and play him like a fiddle
3268492 barack obama while on vacation still managed to handle the crisis between russia and georgia better than trigger happy mccain john mccain was ready to wage war with russia because he thought that they attacked atlanta if he had any soldiers in his army after his brilliant surge in iraq he could send them to fight russia
3268493 it took the race card to defeat the clintons and they resent the hell out of it
3268494 hillary fought a tough battle made mistakes that cost the nomination
3268495 it was written well before he went into politics and it was not ghost written
3268496 why are people still arguing about hillary and obama this entire election will boil down to one factor race like bob kerrey said if obama was a tall skinny white guy named paul jones the election is a different story
3268497 is there anything obama can learn from this story and these memos
3268498 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters
3268499 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3268500 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3268501 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3268502 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3268503 anyone whos paid attention knows that obama makes many more gaffes than mccain
3268504 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3268505 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3268506 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3268507 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3268508 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3268509 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3268510 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3268511 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3268512 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3268513 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3268514 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3268515 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3268516 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3268517 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3268518 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3268519 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3268520 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3268521 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3268522 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3268523 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3268524 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3268525 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3268526 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3268527 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3268528 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3268529 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3268530 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3268531 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3268532 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3268533 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3268534 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3268535 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3268536 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3268537 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3268538 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3268539 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3268540 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3268541 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3268542 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3268543 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3268544 just so you all know we did set a record
3268545 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3268546 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3268547 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3268548 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3268549 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3268550 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3268551 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3268552 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3268553 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3268554 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3268555 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3268556 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3268557 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3268558 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3268559 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
3268560 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
3268561 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
3268562 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3268563 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3268564 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3268565 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3268566 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3268567 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3268568 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3268569 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3268570 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3268571 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3268572 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3268573 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3268574 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3268575 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3268576 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3268577 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3268578 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3268579 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3268580 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3268581 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3268582 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3268583 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3268584 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3268585 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3268586 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3268587 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3268588 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3268589 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3268590 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3268591 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3268592 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3268593 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3268594 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3268595 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3268596 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3268597 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3268598 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3268599 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3268600 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3268601 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3268602 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3268603 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3268604 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3268605 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3268606 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3268607 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3268608 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3268609 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3268610 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3268611 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3268612 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3268613 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3268614 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3268615 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3268616 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3268617 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3268618 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3268619 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3268620 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3268621 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3268622 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3268623 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3268624 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3268625 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3268626 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
3268627 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3268628 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3268629 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3268630 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3268631 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presence that draws you in
3268632 al gore is one of the few public figures challenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
3268633 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3268634 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3268635 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3268636 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3268637 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3268638 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3268639 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3268640 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3268641 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3268642 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3268643 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3268644 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3268645 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3268646 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
3268647 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
3268648 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
3268649 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
3268650 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
3268651 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3268652 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3268653 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3268654 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3268655 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3268656 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
3268657 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
3268658 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3268659 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3268660 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3268661 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3268662 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3268663 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3268664 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3268665 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3268666 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3268667 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3268668 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3268669 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3268670 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3268671 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3268672 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3268673 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3268674 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3268675 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3268676 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3268677 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3268678 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3268679 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3268680 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3268681 how about north and south under the federal republic of cyprus
3268682 as the federation of caucasian associations we stress that south ossetia and abkhazia are not breakaway regions they are independent republics their invasion by georgia cannot be accepted just as no invasion in the world can decisions of independence by the people of these countries cannot be rendered null and void through wars south ossetia is currently under invasion by georgia babies are heartlessly being killed there and innocent mothers fathers and the elderly are being lynched
3268683 we want turkey and the rest of the world to recognize these two countries independence as they did for kosovo we call on international democracy and human rights organizations to call for an end to the barbarity in south ossetia
3268684 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3268685 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3268686 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3268687 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3268688 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3268689 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3268690 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3268691 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3268692 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3268693 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3268694 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3268695 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3268696 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3268697 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3268698 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3268699 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3268700 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3268701 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3268702 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3268703 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3268704 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3268705 cannot build the cars any faster than right now in the united states
3268706 you need to be sociable and speak to your stepmom cus she has done alot for you ect
3268707 it was a waste of money cus i see no difference
3268708 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3268709 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3268710 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3268711 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions

3268717 this is not about one or two institutions we are now working with the other players in the industry
3268718 our investigations focus is shifting to the next group of market participants
3268719 any resolution would need to address the same concerns addressed in the
3268720 we think the banks are eager to resolve the matter
3268721 i made the conversion to opendns when i found that our isp had not patched a critical security flaw in their dns servers
3268722 opendns was never vulnerable to the security flaw and offers many other services that make running a 21st century health care data network easier
3268723 by using opendns as our dns server it allows a second check on all web traffic coming into our schools
3268724 opendns has assisted in stopping unwanted internet traffic from making it to our students computers
3268725 for example i hear so many guys using the terms tailor made and custom made interchangeably when theyre totally different
3268726 many guys can tell the difference between designers and wholesale brands or between high and low thread count in fabric but theyre baffled when it comes to the finer distinctions like the difference between custom suits and tailored suits thats where we can help
3268727 it comes down to the fact that if youve got two weeks or more then ordering a tailor made suit online and getting it handmade for your exact measurements by skilled tailors all for under 300 is really hard to beat
3268728 while savoring the sights sounds smells and tastes of barcelonas mediterranean beachfront

3268732 our technology gives us the ability to look at data holistically we can look at clients performance standards and identify the high potentials then see what we can learn and leverage from that we also analyze their high performing employees in specific positions to develop competency models that guide recruiting succession and development
3268733 peak performance means different things to people the important thing is to understand what it means for your organization
3268734 theres a line between being responsible for rebuilding a country you helped destroy and being a chump and i think we crossed that line
3268735 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3268736 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3268737 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3268738 do i keep with my payment plan which should take 5 or so years to pay off
3268739 there are many myths about international marriages but no one knows what percentage of the marriages actually end in divorce and how many unions survive and thrive this survey should put our minds at peace
3268740 i was sick and tired of coming home and feeling sick and tired
3268741 i knew i had to do something about it but i didnt know how to support my family financially while spending more time on my music and less time at work
3268742 i decided that i was going to start off small and work my way towards my goal of being my own boss
3268743 i joined the heavy metal band because there was nothing else in my neighborhood at the time if i had the option then i would have chosen hip hop if you listen to my hip hop beats you will notice they have a rock and roll edge to them i think that makes them unique
3268744 it took me weeks to figure out how to upload tracks on the various sites i was lost
3268745 i am very grateful to have a supportive family because i worked for most of the day which was very unfair to my wife i guess she understood that i was trying to do something that would benefit our family in the long run shes awesome
3268746 i started to make money and that made me want to work harder
3268747 i did not know anything about computers or internet marketing but i was selling something on the internet
3268748 i received an email from carlos and he expressed that he liked my beats and he wanted to propose a business venture to me the business venture included my own website a large marketing budget company branding and his know how i was skeptical at first but i decided to take a chance the rest is history
3268749 mark was very talented but i knew that i could help him with his marketing the first thing i noticed was the fact that he did not have his own website the beat marketplaces are a good way to make a couple sales here and there but there lots of noise on those pages that take the potential customers attention away from his product the first thing we did was build mark a site and promote his company brand bos beats
3268750 in order to make loyal customers we have given our customers many advantages when they think of purchasing a beat they come to us because we give them more for their money in this day and age of high gas prices and inflation thats all everyone is looking for more for their money thats what the site is built around
3268751 what can i say other than you cant beat bos beats the material is radio quality beats at affordable prices i feel like i have timberland type beats for a fraction of the cost i buy one beat and i get three mark has also given me feedback that has helped improve my skills as a rapper my sister sings and she also buys her beats from bos beats hes the truth man
3268752 im so happy things happened the way they did everything happens for a reason now i can spend time doing what i like make enough money doing it and help the artists improve
3268753 world art vision is a chance for individual artists to exhibit their most recent work but it is also an opportunity to meet with the other artists present and attend the exciting program of collateral events and conferences which are being organized and of course to meet with the public visitors collectors and critics
3268754 this is a marvellous opportunity for artists to meet with each other with the public and potential buyers cancun being a resort with extremely high level tourism and trade and we are extremely grateful for the encouragement and for the support given by the ayuntamiento benito juarez cancun and the state of quintana roo in the organisation of this event
3268755 getting used to our blessings is one of the most important nonevil generators of human evil tragedy and suffering
3268756 life could be vastly improved if we could count our blessings as self actualizing people can and do and if we could retain their constant sense of good fortune and gratitude for it
3268757 the purchase of lavon internet represents a significant step toward achieving our goal of creating the largest wisp in the dfw market

3268791 this was a strategic acquisition in a dynamic market extra space is the 3rd property ebs has acquired in texas this month we expect to close on four more assets in texas prior to the end of september the texas economy is rapidly expanding and we are well poised to benefit from the growth
3268792 this is a great economic stabilization project in a great area
3268793 we have a lot of confidence in austin and believe that we will quickly bring this facility to a stabilized maximum economic occupancy and realize explosive growth in value over the next 24 months
3268794 ebs has by far the best property management team and the best property management systems in the self storage industry
3268795 the lending market has become much tighter and lenders are much more selective about both projects and sponsors
3268796 we think that by using the effishowers in the hotels the hotel managers will be part of a mass education program
3268797 it shows the guests that is possible and easy to use a lot less water during the shower
3268798 we hope that after using an effishower in the hotel room environmentally conscious people will use the effishower for their own shower
3268799 as far as we are concerned every bank or stock brokerage firm involved in the auction rate securities fraud is little more than a pitiful lying cockroach of a company you call your institutions you are nothing more than thieves that deceived 150 000 unsuspecting us citizens out of what in many cases was their life savings pay up or we start getting specific
3268800 there has been so much lying and deception involving auction rate securities that we cannot believe people are not going to jail as an example on friday august 8 2008 a commentator on cnbc described auction rate securities victims as rich people
3268801 this was a pathetic lie one only need see who advertises on cnbc in order to gain insight into this perspective
3268802 most of the 2000 individuals we have talked to in the last five plus months have been senior citizens or working class people who trusted a lying stock broker or a bank investment adviser with the words just like cash safe liquid etc
3268803 americas watchdog expects the vrdn market place aka municipals to collapse because of the erosion of city county or state tax revenues if a consumer has these types of investments they may not be safe
3268804 americas watchdog expects more us bank failures and a further us real estate market devaluation in 2009 of at least 10 in states like california it could be 20 this valuation erosion has far reaching implications that will put at risk the entire economy any us bank that has exposure to pay option adjustable rate mortgages or large portfolios of second mortgages is cooked if the second mortgage was originated before 2007 chances are its now worthless
3268805 if us consumers have wall street type investments it may be a great time to park your money in a federally insured account auction rate securities are just the beginning its going to get much worse much riskier and many us consumers will lose it all
3268806 gosh thats what we think wall street investment bankers stock brokers banks and mortgage bankers have been doing to us consumers and now as it turns out the us taxpayer since 2003
3268807 non violent drug offenses are being over prosecuted and corporate crime is being under prosecuted
3268808 the justice department must begin to reverse course crank up the crackdown on corporate crime and end the cruel and inhumane war on non violent drug possession
3268809 the criminal justice system is broken so badly that one hardly knows where to begin describing the breakdown
3268810 lets start with the war on drugs since commentators across the political spectrum recognize its lunacy we pour almost endless resources roughly 50 billion every year into catching trying and incarcerating people who primarily harm themselves this insane war on drugs damages communities and drains crucial resources from the police courts and prisons these resources could be better used to combat serious street and corporate crime that directly violates the publics liberty health safety trust and financial well being as with alcoholics and nicotine addicts the approach to drug addicts should be rehabilitation not incarceration
3268811 the current drug policy has consumed tens of billions of dollars and wrecked countless lives
3268812 the costs of this policy include the increasing breakdown of families and neighborhoods endangerment of children widespread violation of civil liberties escalating rates of incarceration political corruption and the imposition of united states policy abroad in practice the drug war disproportionately targets people of color and people who are poverty stricken coercive measures have not reduced drug use but they have clogged our criminal justice system with non violent offenders it is time to explore alternative approaches and to end this costly war
3268813 probably would not have gone on to have the career you have had
3268814 it is urgent that the u s reverse the incarceration binge the u s department of justice estimates that if incarceration rates remain unchanged an estimated one of every 20 americans and greater than one in four african americans can be expected to serve time in prison during their lifetime
3268815 it is time to make the failed war on drugs a central issue in the american political dialogue for too long we have let this injustice continue to grow unhindered taking action on clemency at the federal level will set an example for the states and begin the process of reversing this failed policy
3268816 the current cruel unjust policy perpetuated and enforced by the bush administration prevents americans who suffer from debilitating illnesses from experiencing the relief of medicinal cannabis
3268817 while substantial scientific and anecdotal evidence exists to validate marijuanas usefulness in treating disease a deluge of rhetoric from washington claims that marijuana has no medicinal value
3268818 in need of alternative crops and aware of the growing market for industrial hemp particularly for bio composite products such as automobile parts farmers in the united states are forced to watch from the sidelines while canadian french and chinese farmers grow the crop and american manufacturers import it from them
3268819 there now is a significant and growing backlog of criminal investigations and unresolved matters
3268820 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to us residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3268821 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation

3268828 im gonna tell you how my day was just shut up and listen i went to my shitty job at a call center and my supervisor threatened to fire me if i showed up late one more time then i went to the subway station but the subways were not running i hadnt eaten at this point so i tried to buy something at the cheapest place i knew but the prices had gone up so much that i couldnt afford anything then i had to take the bus but it was so full of people because the subways were not working that someone took my cell phone from my backpack i arrived at my university five minutes late with the paper i had to complete but the professor was not there that day so i basically spent all night writing an essay that i wont have to submit until next week then i went to his office because i needed the scores of some exams but it turned out that theyd lost my file after this i went to my second class and a piece of ceiling fell on my head not to mention that it was so freezing inside that building that i had to keep my woolen gloves on and i couldnt write and that was it
3268829 after all we threw this party for you you could at least show some gratitude

3268845 mr samuel has for years been seeking to criminalise cartel conduct
3268846 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3268847 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3268848 that we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3268849 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3268850 i have an incredible amount of vintage that ive collected over the years
3268851 my style is very americana i gravitate to pieces that are american by nature either western or depression era
3268852 i do almost everything in jeans except sleep denim has become so high priced as of late my friends back home dont want to spend 250 for a pair of jeans i want them to be able to walk into a medium priced store and be able to afford a cool pair of jeans for less than 100 bucks dollars
3268853 my mother simply doesnt want to live any more in this situation
3268854 she feels she has lost her second chance at life and her extradition doesnt permit her to imagine herself in the future
3268855 this is a story that i know well because i had to leave italy because of these events
3268856 also because i had friends who were extremely close to slipping into terrorism like you slip into drug use
3268857 the courts have never established the full truth about what happened even though many of the terrorists are free or have never spent a day in jail for the public this is intolerable
3268858 pressure is a privilege lessons ive learned from life and the battle of the sexes
3268859 that match taught me a lot dealing with the media and the attention and pressure and what it stood for the symbolism of the womens movement
3268860 its a fun read it will take you an hour and half its quick
3268861 besides chapters on pressure is a privilege and champions adjust i talk about integrity and my heroes that were important in my childhood like my teachers rev bob richards and alice marble

3268870 medically unexplained symptoms can be related to any body system and most medical specialties
3268871 more than a quarter of primary care patients in england have unexplained chronic pain irritable bowel syndrome or chronic fatigue
3268872 and around a third of new neurological outpatients have symptoms thought by neurologists to be not at all or only somewhat explained by disease
3268873 in many these symptoms can be made worse by worries about school friendships or family
3268874 patients can have relatively severe diseases such as heart attacks yet adapt well and refuse to give up their work thus they have disease with little illness
3268875 i dont wanna go to the international museum of milfoil art
3268876 there would be workplaces where it would be possible to offer more hands on types of support along the lines of those workplaces that currently offer work based childcare
3268877 in a large employer base it wouldnt be at all unusual to find half a dozen or more people working there who may have a caring role for people with early dementia or a range of situations in the adult area
3268878 we do face an ageing society creative approaches are going to be required and on a voluntary basis the sort of model the actu floated may warrant being examined by some employers

3268883 the sacrifice of so many people who died in the war would go unrequited if this purpose remains unfulfilled
3268884 been issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer
3268885 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3268886 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3268887 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3268888 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3268889 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007

3268954 whats happening to the dollar has to do with a shift in relative growth and interest rate expectations
3268955 the currencies that have come under the most pressure especially over the last three or four days have been those where until recently inflation concerns dominated and now the slowdown in the global economy has generated a shift lower in interest rate expectations
3268956 the current price rises arent driven by strong demand so will be a drag on corporate and household activity its a negative for japans economy
3268957 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies in the second half of the year
3268958 the overwhelming majority of republican senators have pledged to protect october 1 as american energy freedom day so we can reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower the cost of gas at the pump
3268959 many people arent aware that the bans on drilling must be renewed every year and all we have to do is allow these prohibitions to expire on october 1 in just 50 days americans will have the freedom to pursue their own energy resources here at home our letter is very straightforward we will actively oppose any effort to extend the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale
3268960 theres been a great response already but frankly every senator should sign on because its irrational to say
3268961 i encourage all of my colleagues republicans and democrats to stand with americans who are hurting from high gas prices and sign this letter as a first step to increasing american energy supplies

3268968 for many people organic agriculture and food biotechnology is an either or proposition and in actuality all of these food processes produce foods that are healthy and of benefit
3268969 this project has been a chance for many of us to discover how amazingly true barack obamas concept of how we are the people we need is at this fiercely urgent moment at our generations now as our country and world has endured huge struggles and missteps in our recent history this dedicated group of supporters has climbed onto the platform obama has constructed to unify us all and are taking the message to heart by teaming up and using our strengths to leap toward solutions that make a difference to citizens now

3268977 we felt that limiting the survey to just one group wasnt going to give us the whole picture
3268978 these results showed us that enterprise risk management has become a huge challenge for those charged with managing a companys financial health with many looking for guidance on the next steps they should take
3268979 the common theme in the two surveys suggests the need for more collaboration between finance audit committees and caes

3268986 my colleague and i have just used our fourth a final 30 minute session on the faulkes north and south robotic telescopes we began in october 2005 due to all their problems and despite making 22 bookings most of which had to be recredited due to telescope faults in particular the poor quality new ccd cameras it has taken us almost three years to use up these four sessions out of the 22 sessions only 7 did not take place due to the weather to begin with in july 2005 the facility was excellent but once the ccd cameras were changed it was all down hill even now things are not so good as they once were there has been management changes but it has not help much i think schools in the uk have just about given them up
3268987 my impression so far with gras is very encouraging and i look forward to a an exciting relationship which i hope will develop over the years thank you
3268988 please feel free to use this email on your site as you see fit
3268989 here is my comment i dont have any problem if you need to use my name please correct any orthographic and or grammatical fault
3268990 thanks to let us enjoy of this unique opportunity to use professional astrophotography equipment i am a beginner in this world and i know how difficult it is to get pictures from the night sky with gras i have been able to get high quality pictures with only a pair of mouse clicks
3268991 i live in albuquerque nm about 100 miles from incredible dark skies and have been doing ap since 1996 as a hobby but this means moving many hundreds of pounds of equipment to those skies and hoping the weather is still good when i get there spending many hours packing the truck and trailer and spending 150 on gas and more on camping supplies renders this to a 3 or 4 day trip with loss from work so to be able to use world class equipment under world class skies while sitting at my desk in my robe on sunday morning is just mind boggling thank you
3268992 made me go out and buy my own telescope i will be learning the ropes of astrophotography and having fun with my small refractor and dslr setup
3268993 and then after that come back to use the gras telescopes hopefully with more skills
3268994 i enjoyed using gras as im traveling quite a bit and have no way to image and its become an addiction
3268995 at first there were some difficulties with using gras but the customer response was first rate and i was given extra minutes in compensation after that i took some nice pictures which i was able to manipulate in maxim and photoshop
3268996 much fun i am looking forward in the future to doing some narrow band imaging on your scopes until such a time as i can settle down and set up a permanent observatory of my own
3268997 the global network of gras of telescopes is world class in every respect my first experience of the g13 telescope in south australia produced an awe inspiring image of the triffid nebula
3268998 gras does everything it says on the tin and is backed by lightning speed technical support
3268999 we want to celebrate dog owners who go above and beyond the call of duty to present their dogs as breed ambassadors just about any dog can shine if his owner cares enough to commit to a minimal amount of obedience training pit bulls are generally eager beavers when it comes to learning new things so training comes quickly to most
3269000 ive spent many years volunteering with dog rescues and local humane societies in my community during those years i saw first hand many dogs dropped off at my local shelter because these dogs lacked basic good manners and so i realized that a trained dog is more likely to stay in its home bad rap had an opportunity to create a cgc coaching program for pit bulls in our community and i wanted to be a part of it for every pit bull with a cgc certificate i see one more pit bull with a better chance of being a treasured member of the household

3269040 this time the race is squarely about the performance of democratic gov christine gregoire
3269041 there is certainly another democratic wave being thrown at reichert but it is important to note that democrats have never held this seat since it was created back in 1980
3269042 its just kind of snowballed ive been getting calls from people ive never met in my life
3269043 its preferred option would be to find an alternative venue on the same date september 6th for the group eight world cup qualifier against georgia in tbilisi
3269044 we will keep fans informed of any decision from fifa on this matter and will continue to work with fifa to enable them to make a timely decision
3269045 we have decided to formalise our position to fifa and will be writing to them seeking a change of venue
3269046 we are very concerned about the worsening situation the safety of the players and the fans must be our primary concern we will of course monitor the situation carefully but at this stage we cannot be assured of our safety in georgia
3269047 well work with fifa uefa and the georgian fa to help in whatever way we can to make sure the game does not become a casualty of what is a very sad and difficult situation
3269048 wed like an early decision for the sake of the fans weve had almost 1 000 applications for tickets and while we havent actually sold any at this stage we think its appropriate that those people are clear about whats happening with the game
3269049 is closely monitoring the situation in georgia but at this time it is too early to speculate on any possibilities
3269050 weve been in contact with the georgians and we have expressed to them both our sympathy regarding the situation in their country and our concern for the well being of everyone involved with the association
3269051 its certainly not that were trying to take advantage of the situation simply that theres a fixture schedule and the games have to be played ideally wed like to play our away fixture against georgia in tbilisi but we believe that the priority is that the game is played in the date allocated to it
3269052 there will be further talks regarding the wales v georgia friendly on wednesday the georgian fa are still very keen to play the match but much will depend on events over the next 36 hours

3269093 we just are what we are and have been since the 1930s a working family ranch
3269094 people feel disconnected from where their food comes from and they want to be reconnected
3269095 they want to know the farmer and the rancher taking the family and the children to experience gathering eggs being in a barn seeing how cows are milked is also very important
3269096 most people have no idea this kind of lifestyle still exists in marin
3269097 if theyre interested we take them on a tour of our vegetable garden i tell them about our production and where i sell my produce they can find out about cattle ranching and see the cattle up close
3269098 people often get a good education they re amazed at how much work is involved in farming
3269099 im finding that these days people are also really interested in how we steward the land
3269100 they look at what were doing and we talk about it such as fencing off and planting native plants creek restoration repairing gullies we have a lot of wildlife out here and we ve increased the number and type of native birds through these sustainable practices
3269101 our location is unique in that we are a non profit farm within the golden gate national recreation area right on the pacific ocean he says
3269102 there s a natural hospitality that comes from being a farmer thats an ancient tradition
3269103 anyone who has ever worked on a farm realizes that it s a lot of work you tend to welcome visitors who want to come and help you or learn in any way
3269104 i have met so many people from other ways of life that as a farmer you d never be able to meet

3269106 there is real hope that whats happening in a houston lab might lead to a cure for hiv
3269107 we have found an innovative way to kill the virus by finding this small region of hiv that is unchangeable
3269108 the virus needs at least one constant region and that is the essence of calling it the achilles heel
3269109 what we already have in our hand are the abzymes that we could be infusing into the human subjects with hiv infection essentially to move the virus

3269115 we fully support the initiatives to improve the opportunities in the community
3269116 my colleagues were somewhat disappointed that so much dialogue had been incurred by other parties not including the commission and that the commission received the application when the planning process was fairly far along
3269117 when there are proposals of this magnitude we would believe that the commission would be engaged early on in the process knowing full well that when any activity takes place within the agricultural land reserve the decision rests with the commission
3269118 what we want to do first is make sure the community wants it thats important to us after we hear back from them and know where we stand then we will definitely sit down with the alc for sure

3269125 not currently an obvious digital migration path for digital radio
3269126 it the drwg report has been very useful it has focused the industry everybody now agrees that the future has to be digital
3269127 if we stay in an analogue world of fm and am the industry technology and services are going to become less relevant in a digital age
3269128 the industry hasnt enough to develop a clear consumer proposition and thats what i am hoping to change
3269129 there are now around 30 of cars that come with the option of having dab however it is expensive
3269130 things like traffic radio a dedicated national radio station will give a better reason for consumers to get it and a better reason for manufacturers to make it as its services like this wont or arent available on fm
3269131 there are different flavours to dab dab dab and dmb a however chipset manufacturers have announced that there is a chipset to support all of those and that adds just a 1 to the manufacture of the radio
3269132 yes you pay a price for being first to launch but the notion that we are missing out in the uk is a red herring
3269133 it is important to have devices as future proof as possible but dab isnt an issue for consumers they are only really concerned about what the radio does we arent ruling it out but i wouldnt expect to see a need for dab to be broadcast in the uk for another 5 years at least
3269134 when tv went digital you noticed a massive difference as you went from four channels to hundreds however because radio had masses of channels already national and local people didnt see that benefit
3269135 people want the technology to just work wouldnt it be great to have a radio that knew when to use dab or when to use a wi fi connection if it was connected the message we have to get across is what they can do with their radio
3269136 if you listen to bbc radio and over 50 of listeners do you get twice the number of radio stations on digital digital is also the only way to get virgin in stereo outside london
3269137 what you are going to see in a much bigger way in the next 6 months is more channels channel 4 is going to start launching music channels starting with e4 radio in the next couple of months jazz fm is launching as a dab only channel later this year other launches include talkradio from talksport closer and many more
3269138 it would be great if it adoption in mobile phones happened before christmas but i dont think it will happen everyone is waiting for that 50
3269139 dab is still going to be at the forefront of our plans for digital radio moving forward internet radio offers plenty of stations but internet radio is never going to be easy to use its never going to be as easy to use as dab
3269140 i like to describe the industry as a three legged spoon the first is the device the second ieg the tech it brings to the market and the third leg the content dab has all three we just need to build them further if we are to succeed
3269141 tidak ada seorang pun yang berjalan di air kecuali tumitnya pasti basah demikian pula orang yang memiliki duniawi ia tidak bisa selamat dari dosa dosa
3269142 sekali kali janganlah orang orang yang bakhil dengan harta yang allah berikan kepada mereka dari karunia nya menyangka bahwa kebakhilan itu baik bagi mereka sebenarnya kebakhilan itu adalah buruk bagi mereka harta yang mereka bakhilkan itu akan dikalungkan kelak di lehernya di hari kiamat dan kepunyaan allahlah segala warisan yang ada di langit dan di bumi dan allah mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan
3269143 ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya kehidupan dunia ini hanyalah permainan dan suatu yang melalaikan perhiasan dan bermegah megah antara kamu serta berbangga banggaan tentang banyaknya harta dan anak seperti hujan yang tanam tanamannya mengagumkan para petani kemudian tanaman itu menjadi kering dan kamu lihat warnanya kuning kemudian menjadi hancur dan di akhirat nanti ada azab yang keras dan ampunan dari allah serta keridhaan nya dan kehidupan dunia ini tidak lain hanyalah kesenangan yang menipu
3269144 ambillah zakat dari sebagian harta mereka dengan zakat itu kamu membersihkan dan menyucikan mereka dan mendoalah untuk mereka sesungguhnya doa kamu itu menjadi ketenteraman jiwa bagi mereka dan allah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
3269145 barang siapa yang sederhana terhadap dunia maka allah mengajarkannya sesuatu yang tanpa belajar dan memberinya petunjuk tanpa hidayah secara langsung dan telah menjadikannya melihat dan allah membukakan daripadanya kebutaan

3269160 unless you think that fuel costs are going back to 2005 levels the airlines are really having to adjust to an expectation that costs will stay up in the general neighborhood of where they are
3269161 given that they know they have to make significant changes in the way they do business that includes air fares routes the type of aircraft they fly to say nothing of staffing
3269162 that will be the most difficult weve had since 9 11 when terrorist attacks sent the airline industry into a tailspin

3269184 the malaysian government appears to be manipulating the legal system to shore up support for its continued rule and undermine the opposition
3269185 however this time around the malaysian public is no longer amused or titillated by this sordid allegation rather they are disgusted
3269186 but by allowing the situation to degenerate so far he is indirectly responsible
3269187 they are always wanting to charge anwar and he has been going in and out of the police stations and the courts

3269197 let there be no doubt in your minds that dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destablise this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3269198 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade

3269202 trento reports that sadats vice president hosni mubarak had been on the cia payroll in the late 70s and that he had been having his palms greased by a weapons delivery company called eatsco a cia front side company run by the notorious edwin p wilson
3269203 according to trento anwar sadat had by 1980 started an investigation into mubaraks corrupt involvement with eatsco
3269204 both the cia and mubarak had motives to have sadat dead
3269205 the cia of course having the contract to protect sadat possessed the means at least to leave a critical security door open

3269209 it is believed in some quarters that while omar sheikh was at the lse london school of economics he was recruited by the british intelligence agency mi6

3269228 how to make a claim in virginia for injuries due to a dog bite
3269229 pit bulls and rottweilers are dogs who not only must be handled with special precautions but also must be regulated with special requirements appropriate to the risk they may pose to the public and other animals if they are to be kept at all
3269230 no dog shall be found to be a dangerous dog or vicious dog solely because it is a particular breed nor is a particular breed of dog prohibited
3269231 i was working really hard and doing the program right and it wasnt working like it was meant to
3269232 i went to the doctor and my body doesnt digest certain foods well so i decided it was bad for them and i didnt want to do bad by them
3269233 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go thats a hundred times better than watching on tv
3269234 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it make sure i was well prepared but i do not want to sit there watching it wondering what could have happened
3269235 it gives me a mental lift to have got this far because to be honest if they had told me the bleakest medical diagnosis which came out in dribs and drabs in the end i might have said this is not going to happen
3269236 and there were times in the last 12 weeks when i thought how can this be happening has someone put a jinx on me
3269237 but then id go to bed and think no this is the olympics im not going to give up
3269238 and gary lough her husband and coach said to me someone is testing you to see how much you want it
3269239 it certainly means i have a lot of unfinished business with the olympics but i also think the olympics are something more special anyway
3269240 it was my dream as a little girl you dont dream about world championships you dream about the olympics
3269241 but regardless of what happened four years ago this still would have been something i fought for
3269242 i have not taken stupid risks with my leg but at every point i
3269243 you have to ask yourself are you prepared for the worst thing that can happen and for me the worst thing is not to be able to finish the race and i have already faced that in athens
3269244 there have been points when i really did not think i would make it so i will be the happiest of all the runners on the start line
3269245 the only reason i would not able to finish it would be if my leg could not handle it but i have been encouraged as my leg has been coping with good amounts of running

3269254 weve learned that the nf1 gene affects stature through a different pathway than the one weve previously focused on to understand cancers in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1
3269255 given that this second pathway has been linked to cancer in other contexts we may need to consider the possibility that it is contributing to these tumors and alter our treatment goals accordingly
3269256 we wanted to know if we could blame this on ras protein activity so we generated new mice with normal levels of neurofibromin expression but increased levels of ras activation in brain stem cells however those mice were normal
3269257 what weve learned also may help us gain insight into other disease processes there are a number of other rare genetic abnormalities that cause short stature and this same pathway may be involved
3269258 being human can be so dispiriting it is a real stretch for me a lot of the time
3269259 i feel like people let things get too complex sometimes we need to just keep things simple we need to be more willing to let things go we need to stop blaming others for our mistakes
3269260 we are very grateful for the important leadership of the uae in showing the world how nuclear power can be advanced safely without contributing to nuclear proliferation dangers an iaea controlled fuel bank is essential to reducing global nuclear dangers because the same uranium enrichment technology that is used to make nuclear reactor fuel can also be used to make material for a nuclear weapon

3269342 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3269343 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3269344 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3269345 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3269346 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3269347 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat

3269361 its a little bit frustrating for him right now because some of the stuff is making the same mistakes more than once and weve got to get over that hurdle
3269362 hes probably about par for the course of where he should be
3269363 i feel like im in a decent spot right now its just a matter of staying consistent getting first team reps is a big confidence booster and when you succeed in there and make some plays that also helps

3269370 we no longer have representatives from either major party who have any serious interest in reducing the size of government cutting taxes or getting spending under control
3269371 when you have a republican president who goes and meets behind closed doors with republicans or a democratic president who meets behind closed doors with democrats nothing ever gets done when bob meets with all of them congress is going to see the writing on the wall a libertarian has just been elected president the first time a third party candidate has done this in more than a century in two four or six years their time is coming up

3269375 he lost but he lost with honor i like brave wrestlers he took the challenge
3269376 i was sitting and watching hoping hed beat the russian but he didnt
3269377 hes pretty tough but i was there with him in the first period
3269378 i would have liked a few more seconds to tighten it up
3269379 but he was standing up and it was starting to slip off so i figured id better go before it got any looser when i initially went with it i thought it was going to be able to get it but i couldnt
3269380 im a little down but its just some small mistakes i made
3269381 im going to get back into the practice room work on them and be ready the next time
3269382 the position was 50 50 it could have gone either way he didnt have the real tight lock but it was time to go and thats what i liked about him hes not afraid to try
3269383 he has a lack of experience internationally its the first time hes wrestled this caliber of athletes
3269384 i was in 10th grade when these new rules came out
3269385 my serious greco career has been with these new rules the whole time this is all i know
3269386 either i can be unhappy or be like those are the rules im going to go win under these rules
3269387 at first i was a little hesitant it was a little hard to grasp but i got used to it
3269388 being a classic wrestler i have to go with the old rules
3269389 it was a clash of warriors you brought in conditioning strength technique mental control to be able to outlast your opponent
3269390 im not sure if the guy thats the better man always wins under those rules
3269391 i think a guy that scores six points in a period and then loses 1 0 1 0 is better than the other guy if im the inferior guy id much rather take my chances on a 50 50 ball pull as opposed to a two minute period
3269392 i could have gone to one ncaa tournament 20 years ago show up today and know how a man wins a match

3269397 its a real shame for lucky and disappointing for us because he makes such a huge contribution to the side consistently every week

3269399 we found that qantas comes under fire from some media that clearly contradicts a more widespread view of qantas customers that voted for the airline in the survey

3269411 it was like he has signed his own death warrant
3269412 his wife lived behind the main house with her thai boyfriend every time we went to visit she would come out and scream and order us away this is my house this is my land
3269413 ian knew that he was going to be murdered he had already complained that while he was away she had put something inside a beer in his fridge
3269414 he had felt ill so he sent the beer away for analysis to a local hospital he was awaiting the results
3269415 but it was an open secret in the area that ian was going to be murdered but she had a secret police lover
3269416 when i recently went home to birmingham a policeman told me perhaps your friend will not be alive when you come back
3269417 so when i went to his house on sunday and saw his car was there and the house locked up i knew then his time had come his wife came out shouting at me and my wife to go away we decided to call the police
3269418 ian was a nice and charming man always helping others
3269419 but secretly he was broke and he had nowhere to go once his home had been taken away from him
3269420 he told us all he was going to be murdered and quite frankly we believed him and thought so too
3269421 friends had brought him a stun gun a tazer to use to protect himself we wanted him to go home to england but he was spending his last pennies trying to get his property back he was due in court today
3269422 for the last three months he had been a prisoner in his own house we have been bringing him food but he has been living on mashed potatoes
3269423 ian beestons wife and a thai friend from petchabun province somchit janong 48 have both been arrested for her murder we have assured the british embassy that the investigation will be thorough

3269450 for five years they have had the opportunity to infiltrate us to live among us to pretend to be americans to try to convert others to islam they may even be your friends or neighbors people you trust but little do you know that they plan to explode nuclear weapons in many cities and a list of the cities they have targeted for destruction by suitcase nuclear bombs includes dallas atlanta

3269466 contrasts with a very low level of reserves replacement in recent years low investment in exploration signs of maturity in significant fields and production that is operating to the limit to cover every industry demand
3269467 these figures add up to substantial risk given argentinas heavy dependence on these fuels
3269468 in addition most of the exploration concessions expire between 2015 and 2017 this puts a big constraint on companies incentives to undertake risky investments that are capable of extending the lifespan of reserves when their contracts could expire in seven to nine years
3269469 serves to further strain other sectors at times of peak consumption
3269470 still local production in argentina isnt enough to cover the current demand growth rates
3269471 private companies are investing little in exploration as the risk of doing such work increases and the size of discoveries shrinks as a result argentina could become a net oil importer before 2010 oil can easily be imported but if the country were to lose its own supply it would have to swiftly close the gap between local and international prices
3269472 in this context the fuel market is seen as tight on the short term especially for diesel
3269473 the current frameworks main goal is that firms take the necessary measures to satisfy local demand including mandatory diesel imports at international market prices under this regulatory environment we do not expect the private sector to take large investment initiatives in downstream facilities i e new nonintegrated refineries

3269485 operating and capital cost increases could pressure the companys strong credit profile in the near to intermediate term
3269486 significant cash generated by high gold prices the monetization of the components of its royalty and equity portfolio and an earlier bond issuance have permitted newmont to maintain credit measures that are in line with the rating while continuing to fund its large ongoing capital expenditure program
3269487 reflect the companys position as one of the worlds largest gold producers its significant and diversified reserve base its solid balance sheet strong liquidity and currently favorable gold prices
3269488 exposure to political and sovereign risk and volatile gold prices counterbalance these strengths
3269489 moreover the companys ongoing need to find and develop reserves to replace mature reserves and maintain production levels necessitates very high capital spending over the next couple of years while sharply higher operating costs exposure it to margin erosion in the event gold prices decline
3269490 for the most part succeeded in replacing reserves through exploration and development greenfield and brownfield ventures and acquisitions
3269491 still although consistent with general industry trends we remain concerned about the companys declining production trend which is forecast to range from 5 1 million to 5 4 million equity ounces in 2008 down from the 7 million equity ounces five years ago
3269492 is largely due to decreasing ore grades and reserves depletion
3269493 newmonts costs have risen because of declining ore grades higher strip ratios adverse exchange rate movement and increased costs of labor material and power
3269494 newmonts cash cost was 440 per ounce compared with 237 per ounce as recently as 2005 while some of the cost increase is permanent which increases the companys risk to the volatility in gold prices we expect cost increases to moderate as the company realizes the benefits of its capital programs
3269495 newmont is spending significant capital over the next few years to develop and expand lower cost opportunities in nevada ghana peru and australia and it purchased miramar for future development
3269496 nevertheless the company faces significant challenges in the development of these properties as project costs have risen considerably
3269497 we could revise the outlook to stable in the near term if strong gold prices and more moderate cost increases permit the company to fund its current phase of capital expenditures internally and within its cost guidance
3269498 having said that we see limited potential for raising the ratings given the need for significant capital expenditures to fund and develop reserves inherent operating and political risks and volatile gold prices

3269541 the pace of media is rapidly changing and any media organisation that cuts itself from the world of training is going to become a failing institution and will be further isolated from news ways of storytelling
3269542 we are also seeing a rapid transition towards visuals so the days of being a writer only or concentrating on a specific field of media are now gone there is a need to upgrade journalists skills to make them more versatile to any kind of reporting that comes their way
3269543 we have a much more complex issue in society which is gender and journalists need to mirror society through learning to speak the language of gender knowledge to be able to cover gender related stories very well
3269544 there is a general temptation for journalists to look for superwomen as potential sources especially by focusing on their relationships and private lives which is stereotypical and discriminatory while a large part of our communities rural women and rural children is absent from our media world especially newspapers
3269545 rural women have very important stories to tell but their voices can only be heard through radio
3269546 unfortunately radio is ephemeral meaning one or two broadcast programmes and then gone and forgotten we need the presence of print media in rural areas encouraging magazines and newspapers to send their staff to cover stories in rural society i think it is a dilemma but we would need the support of advertisers to achieve that feat
3269547 training institutions must also enter the fray and play a vital part in this struggle
3269548 sometimes newsrooms are not compatible with womens issues or are not that women friendly myths of male superiority and female mediocrity still prevail
3269549 so perhaps media training institutions should develop courses especially for women remove gender stereotypes in their curriculums and recruit more women into their ranks but mostly female journalists must do their best to advance themselves
3269550 it is still a complicated system out there full of old men who resist change so we need the full support of these organisations

3269583 as the ceremony got under way with a dramatic drummed countdown viewers watching at home and on giant screens inside the birds nest national stadium watched as a series of giant footprints outlined in fireworks processed gloriously above the city from tiananmen square what they did not realise was that what they were watching was in fact computer graphics meticulously created over a period of months and inserted into the coverage electronically at exactly the right moment the fireworks were there for real outside the stadium but those responsible for filming the extravaganza decided in advance it would be impossible to capture all 29 footprints from the air as a result only the last visible from the camera stands inside the birds nest was captured on film the trick was revealed in a local chinese newspaper the beijing times at the weekend

3269596 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3269597 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up the sting

3269600 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3269601 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect everyone was excellent
3269602 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3269603 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3269604 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3269605 i just went up there wanting to put the ball in play
3269606 i made good contact and the ball just took off you dont go up there looking for home runs but when they help the team win its a good feeling
3269607 in a hard close game like that one guy can mean winning or losing we dont win tonight without his effort
3269608 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3269609 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3269610 its been an interesting last month but i think our team has gotten pretty tight
3269611 the support from our teammates throughout the day today was definitely encouraging
3269612 i was just hoping i was going the right direction
3269613 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3269614 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him
3269615 i can pretty confidently say that no other quarterback in the league has ever stepped into a situation that hes stepped into
3269616 but hes handled it tremendously he played extremely well tonight and you could tell the organization you can tell why they have confidence in him
3269617 once we got going we were sharp we were crisp we moved the ball effectively and got a couple of touchdowns
3269618 it was just good to just get that first game rust off and get some confidence on those last couple of drives and get ready for the next one
3269619 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3269620 im going to go out and have some fun like i always do every year
3269621 yall know how i am im going to have fun trust me

3269624 our communities are the ones who suffer more than any other communities the poor and the underrepresented
3269625 let me step in here pastor jones we very much appreciate your presence here today and youre right the community should be part of the discussion and it is

3269628 our neighbors have started to realize iraq is on the road to recovery
3269629 our neighbors have started to realize that iraq is on the road to recovery
3269630 their wait and see attitude and hesitancy has gone this is a national unity government
3269631 in just a few hours we didnt launch into deep discussions
3269632 we discussed how economic relations could flourish between us jordan has a key interest and strategic relationship with iraq
3269633 its a very clear message to the insurgents that there will be no other chance
3269634 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
3269635 let there be no doubt in your minds that the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house
3269636 in the absence of a current budget or other available appropriation the office of the state controller is prohibited by state law from paying state employees their salaries

3269640 we believe your order fails to ensure the safety at these prisons the officers and staff the 170 000 inmates incarcerated and anyone who lives within a 50 mile radius

3269642 we have and will continue to review exemption requests for public safety and we are also reviewing exemption requests in corrections
3269643 its not the only reason people distrust the legislature but its one of the reasons
3269644 and despite the fact that were all professional and you never talk about legislation its just too close not illegal just too close for comfort
3269645 we all try to pitch in and help elect more democrats

3269652 it was the noise i heard the noise it was just a very very strong wind
3269653 the bedroom window was open the wind started shaking it then all the windows in the house started shaking
3269654 i just noticed everything was up in the air and going over to the neighbours property
3269655 like going through a car wash and said the damage could have been a lot worse
3269656 i think we were very lucky it just missed the house she and her family had been out this morning trying to clean up

3269675 i feel like once you played the game and youve played it on several different levels it kind of comes natural to you
3269676 its about going out there and learning the terminology of a new defense

3269680 heads of private channels assemble to consider the allocated air time and the issue is solved through the chairmanship of the national tv and radio council before the elections later the air time is announced free air time will be announced as soon as presidential candidates pass registration
3269681 a casting of lots will take place with participation of all candidates candidates themselves must decide how to use their air time it means candidates will decide how much time to allocate for their speech and debates the central election commission will also participate in the process candidates themselves must decide how to divide three hours air time we will carry out their will

3269691 we might have been down a little bit but we felt in a comfortable zone
3269692 pairs are a little bit slower moving we werent too worried the race is pretty long
3269693 our focus was to get into a long good rhythm not win in 10 strokes but take a couple more inches each stroke for the next few hundred meters we werent at all frantic in that situation we just wanted to focus on our own rhythm and set it and it worked
3269694 this is our first international race rowing as a pair together
3269695 we really didnt do much in terms of rowing and physical exercise in between the two races we tried to relax and rest as much as possible to be fresh
3269696 we wanted to be little bit longer and get more run out of the boat and let it do a little more work for us

3269737 there has to be a compelling governmental interest to justify treating people equally situated in a different manner
3269738 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts

3269813 will come off as a complete loser by accepting unconditional surrender even if it makes a few demands
3269814 the purpose of the greater east asia war is to achieve a stable east asia for the survival and defence of the nation
3269815 the sacrifice of so many people who died in the war would go unrequited if this purpose remains unfulfilled
3269816 i sold off all my products and i was forced to order for more from rwanda before the exhibition ended

3269819 in june surveyors reported that predatory buyers were bargain hunting for property
3269820 this month surveyors report that realism has returned to the market with many sellers dropping asking prices to more realistic levels
3269821 the lack of mortgage finance has brought the housing market to a virtual standstill with first time buyers rapidly becoming an endangered species
3269822 going forward there are signs that sales activity might pick up a little as sellers start to re evaluate unrealistic asking prices

3269828 i think you have got to put a lot of that down to the preoccupation with security
3269829 but security youre in the hands of the host organisers
3269830 and they havent been able to manage the balance between security and creating that atmosphere i suppose
3269831 its not the first i certainly remember it in 1992 barcelona there were those tanks outside every olympic family hotel
3269832 and certainly that was the case in 76 and the case in 80

3269871 i think a big thing in playing first grade is confidence and hes naturally a very confident kid
3269872 theres certain guys who can play first grade at a young age and theres certain ones youve got to leave a little bit longer but i thought confidence wise he doesnt lack anything there
3269873 in all honesty hes not really ready for first grade

3269883 not at all given the laziness of mr ofarrell it might be of service to his people
3269884 of far more interest to my mps and to everyone is the type of things were doing like this rather than a wayward email
3269885 deflect attention from the iemma governments incompetence by being even more incompetent
3269886 memo to adam walters and john choueifate the first lesson in politics is work out who is on your side

3269888 eg it has been revealed 80 gazillion people own a boat or something like that
3269889 the international society should immediately get involved and demand that china stop the repression
3269890 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3269891 one is the sophisticated co ordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organisation to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3269892 we are seeing utter destitution we see malnutrition we are seeing depression we see homelessness people are coming to us from a place of crisis
3269893 there are still a number of people in the community who came out during world youth day there is certainly an expectation that some will decide to seek asylum rather that return

3269940 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
3269941 i knew koreas taehwan park was going to have a good last 50 so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3269942 i wanted to just get through the 200 fly race try not to go all out try to be conservative a little bit
3269943 i felt fine im not coming back tonight im just recovering back at the village and preparing for wednesdays race those are two big races
3269944 it might be once in a century when youll see something like this

3269952 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
3269953 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
3269954 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3269955 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3269956 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3269957 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3269958 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3269959 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3269960 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change
3269961 a warmer atmosphere contains larger amounts of moisture which boosts the intensity of heavy downpours
3269962 comparing observations with results from computer models improves understanding of how rainfall responds to a warming world
3269963 differences can relate to deficiencies in the measurements or the models used to predict future climatic change
3269964 to my mind its yet another piece of strong evidence in support of the hobbit having an ancient lineage not something closely related to modern humans let alone a diseased individual of our species importantly this new study continues to undermine claims that the hobbit suffered from a medical condition known as microcephaly that is a modern human with an abnormally small brain by looking at a part of the anatomy far removed from the head namely the wrist bones microcephalics do not have unusually shaped wrist bones but the hobbit does and the features of the wrist bones are echoed in the primitive traits seen in many other parts of the skeleton including the skull which has been almost the sole focus of attention of the pro microcephaly camp
3269965 awarding the olympics to china was certainly motivated and inspired by a noble idea but the experiment has failed
3269966 china is not any more open or transparent or democratic and from the looks of it it may actually take a few steps backwards after the games are over
3269967 im not sure thats going to last because olympic season has just started
3269968 i feel that so far ive been the unbending one and shes been quite tolerant
3269969 the olympics are a very big deal for these folks and they share the sentiments of most chinese that protesters and critics are being unfair to china
3269970 you could certainly watch it and sit down with your family and use it as a forum to discuss broader issues
