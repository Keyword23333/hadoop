8690000 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea
8690001 come everyone will say let us go up the mountain of the lord to the temple of the god of israel there he will teach us his laws and we will obey them for in those days the world will be ruled from jerusalem the lord will settle international disputes all the nations will convert their weapons of war into implements of peace then at the last all wars will stop and all military training will end
8690002 for as in adam all die even so in christ all shall be made alive
8690003 the lord is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
8690004 but the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished
8690005 anyone then who knows the right thing to do and fails to do it commits sin
8690006 whoever comes to me and hears my sayings and does them i will show you whom he is like he is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock
8690007 but he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation against which the stream beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great
8690008 therefore as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion of the ancient israelites as on the day of testing in the wilderness where your ancestors put me to the test though they had seen my works for forty years
8690009 they always go astray in their hearts and they have not known my ways

8690021 halloween is the name for the eve of samhain a celebration marking the beginning of winter as well as the first day of the new year within the ancient celtic culture of the british isles the time of samhain consisted of the eve of the feast and the day itself 31 october and 1 november
8690022 on this occasion it was believed that a gathering of supernatural forces occurred as during no other period of the year
8690023 fiery tributes and sacrifices of animals crops and possibly human beings were made to appease supernatural powers who controlled the fertility of the land samhain acknowledged the entire spectrum of nonhuman forces that roamed the earth during the period
8690024 huge bonfires were set on hilltops to frighten away evil spirits the souls of the dead were supposed to revisit their homes on this day and the autumnal festival acquired sinister significance with ghosts witches hobgoblins black cats fairies and demons of all kinds said to be roaming about it was the time to placate the supernatural powers controlling the processes of nature
8690025 samhain remained a popular festival among the celtic people throughout the christianization of great britain the british church attempted to divert this interest in pagan customs by adding a christian celebration to the calendar on the same date as samhain the christian festival the feast of all saints commemorates the known and unknown saints of the christian religion just as samhain had acknowledged and paid tribute to the celtic deities
8690026 take heed to yourself that you are not ensnared to follow them after they are destroyed from before you and that you do not inquire after their gods saying how did these nations serve their gods
8690027 the lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance what kind of people ought you to be you ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of god
8690028 only by dying could he break the power of the devil who had the power of death
8690029 did god make man in his image or did god intend man to remake god in mans image
8690030 modern halloween activities have centered on mischief making and masquerading in costumes often resembling otherworldly characters
8690031 children are particularly susceptible to the imagery of halloween as can be seen in their fascination with the demonic likeness of a carved and illuminated pumpkin known as the jack o lantern in recent times children have taken up the practice of dressing in halloween costumes and visiting homes in search of edible and monetary treats lightly threatening to play a trick on the owner if a treat is not produced

8690038 that is great news for angel investors and angel funds
8690039 to keep up the current pace of investment and incubation and capitalize on current low valuations and low operating costs for funding startups now is good time to raise an early stage fund

8690041 i will never permit one of my papers to upset my friend dick nixon
8690042 freedom of the press belongs to the man who owns one
8690043 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8690044 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8690045 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8690046 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do
8690047 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8690048 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
8690049 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
8690050 clinton is the first woman to run for this prestigious office
8690051 the way to influence behavior like that is to first raise peoples level of consciousness
8690052 we know were not perfect but were always striving to do the best for the environment
8690053 there is currently no company policy about opening or closing doors but we acknowledge the need to minimize energy use and are investigating different strategies such as using air fans which would prevent the cold air from leaving the building even with the door open
8690054 i would say something about it we are the customers and so i think they would value hearing from us
8690055 i would probably go in and say were all trying to conserve energy pasadena is a very green city so it would be best if you didnt pour your air conditioning into the outside world and i might say that im not inclined to shop in a place that hasnt caught on to the green spirit of pasadena
8690056 the information avalanche coming from all sides the internet pdas hundreds of television channels is burying us in extraneous data that prevent important facts and knowledge from reaching a broad audience
8690057 its possible that over time an energy tax by making some computers web sites blogs and perhaps cable tv channels too costly to maintain could reduce the supply of information
8690058 to achieve their goals political movements need to reach and influence tens of millions of citizens despite conventional thinking that the internet helps spread information such reach is actually impossible online
8690059 candidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8690060 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8690061 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8690062 full of meaning and full of opportunity and if you as i believe and i know a lot of you do we did not lose the last election nor did al gore lose his last election we won it
8690063 ill screw around on my sick wife and make her lie in front of the cameras about it
8690064 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8690065 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue

8690074 it really lets the kids construct their own understanding and age is no barrier to what they can do
8690075 its kids teaching kids and how to learn in kids language

8690077 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
8690078 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
8690079 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
8690080 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
8690081 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
8690082 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
8690083 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
8690084 plea for a politics of consensus serving as a warning against single issue political movements or against the separation of america into racial ethnic or gender based constituencies
8690085 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8690086 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8690087 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8690088 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8690089 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision

8690112 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8690113 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8690114 television has the greatest potential to inform and educate in the history of any medium
8690115 think of it this way the people having the most kids today are uneducated and poor so within a few years we will have a pretty dumb country
8690116 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8690117 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8690118 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8690119 i wish i had know this before we had three
8690120 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8690121 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8690122 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8690123 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8690124 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8690125 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8690126 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8690127 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8690128 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8690129 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8690130 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8690131 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8690132 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8690133 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8690134 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
8690135 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
8690136 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8690137 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8690138 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8690139 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8690140 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8690141 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8690142 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8690143 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8690144 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8690145 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8690146 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8690147 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8690148 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8690149 what i am opposed to is a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8690150 eight years ago such a scenario would have been laughable obama was broke and without political friends of any consequence
8690151 raise taxes raise some more taxes and weaken the military
8690152 all he wants to talk about is raising the taxes on the oil companies but what the majority of americans dont understand is that the oil companies are publicly owned so their profits are your profits if you have a 401k or mutual funds
8690153 the next six months are going to tell the story
8690154 the long answer is well ive lived in the philly area for most of my life and i know it well maybe too well so i figure nows my chance to get to know somewhere else l a is sunny and theres good vegetarian food
8690155 not only because people seemed to really appreciate it but because talking to farmers was like some kind of therapy so nice and relaxing made me want to quit journalism and become a farmer
8690156 im hoping california is like one big headhouse market everywhere you look fruits and veggies even if its not that way im going to have a little yard out there and i plan to start a garden so i will send you a tomato and you can decide
8690157 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8690158 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8690159 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8690160 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8690161 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8690162 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8690163 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8690164 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8690165 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8690166 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8690167 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8690168 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8690169 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8690170 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8690171 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8690172 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8690173 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8690174 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8690175 ben heu cest parce que cest pas de ma faute et ho jai pas trop tellement fait expr s ben oui
8690176 i have learned in whatever state i am to be content
8690177 whoever has no rule over his own spirit is like a city broken down without walls
8690178 you will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you because he trusts in you
8690179 yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for you are with me
8690180 oh that you had heeded my commandments then your peace would have been like a river and your righteousness like the waves of the sea
8690181 the l ord your god is with you wherever you go
8690182 god is not the author of confusion but of peace
8690183 repent and let every one of you be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission forgiveness of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit
8690184 the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness self control
8690185 hatred contentions jealousies outbursts of wrath selfish ambitions dissensions heresies envy murders drunkenness revelries and the like
8690186 grace to you and peace from god the father and our lord jesus christ
8690187 if it is possible as much as depends on you live peaceably with all men
8690188 have no anxiety about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to god and the peace of god which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
8690189 these things i have spoken to you that my joy may remain in you and that your joy may be full
8690190 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8690191 i picked a couple of new ideas lets hope i can now surf ha ha
8690192 content is very useful and great to have a local product
8690193 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8690194 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine
8690195 do you think that john mccain at home in one of his many houses could ever relate to the pain of a single mom with cancer trying to raise kids and make ends meet when he cant even remember how many houses he owns
8690196 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8690197 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8690198 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8690199 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8690200 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8690201 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8690202 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8690203 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8690204 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8690205 je retrouve le psv eindhoven un club avec qui jai t champion 8 fois en 10 ans cest une grande quipe qui a beaucoup dexp rience puisquelle est qualifi e tous les ans en ligue des champions il ne faut pas la sous estimer la seule d ception cest de tomber sur latletico madrid je ne voulais pas avoir cette quipe liverpool est en principe le favori de la poule mais latletico cest aussi fort que liverpool la qualification nest pas impossible mais ce sera dur si on se qualifie on va se r galer
8690206 what a year we democrats have had the primary began with an all star line up and it came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest right to the very end that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming
8690207 we reserve the right to take advantage of an occasional powder day or a day on the lake when its calm and the water is warm is that so bad
8690208 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8690209 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8690210 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8690211 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8690212 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards
8690213 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8690214 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8690215 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8690216 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8690217 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8690218 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8690219 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8690220 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8690221 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8690222 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8690223 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8690224 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8690225 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8690226 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8690227 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8690228 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8690229 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8690230 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8690231 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8690232 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8690233 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8690234 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8690235 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8690236 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8690237 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8690238 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8690239 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8690240 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8690241 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8690242 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8690243 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8690244 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8690245 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8690246 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8690247 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8690248 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8690249 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8690250 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8690251 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8690252 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8690253 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8690254 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8690255 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8690256 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8690257 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8690258 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8690259 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8690260 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8690261 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8690262 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8690263 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8690264 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8690265 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8690266 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8690267 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8690268 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8690269 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
8690270 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
8690271 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8690272 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8690273 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8690274 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8690275 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8690276 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8690277 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8690278 if george w bush was seeking re election wed be 20 points ahead
8690279 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8690280 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8690281 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8690282 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8690283 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8690284 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8690285 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8690286 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8690287 i love zombie games and almost every game that has zombies in them the resident evil series was one of the first into depth game i played when i was younger
8690288 because i liked the 1st so much and have played it 2 3 times
8690289 im excited for that game because it has a bunch of new types of pi atas and because it has new levels coming out that you can play co op on also you can share your garden on xbox live unlike the old viva pi ata
8690290 fable was one of the most enjoyable games that ive played i loved just how many different paths you could take it was more like
8690291 cause its a great role playing game very deep story to it
8690292 the multiplayer looks so gooood and there are so many new features that i cant wait to check out and then theres the campaign that looks so much better than the first plus gears is my favorite game by far and it can only get better
8690293 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8690294 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8690295 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8690296 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8690297 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8690298 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8690299 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8690300 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8690301 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8690302 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8690303 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
8690304 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
8690305 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
8690306 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
8690307 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
8690308 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
8690309 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8690310 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8690311 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8690312 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
8690313 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
8690314 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8690315 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8690316 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8690317 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8690318 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral candidate mccain criticizes senator mccains own climate change bill candidate mccain says he would now vote against the immigration bill that senator mccain wrote are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8690319 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8690320 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8690321 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8690322 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8690323 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8690324 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8690325 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8690326 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8690327 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8690328 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8690329 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8690330 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8690331 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8690332 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8690333 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8690334 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8690335 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8690336 men of goodwill can disagree and still love their country and want the best for her
8690337 i consider president george w bush the greatest president this country has ever had
8690338 lets not judge them too harshly we have a hundred years of history to study since president bush they did not
8690339 what i havent heard about gas going to 4 a gallon
8690340 is the world a safer place upon his her departure fromt the world stage in all tests gwb is and will always be a great world leader
8690341 the repubs are trying to use hillary supporters as they do all the other factions of their party get them angry win their votes then abandon them amp their ideals when they are elected into office
8690342 the way i see it many conservatives are doing more to hurt america than any minority group has thus far all most minorities are trying to do is live the american dream
8690343 conservatives has been living the american dream so they are easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the fox news types
8690344 easily manipulated by stupid emotional issues packaged amp served to them by the
8690345 they live lavish with their large bank accounts amp ignore those of us who are struggling then when the bad news bite them in the butt they look to the federal government to bail them out just like the minorities
8690346 we should be holding the rush limbaugh amp sean hannity types accountable for their role in giving us the bu h crime family
8690347 for example detroit whose mayor has been indicted on felony charges hasnt elected a republican mayor since 1961 buffalo has been even more stubborn it started putting a democrat in office back in 1954 and it hasnt stopped since unfortunately those two cities may be alone at the top of the poverty rate list but theyre not alone in their love for democrats cincinnati ohio third on the poverty rate list hasnt had a republican mayor since 1984 cleveland ohio fourth on the list has been led by a democrat since 1989 st louis missouri sixth hasnt had a republican since 1949 milwaukee wisconsin eighth since 1908 philadelphia pennsylvania ninth since 1952 and newark new jersey 10th since 1907 the only two cities in the top 10 that i didnt mention miami florida and el paso texas havent had republicans in office either just democrats independents or nonpartisans over the past 50 years the eight cities listed above have had republican leadership for a combined 36 years the rest of the time a combined 364 years theyve been led by democrats five of the 10 cities with the highest poverty rates detroit buffalo st louis milwaukee philadelphia and newark have had a democratic stranglehold since at least 1961 more than 45 years two of the cities milwaukee and newark have been electing democrats since the first model t rolled off the assembly line in 1908
8690348 a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes
8690349 its going to take a major hit on america with thousands of lives lost before anybody will do anything your son and his mates lives are not enough to get their presidents politicians attention
8690350 i will put my trust in the promises of god and since i am trusting him what can mere man do to me they are always twisting what i say all their thoughts are how to harm me
8690351 ill be long gone before some smart person ever figures out what happened inside this oval office
8690352 no my life is not better off in fact it is worse
8690353 i dont use liberal talking points i excrete liberal talking points
8690354 i dont use liberal talking points i create liberal talking points
8690355 he also says listing to his one sided rhetoric that comes to you via radio station filled with one sided propagandist looking to get rich by blindly riding off his coattail
8690356 calypso you speak like a true mind numbed liberal i am going to address your point bullet by bullet
8690357 you talk of how the cia tortures prisoners and yet say nothing of how our people have been tortured and murdered i guess it is not ok to merely waterboard a terrorist who by the way is not subject to the protection of the geneva convention but it is ok to be beheaded by a rusty and dull sword
8690358 do our people get that and what about abu graib do you know what those photos look like saturday night and ted kennedys oh the poor terrorist had to wear panties on his head boo hoo
8690359 show me the proof of the thousands upon thousands of dead civilians that were murdered by saddam just because some code pink moonbat says it doesnt mean it is true please provide any credible report
8690360 an excess mortality of nearly 100 000 deaths was reported in iraq for the period march 2003 september 2004 attributed to the invasion of iraq
8690361 i take it then you were for the surpeme court decision to upholding the decision to negate the dc ban on handguns i mean hey they were protecting the second amendment
8690362 at this point in the war name me all the people affected by the patriot act that were unfairly targeted by the patriot act i bet if bill clinton had wanted the patriot act youd have loved it
8690363 and what is that other than the fact that you hate bush
8690364 force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention while material gain or maintaining economies is not
8690365 just war conduct should be governed by the principle of minimum force
8690366 were you for or against the war in kosovo and why
8690367 when did this happen i mean in the last ten years bush never did this
8690368 show us the proof why this was pure conjecture there is proof that the military votes were infringed according to the fec
8690369 was that bushs fault what did he do or not do what did the local people do or not do did you know that there was a plan to reinforce the levees and when it came time to do so the environmentalists filed a lawsuit against the army corp of engineers and won thus repventing any more work from happening did you know that instead of using the federal money they got to improve the bilge pumps new orleans officials built a casino the locals had ample changes to either help prevent problems or get people out and they did nothing and they are democrats one and all
8690370 ahhh the swift boat attacks oh boo hoo i have yet to see john kerry sue any of those men for slander or release his military records compared to some of the filth i have seen posted against bush i would say kerry had it easy he could dish it out but he couldnt take it please do find a single thing the swift boat veterans said that wasnt true and post back
8690371 who cares i do give a crap if he unites us or not i want him to follow and implements the republican platform i take it the messiah will unite us wioh that extremely liberal racord fat chance
8690372 what science global warming that isnt science they have proven nothing there is no proof just conjecture they used phony data and no scientific method to prove their claims just alot of bullying tactics alternative energy has been around for 30 years and is has gotten no where nuclear is alernative energy can we use that
8690373 so what he has kept us and you safe id rather have him than some phony who reads a teleprompter well but has no orgininal thought
8690374 o aumento qualitativo e quantitativo da criminalidade especialmente violenta e o sentimento de inseguran a que se tem instalado entre os cidad os
8690375 o hiper garantismo concedido aos arguidos colide com o direito das v timas com o prest gio das institui es e dificulta e impede muitas vezes o combate eficaz criminalidade complexa
8690376 ac es concertadas entre o minist rio p blico e os rg os de pol cia criminal
8690377 a coopera o a partilha de informa o em tempo til a especializa o e a articula o de esfor os
8690378 essenciais para a obten o de resultados contra uma criminalidade cada vez mais organizada e global
8690379 deve ser proposta a pris o preventiva sempre que se mostrem verificados os pressupostos
8690380 pugnar pela realiza o de julgamentos em processo sum rio sempre que se mostrem reunidas as condi es para tal
8690381 que a pequena criminalidade potencia muitas vezes a grande criminalidade
8690382 no one who believes in him will be put to shame
8690383 every one who calls upon the name of the lord will be saved
8690384 how beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news
8690385 lord who has believed what he has heard from us
8690386 weve just tried to recognize and memorialize what bill has done
8690387 i think this is very appropriate for bill and im glad we were able to do it
8690388 this field is dedicated in honor of legendary 49ers head coach bill walsh and the players he inspired to greatness his genius brought three world championships to san francisco and forever changed the game of football his legacy lives on with those who set foot on this field
8690389 shortly after his death at 75 on july 30 from leukemia the playing surface at candlestick was christened bill walsh field however no visual evidence was established to show that the field has been named for walsh
8690390 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8690391 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8690392 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8690393 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8690394 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8690395 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8690396 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8690397 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8690398 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8690399 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8690400 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8690401 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8690402 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8690403 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8690404 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8690405 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8690406 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8690407 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8690408 this thing only does half what it should but its in perfect shape otherwise oh i should also mention that its hard to fix i could have spent a few bucks to fix it by sending it to the modder who lives here in australia with me but ill leave that to you
8690409 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8690410 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8690411 air france klm confirms its interest and its wish to continue as the strategic partner for alitalia
8690412 with this in mind and if prospects for the new company are confirmed air france klm is ready to take a minority stake in the capital of the new company alongside the investors gathered together by italian bank intesa sanpaolo
8690413 we received the information from the italian authorities in the form of a draft text for the privatisation plans for alitalia
8690414 at this stage it would be quite unwise to make any substantive comments on the text itself
8690415 we continue to see these asset writedowns dribble out quarter after quarter
8690416 my expectation is that until we see some substantial improvement in capital markets thats likely going to continue to be the case although i dont think we see any outside writedowns going forward
8690417 our ability meet our objectives has been impacted by the writedowns as well as higher provisions for credit losses in u s banking however our capital position remains strong
8690418 we look at the u s with a tremendous amount of caution given the current operating environment
8690419 the airlines flights will continue to operate and the decision to instigate creditor protection proceedings means that the demands of existing creditors are frozen while we continue negotiations on an investment package which already are at an advanced stage
8690420 we always stand ready to bring additional relief to the market if its necessary
8690421 the big natgas storage build is lending a bearish tone to the market even as everyone is still watching gustav closely
8690422 most of the advisers i meet really dont understand the bond market and some of them are really open about it
8690423 a basic canadian domestic bond fund is not all that sexy it doesnt have the sex appeal
8690424 people trust the banks and theyre in love with their gics
8690425 we believe that once people understand what bonds are and what theyre getting theyll be very happy because its a lot more flexible than a gic
8690426 bonds are the one asset class that do wonderfully well when the world is fairly grim
8690427 at this point in time when as we think the world is not looking all that bright it makes sense to be long in bonds and take advantage of the negative things that are happening
8690428 the beauty of bonds is that theyre the precise opposite of the stock market
8690429 if you buy stocks and the economy does well you do great but you do horribly if the economy does poorly when you buy bonds youre basically hedging your exposure to that because bonds do well in the exact opposite situation
8690430 where things get a little bit complicated is if the prevailing interest rate in the market changes over those five years other people may be willing to pay you more of less for that bond
8690431 if you get a five per cent bond and the prevailing interest rate falls to four per cent you still get your five per cent
8690432 if youre truly worried about the world government bonds are the place to be theyre the safest place simply because governments as a general rule dont go under
8690433 the downside is that youre not going to get a great rate of return because the uncertainty is so low
8690434 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8690435 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8690436 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8690437 the volunteers have been deployed to assist the passengers weve got our food providers helping them out with snacks and stuff to try and make the best of a very challenging situation for them
8690438 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
8690439 normal course of business to further pursue other gold mining opportunities in venezuela by offering fair value to gold reserve and its shareholders
8690440 we need to give incentives to producers because people are buying and eating more
8690441 this is our opportunity to produce and export more and help to reduce hunger in the world
8690442 we have 22 of our 38 facilities in guelph so the vast majority of the impact would be felt in guelph but its not limited just to ontario
8690443 were at a point now with the volume reductions being what they are that weve had no choice but to start looking at our workforce and conducting temporary layoffs
8690444 its probably momentary i think its going to run right back up because of
8690445 it is still potentially going towards the oil assets of the us gulf but current forecasts are not showing it to be the mother of all hurricanes
8690446 for a recession the us economy is certainly growing very quickly
8690447 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8690448 suggests a more stable dollar in the long run which should help keep overall foreign exchange market volatility low
8690449 the sharp decline in house prices persisted into august as weak buyer confidence and tight lending criteria continued to weigh on the market
8690450 we always stand ready to bring additional relief to the market if its necessary
8690451 the big natgas storage build is lending a bearish tone to the market even as everyone is still watching gustav closely
8690452 as everybody is aware certainly valuations in the u s have dropped very dramatically although the u s marketplace is not without its challenges
8690453 i would say that we look at the u s with a tremendous amount of caution given the current operating environment but we also want to be positioned to take advantage of opportunities
8690454 we certainly dont want to do anything thats going to compromise the financial strength and the performance of the organization
8690455 ive said many times before that while u s banking gets a lot of attention because of whats going on there we continue to look at opportunities across all of our businesses
8690456 weve got a pretty aggressive but disciplined approach in terms of looking at ways where we can invest capital wisely and take advantages of opportunities given the turmoil and its not all related to u s retail banking
8690457 its just not something that strategically we think makes sense
8690458 canadian banks dont have to clean up from the popping of that u s housing bubble
8690459 i would say that we look at the u s with a tremendous amount of caution given the current operating environment but we also want to be positioned to take advantage of opportunities
8690460 you continue to see the domestic numbers look pretty good
8690461 the key to owning a bank in this environment is to have one that has very good retail banking
8690462 results were ahead of our expectations in the u s and slightly ahead in canada offsetting a weak quarter at td securities
8690463 people always say national doesnt have retail scale across the country but if you do banking well in one area and you have the niche you can make a lot of money
8690464 how significant will this turn in the credit cycle be thats hard to predict
8690465 investors seem to have taken a positive view toward the banks even though some of them have not met expectations
8690466 it seems like its macabre reasoning that it could have been much worse
8690467 thats when we began to examine how we do things
8690468 what we were trying to do is create consistency on this practice throughout the city we wanted everyone to have the same procedure
8690469 this certainly sends the message to me that they are not complying with the public records law
8690470 these prices seem to go beyond imposing a reasonable fee
8690471 i think that some people are trying to figure out some bottoming process and they might have come in here and come in early or they may feel a trading stance is warranted
8690472 sometimes it just takes a lack of horrendous news to allow something to fall back up if you push a spring down hard enough it will snap back at you almost every time even one thats pretty rusty and old
8690473 weighing together likely slowdowns in export growth and consumer spending and the continued troubles in the banking and housing sectors forecasters expect gdp growth to slow to about 1 5 per cent in the third quarter and to near zero in the fourth
8690474 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play

8690490 going to the game its one quiet airplane everyone is focused in on the game plan and their assignments theyre either studying or sleeping but when the games over coming back its like a circus in there the coaches are standing in the back mingling talking
8690491 the linemen get a middle seat in between them because they think theyre big i dont think theyre that big mays is 6 foot 3 and weighs 230 pounds were all jammed in the defensive backs linebackers probably have it the worst the linemen have their space and they think theyre better than everybody else
8690492 we get all the free cheese we can eat being from the midwest thats my favorite thing babybel cheese theyve got the red ones and the yellow one its all about the cheese
8690493 when i worked with frank and saw his expertise when he became available with the dismantling of ravens staff i started thinking what kind of an advantage we might gain from that given the talent level is on par with most of the teams we played we werent going to line up and beat people walking out tunnel
8690494 i went to one just to see it and wow
8690495 depth is important especially in the hot southern california weather
8690496 one of the hottest games i have ever been a part of was in 1997 against ucla in the rose bowl were doing extra conditioning to prepare for it
8690497 its going to be heavier than vol 3 but just as weird and as experimental
8690498 the high capacities and performance of the sandisk extreme iii 30mb s edition sdhc cards give users the freedom to shoot lots of high resolution photos and video clips
8690499 the combination of our new sandisk extreme iii 30 mb s edition sdhc card technology and the nikon d90 camera maximizes performance
8690500 increasingly were seeing more second or third time digital camera buyers upgrading to more technologically advanced prosumer dslrs because they offer richer feature sets at more affordable prices than ever before
8690501 the new sandisk extreme iii cards provide optimal performance levels and high capacity points to match that latest technology innovation
8690502 whether capturing a special moment in sports a wilderness hike or just your toddler running across the room life doesnt always stop when you want to take a picture the combination of the new nikon d90 camera and sandisk extreme iii 30mb s edition sdhc cards helps ensure that photographers capture winning action shots and experience quicker transfer of files from the cameras memory card to a computer
8690503 about a third had a professional practice or worked in the corporate world only 3 percent inherited their wealth
8690504 landlords can depreciate their commercial properties and expenses like mortgage interest
8690505 there are trusts and other mechanisms the superrich use to shield their wealth
8690506 the median college grade point average for millionaires is 2 9 and the is 1190
8690507 59 percent of millionaires attended a state college or university
8690508 we have agreed that no one should interfere with the others work
8690509 the world is keeping an eye on us and the differences among us are known
8690510 there is a great concern as people are experiencing trauma and financial strain due to the new rates policy
8690511 we had requested that the implementation be deferred to july 2009 this would allow time for the council to plan properly complete administrative tasks such as capturing individual addresses of sectional title holders
8690512 this change has caused additional work for managing agents who have planned ahead regarding adjustments in levies in conjunction with the bodies corporates
8690513 we received very few applications so far and we believe that there are many more property owners who may qualify and who have not submitted their forms yet
8690514 this would allow pensioners who may have been prejudiced because they do not have a rates account number to submit their query
8690515 we have not lost that capacity indeed the last decade and more has demonstrated that we are able to work together to build our economy to provide for the most basic needs of millions of our people to make unprecedented advances in access to healthcare and education
8690516 we have been able working together to play a leading role in the reconstruction of our continent and in forging a better world
8690517 we must recapture the spirit of determination that has allowed us to achieve so much already so that we may work together to defeat this scourge
8690518 despite our best efforts people do not feel safe and so many have been victims of crime that everyone feels like a victim
8690519 it is time to organise our people for struggle once again it is time to find one anothers humanity and the common aspirations which will forge alliances between strangers and between unlikely allies
8690520 it is time to rediscover the leadership strengths among the ordinary people of our country and to ask them to stand up and be counted
8690521 it undermines our ability to build a better life for what is a better life if it is not safe
8690522 we are working to build a united nation at peace with ourselves and the world and we cannot allow criminal violence to divert us from our path
8690523 the growth data are even better than many expected and again counter beliefs the economy was in recession in the first half of the year
8690524 t he momentum going into the third quarter is clearly greater and could result in a significant upward revision to 2008 real growth estimates
8690525 w e think it is too soon to turn optimistic as the economy faces important challenges in the months ahead most important weak consumer fundamentals will likely begin to assert themselves in the second half of the year as the stimulus from the income tax rebates begins to fade
8690526 the income side of the economy has expanded by only 0 3 over the last year in real terms while expenditure based real gdp is up 2 2 moreover the income estimate of gdp fell in both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year looking much more like a classic recession that we think began in december 2007

8690533 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
8690534 discussions are underway to resolve the matter until then the departing aircraft is subject to delay until further notice a later flight to vancouver flight z4375 is also delayed
8690535 have sought creditor protection by filing legal notices of intention to appoint an administrator in both the u k and canada
8690536 the airlines flights will continue to operate and the decision to instigate creditor protection proceedings means that the demands of existing creditors are frozen while we continue negotiations on an investment package which already are at an advanced stage
8690537 they certainly owe lots to the calgary airport authority and we understand to other airports across the country
8690538 the bank turned in a solid performance this quarter driven in particular by a strong contribution from the financial markets segment and good growth in business volumes at personal and commercial
8690539 if it goes anywhere near refineries thats going to knock out production for about a week
8690540 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8690541 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by five 10 15 cents a gallon
8690542 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 per cent
8690543 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8690544 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8690545 there is an interesting and worrying phenomenon that the commission and national regulators have identified
8690546 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this is a result of not charging by the second
8690547 a lot of operators resorted to billing whole minutes and not the exact amount of time the consumer uses
8690548 most operators did not change their billing system since the introduction of the roaming regulations
8690549 a difference that operators can use to attract consumers with different preferences
8690550 has received no official notification of any change in government attitude and is investigating
8690551 management believes that its agreements with the government of drc are legally binding that all associated issues have been dealt with fully under congolese law and that the overall fiscal terms previously negotiated and incorporated into the amended and restated mining convention exceed the requirements of the congolese mining code
8690552 weighing together likely slowdowns in export growth and consumer spending and the continued troubles in the banking and housing sectors forecasters expect gdp growth to slow to about 1 5 per cent in the third quarter and to near zero in the fourth
8690553 many people thought the sky was falling this spring but the economy actually expanded quite solidly
8690554 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8690555 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8690556 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8690557 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualized economic growth to recede to near 1 0 percent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8690558 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast
8690559 i think that some people are trying to figure out some bottoming process and they might have come in here and come in early or they may feel a trading stance is warranted
8690560 sometimes it just takes a lack of horrendous news to allow something to fall back up if you push a spring down hard enough it will snap back at you almost every time even one thats pretty rusty and old
8690561 weighing together likely slowdowns in export growth and consumer spending and the continued troubles in the banking and housing sectors forecasters expect gdp growth to slow to about 1 5 per cent in the third quarter and to near zero in the fourth
8690562 a sale to a chinese bank would provoke a very negative reaction from the government and public opinion

8690616 i have been given no reason to believe that there is any illegality i continue to watch closely developments on all matters around ministers but at this time i have no reason to doubt mr peters word
8690617 i want to see the matter dealt with obviously but as ive consistently said i feel ive got a duty to be fair i have not known mr peters to lie to me and i have to take people as i find them
8690618 i will be talking with winston peters directly that will most likely be tomorrow i understand that he has engaged legal counsel he will want to consult that counsel

8690638 it finally dawned on me that white baby boomers are the group that is really hurting barack obama
8690639 of all people the generation that brought us the vietnam war protests and the summer of love is proving to be a very tough nut for the presumptive democratic presidential nominee to crack
8690640 by doing very well among african americans and reasonably well among hispanics obama could easily overcome his deficits among whites under 50 and over 65 but losing whites born between 1944 and 1958 pretty much the lions share of the baby boomers by 18 percentage points wow thats a burden
8690641 i sometimes felt as if i were watching the psychodrama of the baby boom generation a tale rooted in old grudges and revenge plots hatched on a handful of college campuses long ago played out on the national stage

8690655 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8690656 i think what senator obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that we are on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8690657 can obama force americans to understand the gravity of our problems can he offer solutions

8690722 purges reservations data within seven days of guest departure thereby limiting potential data exposure
8690723 we got the warning from the antivirus software and after that we turned off the systems and changed the systems
8690724 we cut off our internet connection informed it and turned everything off immediately i dont know the details of the virus it was only 10 people who were affected the clients who were hacked have been informed
8690725 what i found was on one of the top underground forums for the rbn trading network

8690727 i have said to the captain and the coach what my feelings are and i dont really want to say them in public
8690728 at the end of the day i was looking more long term in the winter and getting ready for the test series
8690729 i didnt envisage coming back to play in this series which makes it awkward but that is a bit down the line if i am picked for that game there is not much i can do about it

8690734 both peter moores and kev told me to come back and play we need somebody we need a favour will you come and bowl
8690735 i said i would come and play until the end of the series and see what happens then and ive enjoyed it
8690736 the family reasons were not the only reason i packed in
8690737 it was one of the main reasons but it wasnt the whole thing
8690738 i packed it in for cricketing reasons i wasnt bowling very well and was not enjoying my cricket
8690739 the family thing didnt help but the family is a lot more stable now i have four kids and i dont envisage having any more
8690740 at the end of the day it is two months away but i would be two months away anyway because i would have to go to south africa and then on to play the test matches
8690741 i might as well do the bowling in the one day series and be a part of what ive missed
8690742 going away to south africa to play four day matches to get ready for the test match or playing one day cricket for england was really a no brainer

8690785 the man was called down and he was initially quite surprised when he was told the officials suspected him of carrying explosives he burst out laughing and opened his bag to reveal three bottles of honey to reassure the officials that he wasnt lying he drank about 10 from one bottle and also offered it to the officials however they declined to taste it and also refused to let the passenger carry the bottles with him
8690786 he tried arguing with the security staff but to no avail since the system showed the bottles contained explosives the officials were not willing to take a chance even though the passenger had proved that the bottles contained nothing but honey he got so furious that he even threatened to file a case against the management in singapore
8690787 a screener has about 20 seconds at one level to scan the image of the bag and decide if it can pass through or not there is an extremely small margin of error in this particular case there is also a strong chance that the screener did spot explosives but accidentally isolated the wrong bag
8690788 i was really pleased with the result but we were not at our best and could have played better
8690789 lords was an example of how we can play that was the highlight the place the occasion the way we played with both ball and bat we also had two batters caroline atkins and sarah taylor getting hundreds and nunny katherine brunt getting five for

8690797 these microdomains are so tiny you could fit five million on them on a full stop there are 10 000 receptors on each cell and we are able to follow how single drug molecules bind to individual receptors in these specialised microdomains
8690798 what makes this single molecule laser technique unique is that we are looking at them in real time on a living cell other techniques that investigate how drugs bind to their receptors require many millions of cells to get a big enough signal and this normally involves destroying the cells in the process
8690799 i made an early pledge not to accept contributions from developers and ive done my level best to keep that in all three elections that ive been through i think it s important that the public know we are doing their work not the work of any particular interest group

8690802 americans who worked so hard to reach the point that an individual be truly judged based on the content of his character not the color of his skin
8690803 as a caucasian female living in new york i never thought id see this day either
8690804 i am thrilled beyond belief that so many see and support the content of obamas character it is proof that we are finally putting the issue of color where it belongs behind us
8690805 i feel like im here basically standing on the shoulders of my ancestors
8690806 i never thought in my lifetime id see a black man be nominated for president of the united states

8690808 i am not a delegate just an obama supporter im here to witness and be a part of history
8690809 there is optimism in the air there is hope and celebration in everyones eyes
8690810 not since john kennedys presidency have i felt the hope and excitement of a new direction for this country that i feel obama brings
8690811 if he proves to be just another politician ill be hugely disappointed at this point in time i dont think he is
8690812 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8690813 recently approved pesticides have been implicated in massive bee die offs and are the focus of increasing scientific scrutiny
8690814 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
8690815 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem this isnt just an issue for farmers this is an issue that concerns us all just try to imagine a pizza without the contribution of bees no tomatoes no cheese no peppers if you eat apples cucumbers broccoli onions squash carrots avocados or cherries you need to be concerned
8690816 failure to follow the contract language weakens oversight of the contract and erodes city council control over city finances
8690817 about 6 incorporated towns have tax increment financing programs that were approved by the general assembly through town charter changes over the last 3 4 years many of the concerns you share have been expressed in the senate during debate
8690818 tax increment financed bonds or tifs are more expensive for local taxpayers than other options such as general obligation bonds or certificates of participation
8690819 a tif scheme will also allow local governments to hide the targeted tax incentive theyre providing to a private developer
8690820 its no surprise that these disadvantages make tifs extremely valuable to some government officials first tifs do not require voter approval second tifs divert tax revenue before it reaches the general fund that means the fiscal effect is hidden along with the tifs role as a taxpayer subsidy to private developers third the lack of voter approval and transparency help make tifs far more expensive than other forms of debt
8690821 this is simply not true and those who say it have confused costs with budget items it is true the government does not use general tax dollars to pay the debt tied to a tif thats because the revenue never makes it to the general fund in the first place this has no cost in the same way that having taxes deducted from your paycheck has no cost the moneyused to pay off the tif debt is not available for other needed services even in the special tif district itself a private development without tax increment financing would pay the same amount of taxes with all of the tax revenue available to pay for services instead of new debt tax breaks for individual developers and similarly targeted economic development incentives are never a good idea
8690822 hiding the incentives behind the veil of a tif can lull people into not recognizing the risks of a project are even worse
8690823 local governments need to be honest with taxpayers about the costs and risks involved in tifs and also about their use as targeted economic incentives
8690824 but for the tax increment financing program would this project still be accomplished and attain a satisfactoy result
8690825 ni las ca das ni los neum ticos han mermado mi confianza
8690826 un pilotaje mejor con m s confianza y mayor rendimiento
8690827 si no fuese por los problemas con las gomas quiz tendr a el cuarto puesto un poco m s asegurado pero tambi n hubo ca das y malos resultados as que pensar en la tercera plaza tambi n se antoja complicado
8690828 una pista menos cr tica que laguna seca y brno as que en principio deber amos estar m s cerca de los bridgestone
8690829 las pruebas en brno fueron bien para m y para mi pilotaje y para michelin porque probamos nuevas gomas que mejoraron el rendimiento si esos neum ticos nuevos van a funcionar aqu eso ya es otra historia
8690830 porque en las carreras siempre suceden cosas imprevistas me marco objetivos generales quedar entre los cinco primeros a final de a o pero no carrera a carrera
8690831 qui n sabe si en las seis carreras que quedan michelin empieza a rendir otra vez como al principio de la temporada para m l gicamente est bien as porque estoy muy contento con las prestaciones de los bridgestone
8690832 ser a demasiado arriesgado pensar en otros constructores como dunlop o pirelli en el caso de superbikes creo que para entrar en motogp hace falta m s experiencia quiz un a o al menos
8690833 que se decida por la capacidad del piloto o en todo caso por las marcas de las motos pero no por los neum ticos
8690834 creo que no habr m s incorporaciones durante la semana pasada tuvimos negociaciones con un club hicimos una oferta por un jugador neves la oferta no ha sido aceptada o atendida y la mantenemos porque la hemos hecho no s si se alcanzar un acuerdo o no en esta situaci n pero fuera de esta situaci n concreta trabajada y posible no vamos a iniciar nada m s
8690835 no s si est concretado eso el fichaje de neves por el hamburgo y habl hace un rato con el agente la situaci n de los jugadores que no son de clubes sino que son de inversores son especiales y muchas veces no sabes donde est s y esa es la situaci n de thiago
8690836 considero que con maniche y ver banega tenemos dos futbolistas que se acercan un poco a lo que quiere aguirre tambi n consideramos que la solicitud del entrenador que es l gica y que hemos intentado cubrir tampoco se puede cubrir a cualquier precio
8690837 si cualquier precio a adi supone pagar m s de lo que vale un futbolista o deshacer un equilibrio de los salarios del vestuario el club no va a sacrificar la estabilidad el equilibrio la convivencia y la buena relaci n club jugador o jugadores entre s
8690838 el club en ese aspecto est feliz de tener lo que tiene y me gustar a que en lugar de que la pregunta fuera si viene thiago neves o no me preguntarais si sigue simao o no si sigue kun o no o si sigue maxi o no
8690839 y la vamos teniendo vamos poco a poco y creo que el club est bien y tienes jugadores suficientes para cumplir los objetivos
8690840 el hecho de que ayer cuando termin el partido e iba andando hacia el coche hubiera mucha gente que me felicitaba lo primero o lo segundo
8690841 ayer hemos ganado al schalke por 4 0 el schalke es los ltimos a os el segundo club de alemania sin discusi n y el a o anterior fue el octavo club de europa estamos compitiendo en un nivel m s alto cada vez y la plantilla y el cuerpo t cnico nos est n dando lo que les estamos pidiendo que es el cumplimiento de los objetivos
8690842 no hay ninguna oferta formal hasta ahora del benfica por seitaridis es verdad que tanto maniche como l han estado en situaci n de transferibles pero quedan tres d as y ya todo viene un poco contracorriente
8690843 la salida de cualquier jugador ahora aunque fuera una operaci n econ micamente buena para el club supondr a probablemente un deterioro en el nivel deportivo del equipo l gicamente hay m s departamentos que tienen voz y voto en las decisiones no s lo el deportivo
8690844 pero yo soy director deportivo me alegra que los mejores futbolistas est n con nosotros y que los mejores futbolistas puedan venir a este club otra cosa es que la decisi n que es compartida pueda ser asumible acertada y conveniente en eso participamos m s gente
8690845 obedece a la posibilidad o no de venir un media punta
8690846 ver es un jugador que tiene m s manejo que puede ser un jugador m s parecido tambi n al perfil que ped a javier
8690847 tambi n porque es una alternativa m s parecida o m s pr xima a lo que maniche pueda dar que es mucho tambi n por esa situaci n pensamos no tener demasiada gente en medio y que cl ber tuviera un a o de tranquilidad un poco porque creo que hab is sido todos porque yo lo he defendido siempre un poco injustos con l y hab is trasladado a la gente una opini n negativa de un excelente futbolista
8690848 no tengo ninguna duda de que lo vamos a ver as en el mallorca y que no hay ninguna duda de esa opini n es que ha habido muchos clubes que lo han solicitado tanto en espa a como fuera de espa a y eso supondr que nos hemos equivocado con su fichaje o su elecci n muchos directores deportivos y muchos entrenadores

8690855 as a rookie youve got to put time in on the books study film come out on the practice field and give more than 100 percent every day learning is a big part of the game as a rookie
8690856 we feel that matt has earned this opportunity to start
8690857 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
8690858 matt is very astute hes picked up our system hes got a very good outlook about the game of football and a good understanding of how to play quarterback in the league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years it will be a great season for him to come in and be our leader
8690859 it is satisfying but trust me there is a lot of work ahead and i know that there are going to be ups and downs but ive got to stay mentally tough and grind through it im in a good situation with a lot of talented guys on offense and defense im excited to be part of that and to get the season going
8690860 from day one hes come in with the right attitude he hasnt done anything in a negative way hes worked hard knows what hes doing in the huddle and knows how to run the offense hes composed and confident in himself hes ready to go were ready for him to be the leader of this team
8690861 when you make plays especially as a young guy you just get more confidence
8690862 what i like about lowery is that hes a technician
8690863 he is a very methodical person he wants to know what the exact steps are then youre going to coach him on those steps and hes going to practice them during practice hes going to practice them after practice hes one of those guys thats going to rep it and train his body until he gets it right
8690864 the more you know the more you are going to be prepared the more confident you are and the more you can just go out and play
8690865 the more you study the more you see yourself doing something because you understand what is going on around you
8690866 and im going to take full advantage of it hopefully i can earn a spot on the team where i can be in the game at all times
8690867 hes a guy who can run inside and out and he can also catch the ball out of the backfield
8690868 hes very mature for his age very intelligent very instinctive and even keeled
8690869 hes got a tremendous amount of pride he does not like to make mistakes hes got a great focus about him hes picked up the offense very well when hes in there i dont have to worry about what i call i have confidence he knows what to do
8690870 from the first day he wanted the starting role and he embraced the challenge he has been very consistent in practice and done well in the games
8690871 they have it and he has it its been fun to watch him get better every day and he just brings it over to the game from practice which is hard for a rookie to do i just think hes going to be a special player in this league for a long time
8690872 im going to the reigning super bowl champions who have a great defense
8690873 they want me to come in and be a playmaker so im going to come in learn and im going to make a statement
8690874 what hes been doing in practice hes also showed in the games hes making good progress
8690875 hes been making some big plays and hopefully he continues to do that
8690876 i am just taking it one day at a time
8690877 youve got to respect the fact that the veterans have been here and they know the system the biggest thing in this league is experience these guys have played in the big games in the super bowl and i want to learn from that i want to take everything in that i can from them and listen to everything they tell me
8690878 one day im working with the twos and threes and the next day all of a sudden im working with the ones
8690879 he has a very low center of gravity so he doesnt take a lot of hits he mainly delivers a blow instead of taking one

8690898 i was a 29 year old kid running for the united states senate in 1972 there was somewhere between six and 10 busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down literally there were hundreds of thousands of people
8690899 barack obama couldve made that speech were he alive in 1972
8690900 by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8690901 you go into some of these small towns in pennsylvania and its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them as a way to explain their frustrations

8690908 as he tried to campaign for his wife i think in the heat of the campaign he made some verbal mistakes
8690909 i made plenty of them when i was running for president too so i dont blame him for it but i think in some of his remarks he has hurt his wifes candidacy
8690910 i would like also for obama to say since im interested in the middle east that from the beginning of my administration well begin to work for peace for israel and justice for the palestinians
8690911 whereas in the previous period the presidents have waited until the last year because its a very controversial issue
8690912 i think hes dramatically changed in the last few months
8690913 he was for the separation of church and state and now hes in bed with the right wing religious groups that might help him get elected as president
8690914 i dont now what hell do as president because we dont know which john mccain might be elected was it the one that existed in 2000 or in his previous history as a senator or is it the john mccain weve seen of the last few months as hes tried to reach out to the most radical and conservative elements of the republican party
8690915 hes been a member of the armed services committee working hand in hand with vice presidential nominee joe biden and with the great republican leaders as well
8690916 si todo va bien el rayo ser protagonista en segunda
8690917 es cierto que toda la familia rayista ha estado esperando a que llegara el s bado y lo vemos con mucha ilusi n pero con la tranquilidad de un trabajo cumplido que es el devolver al rayo a la segunda categor a del f tbol profesional y estar entre los mejores
8690918 creo que hemos hecho una pretemporada aceptable jugando contra equipos de primera y lo hemos hecho bien tenemos la ilusi n del primer partido si hubi ramos tenido que elegir un rival hubiera sido el murcia el partido lo tiene todo para ser una buena tarde de f tbol y para que la afici n disfrute de ella la liga en segunda es muy larga y no tiene mucha incidencia lo que ocurre en los primeros meses hay que ir con tranquilidad trabajar duro e intentar hacerlo lo mejor posible
8690919 s pero es as todos los a os recuerdo hace mucho cuando yo debut como entrenador en segunda estaba el sevilla el betis y el atl tico de madrid todos los a os siempre hay dificultades todos los a os hay favoritos y luego todos los a os hay sorpresas nosotros lo que queremos es que si podemos ser la sorpresa mejor pero sobre todo disfrutar del f tbol profesional y a un buen nivel
8690920 vamos a intentar hacer lo mismo que hemos hecho estos a os atr s este ser mi tercer a o en el club hemos sido campeones de segunda b hemos ascendido y todo lo basamos en el bal n por ello no tenemos que cambiar nuestras se as de identidad si las cambi ramos ahora nos equivocar amos nuestra candidatura este a o no es con la idea de ascender sino simplemente hacer buen f tbol y disfrutar de ello
8690921 venimos de una semana en holanda en la que hemos jugado contra dos equipos de la primera de all lo hemos hecho muy bien y no tenemos miedo a ning n equipo lo que queremos es cuanto antes coger nuestra forma de jugar y ser nosotros mismos
8690922 si hay alg n equipo que se quiera llevar a alg n jugador de los que est n aqu tendr que pagar y a tres d as de empezar la competici n mucho m s nosotros no cerramos la puerta a nadie porque somos un club humilde pero lo que s que est claro es que vamos a defender los derechos del rayo
8690923 lo de cobe o es obvio y notorio que el getafe lo quiere pero de jes s perera no ten a ninguna noticia
8690924 es una mezcla buena y si sabemos hacerlo bien podemos ser un equipo competitivo en el f tbol es importante tener hambre por conseguir cosas y la gente joven aporta esa ilusi n por hacerlo bien por hacerse un hueco en el f tbol profesional
8690925 s seguro que s todas las plantillas son mejorables y la nuestra tambi n si encontramos algo que nos mejora en alguna parcela lo haremos sin ninguna duda
8690926 estamos intentando buscar un jugador de banda espec fico en la izquierda es curioso porque hay m s de diez zurdos en la plantilla pero ninguno espec fico de banda
8690927 el a o pasado basamos el ser campeones y el ascender en solo perder tres partidos en casa y en ser fuertes fuera este a o ser diferente pero lo que s que es cierto es que los partidos en casa son vitales si queremos ser un equipo protagonista tambi n hay que serlo fuera de aqu pero lo que interesa es jugar todos los partidos con la misma intensidad
8690928 es normal es humano todos queremos lo mejor somos parte de este barrio y de esta gente que ha sufrido con nosotros durante cuatro a os pero nuestro objetivo a d a de hoy es ganarle al murcia m s all de eso no existe nada la liga es muy larga y en abril veremos si estamos entre los siete primeros lucharemos por el ascenso pero si no iremos paso a paso y sin cometer las equivocaciones que se cometieron hace cinco a os y que llevaron al equipo al descenso
8690929 llevo muchos partidos en segunda con diferentes equipos y los favoritos al comienzo de la jornada suelen ser distintos a los de los ltimos partidos el rayo puede estar entre ellos sin ning n problema pero nuestro objetivo vuelvo a decir que es ganarle al murcia
8690930 estabilidad y tranquilidad para trabajar y hacer las cosas bien demostramos el a o pasado que si estamos tranquilos las cosas salen esperemos que todo vaya normal y si es as el rayo ser protagonista en segunda divisi n
8690931 i spend one third of my time thinking about what i am going to say and two thirds of my time thinking about what he is going to say
8690932 so it seems like there are really three different issues going on here which are
8690933 yes we think its well above the industry average in fact last year we lost 20 of the sales force
8690934 well some of it was uncontrollable attrition like retirements but
8690935 i know what you mean two years ago i also missed a major family event due to a deadline at work
8690936 what would it take to get alignment around this issue
8690937 so andrew why do you want more subscribers maybe you should have fewer
8690938 basically we want our relationship managers to up their game and stop playing politics
8690939 if this project succeeds what would things look like a year from now
8690940 i dont know your company well enough to answer that
8690941 let me make sure i understand your question are you asking if its a good idea or if its feasible
8690942 is there anything i havent asked about that you think is relevant
8690943 so youve demonstrated that our costs are 20 over the benchmark i just dont believe that
8690944 oh come on weve known this for years thats why our operating margins are so bad
8690945 it is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed

8690949 what cause could the police have to come into a community center like the long haul and seize information belonging to the people of berkeley they must return our property immediately
8690950 it became apparent to me as a capitalist that if i lent myself to this sort of action by his fellow businessmen and resisted any change designed to benefit all the people i could be consumed by the poisons of social lag i had helped to create
8690951 ojal que podamos aportar al equipo lo que necesita y sacar un resultado positivo a n no sabemos c mo vamos a jugar ni qui nes van a hacerlo pero lo importante es que tenemos variantes en caso de que me toque ser titular podr a adaptarme a cualquier sitio
8690952 y dejar a joseba llorente como nica referencia en el ataque creo que somos compatibles
8690953 en los ltimos partidos no hemos marcado goles y es normal que estemos un poco preocupados espero que los malos resultados de la pretemporada sean un toque de atenci n importante el equipo est unido y no debemos desesperarnos
8690954 cuando sali el schalke est bamos asustados un poco y mira c mo ha salido despu s del primer partido est bamos m s asustados todav a con lo que ayer se diera ese resultado 4 0 nos hace felices y nos da confianza en lo que estamos haciendo todos
8690955 el atleti supone tambi n un impacto por lo menos tan grande como otros clubes suponen para nosotros en el sorteo de la previa todos los equipos del bombo 1 ten an p nico a que le tocara en el grupo 2 el atl tico eso va a pasar despu s de la forma brillante que hemos pasado ayer
8690956 nosotros a adi tenemos tanta ilusi n con esto es un juguete nuevo despu s de un d a de reyes que no te dir que nos da igual cualquier rival pero tambi n nos hace ilusi n jugar en grandes estadios contra grandes equipos y mostrar cu les son nuestras credenciales que son los 23 futbolistas de la plantilla que tienen un excelente nivel y que nos van a ayudar a cumplir los objetivos
8690957 quiero agradecer su colaboraci n a jurado ze castro reyes cl ber santana motta abbiati ismael falc n mista y fabiano eller o bien han estado esta pretemporada o nos ayudaron la temporada pasada a estar hoy en una situaci n inmejorable

8690968 and all of them face devotees with mudras of protection and blessing but hanuman is different he faces his devotees with bent head folded hand humility a politician does that non stop during election time when the fierce battle with ravana was on rama and lakshmana fell unconscious to a missile of inderjit hanuman air dashed and brought the herbal mountain that gave life to the slain soldiers of rama likewise during a hard fought electoral battle a politician brings back dead voters to life in polling booths
8690969 and when his long tail was set on fire in lanka did the wronged emissary hanuman keep quiet no vayus son flew every which way and set fire to the whole of lanka mind you if you as much as touch me what follows the cars burn buses burn shops burn everything burns
8690970 its clear that the second quarter not only wasnt a recession quarter it was actually a very robust quarter

8690987 siempre doy la alineaci n el d a del partido primero a los jugadores
8690988 es uno de los pocos equipos aun jugando como visitantes en que tienen en cada cruce a cuatro jugadores en el rea rival
8690989 la mayor a nos dar a nosotros como favoritos pero eso no cuenta para nuestra preparaci n
8690990 el empate no nos deja satisfechos a ninguno de los dos equipos pero s rescato la actitud del equipo que nunca baj los brazos y en ese ir a matar o morir no perdi el orden
8690991 no se jug con mala intenci n fue un partido fuerte con una cancha muy r pida blanda y eso hace que haya un poco m s de fricciones no se percibi mala intenci n
8690992 fue monumental el trabajo de memo tuvimos tres opciones muy claras de gol pero el portero estuvo soberbio
8690993 ahora dejamos atr s el ltimo partido y ahora hay que pensar lo que viene ante pumas que ser un encuentro muy dif cil en el que los jugadores tendr n que tener la misma actitud
8690994 la verdad es que nadie de los primeros diez clasificados en mi divisi n quiere pelear conmigo
8690995 yo so aba con que la primera defensa de mi t tulo se diera en puerto rico que pudiera pelear ante mi gente y as ser el 4 de octubre regreso a puerto rico ahora como campe n mundial a defender mi t tulo en mi casa me siento bien contento con eso

8691001 tenemos un partido muy importante el domingo y tenemos que salir a ganar a como de lugar y aprovechar la jornada doble que es muy importante en acumular puntos
8691002 nos falta m s aplicaci n m s entrega pero tenemos que seguir trabajando por que tenemos el partido ante pumas que ser un rival muy complicado
8691003 nos hace falta m s contundencia se juega bien pero no llegan los triunfos debemos estar tranquilos y lo nico que queda es aprovechar las oportunidades de gol y manejar bien los partidos

8691067 it is you can hardly go anywhere in st paul that you dont see someone you know which is the great thing about it i think
8691068 if you were one of these guys when you got to town youd literally walk up to the first police officer you saw and introduce yourself

8691072 that gave the party control of the house after 40 years in the minority
8691073 when it comes to the issue of fiscal responsibility id be the first to admit that i think some of my colleagues lost their way
8691074 getting our party to stand on principle is a critical part of what we have to do in order to earn our way back
8691075 the republicans difficulty is they have a small government philosophy and they use the rhetoric of limited government but when they become the majority party its very difficult to hold to that philosophy
8691076 there are going to be contentions between the social conservatives and the libertarian wings of the party and between the fiscal conservative and economic growth wings of the party

8691103 the largest online retailers dont ship all orders from one central warehouse they diversify inventory globally across multiple warehouses and ship orders from the warehouse closest to the end customer shipwire allows e tailers of any size to plug into this kind of global warehouse network starting at 30 a month
8691104 we knew our products would sell well in canada we didnt want to miss the fall riding season and certainly couldnt miss the 2008 holiday sales season we worked with shipwire to get inventory moved into canada when we launched a customized canadian site for our off road body armor and protective outerwear from idea to production in less than two months we are now selling to dealers and direct to consumers in canada as though we were local

8691110 the german champion eisb ren berlin has already received a request to join the khl in the future
8691111 there is a lot of money in the khl and we must all that take seriously
8691112 only if several german clubs participate in a group with duesseldorf berlin mannheim and perhaps moscow and prague
8691113 for the foreseeable future they can pay very different salaries

8691127 you have got people encouraged to buy a block of land way out of the city and they are having to travel for three hours a day to commute thats not sustainable
8691128 people there live in town houses or terrace houses the houses are never one storey and you have got the population that lives closer to the city
8691129 we have to curtail land subdivisions at the extremities of the city the other option is to put in some very fast trains to regional centres somewhere like geelong could be an attractive destination for working and living
8691130 the population is still growing and theres a demand for these properties
8691131 its near impossible to dictate to the market what should happen the thing thats keeping victorias economy very competitive compared to the mining states is we are very competitive in housing
8691132 there was a young man who went by the name of jack everyday he attended his daily chores like going to media rounds doing extensive media mapping effectively sending out extremely simple reports in the approved rocket science formats etc one fine day he thought that client goddess has finally seen all his sincerity and hard work and she herself called him up and told him exactly what he expected with his trembling hands he held on to the phone his heart filled with delight and glee on listening to the beautiful sound in which goddess said wow now thats a front page story she explained how she expected more out of him but still ready to relieve the pressure so that he wouldnt have to work like an ass to gain her blessings she gave him a story idea which would work like magic with his journalist comrades soon to be enemies he would be able to get front page stories and play with toys and would be pioneer a statesman in his contemporary dna age
8691133 name not published on request we are coming up with this new thing and its very environment friendly it would aim to teach students as well yes i do admit that other corporate have also moved in this stride but weve observed they have involved less no of students and we are involving many more i understand the idea is not new but we plan to invest in this for five years so we want good coverage around this
8691134 oh that sounds of wonderful without realizing it my boss has given a new meaning to the word wonderful i dont think we should have a problem in implementing a strategized plan on this although this is not a new idea no stone is left unturned in terms of csr ideas well still be able to derive some coverage out of it why isnt it saurabh
8691135 this is john brumbys fall back plan because of his failure to transfer freight to rail as labor promised
8691136 wed be very disappointed if any of this plan was put in place
8691137 the challenge weve got is the freight task in victoria is going to more than double by 2030 so theres going to be a lot more goods being moved and weve got to look at the most efficient way of moving them
8691138 with b triples if it means less trucks on the road and fewer trucks in local roads thatd be a good thing

8691142 why are you hammering on that fence it already has plenty of nails in it
8691143 that announcement made my head spin iron man isnt dark iron man worked because favreau brought in all the best iron man creators and had them read the script and asked them tell me what we did wrong and it worked because it had all the best things about iron man boiled down into the best movie they could make the dark knight was really good because it had all the best things about batman boiled down into the best movie they could make making a dark and gritty superman movie because dark knight made a ton of money is incredibly stupid
8691144 you always have to always keep superman very distinct from batman
8691145 batman can be brooding and bleak and dark but superman if you want to take a realistic approach to him thats fine but i dont think you can turn him into an angry character superman is about the hope in people the good in people whereas batman is about the more driven hungry for justice angry side of us so i dont know if doing a dark superman is the approach but im all for a reboot
8691146 make the films as dark as the characters allow us to go
8691147 hopefully they realize that superman is not a dark character but that doesnt mean the story cant be darker or more threatening
8691148 they can be a great people kal el they wish to be they only lack the light to show the way for this reason above all their capacity for good i have sent them you my only son

8691158 there is reason to believe that hoyo maru is leaking from her bunker which means there could be a lot more oil left to spill were hoping that japanese historians can help us to determine if she went down with a full tank so we can estimate the full scale of the threat
8691159 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8691160 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8691161 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8691162 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure

8691171 also romney strategically helps as far as the states of michigan and the mountain states like colorado new mexico and nevada that have been viewed in play as well
8691172 all the mccain folks need to say is look what the alternative will be and that will scare up the base

8691181 within our culture theres a correlation between the word planet and important i dont understand that
8691182 to me the coolest thing in the solar system is the kuiper belt
8691183 its like theres an implicit hierarchy if you are a planet you are first class a list you get inside the rope to the club and otherwise youre nothing
8691184 as we were leaving he looked at us very sadly and said
8691185 some people like to demote heroes and my dad was a hero
8691186 suddenly people were saying lets take the name off of the school that is named for him and lets take the street names off of the streets that are named for him
8691187 we live on a planet and therefore people identify much more closely with planets than they identify with a black hole or a star or whatever
8691188 knowing where the planets were affected your life if you believed that stuff people for historical reasons have assigned an unrealistic importance to those objects and not to objects that are not planets
8691189 that would make arlen specter chairman of the judiciary committee and mitch mcconnell majority leader likely resulting in the confirmation of four pending appeals court nominees to the all important fourth and d c circuits senate democrats would be unwilling to risk the fate of tom daschle by filibustering nominees so close to an election

8691239 we are working hard to iron out glitches before it goes out to users this is not about security issues
8691240 the enormous size of the database and the huge number of probable users inevitably increase the risks of accidental or inadvertent breaches of security and of deliberate misuse of the data which would be likely to bring the whole scheme into disrepute
8691241 this looks like further evidence of the chaos at the heart of government we repeatedly warned the government of the problems with contactpoint but they pressed ahead regardless ignoring our calls to allow time to sort them out
8691242 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems ministers now need to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk
8691243 when i was doing shows and flying economy and no one ever fed me or id be staying in hotels so cheap that by the time id get in there wasnt any room service i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad good or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it you go to a show and theres not food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it i never liked being that skinny i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny i was never bony bony but i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny

8691260 this is an exciting day for hockey fans in alberta and throughout canada
8691261 the bid group from alberta put forward a great plan and the site selection committee was particularly impressed with the bids focus on making tickets affordable for all hockey fans we had two outstanding bids to consider and both groups would have been great hosts of the 2012 iihf world junior championship today after completing the selection process we feel that alberta will present an event that will make all canadians proud
8691262 a joint calgary edmonton bid is a natural choice when it comes to the world junior championship
8691263 both markets are home to model junior franchises and some of the best junior hockey fans in the country
8691264 we are thrilled to have partnered with edmonton and won the bid to host this prestigious event
8691265 the world junior hockey championship is truly a canadian tradition and a tremendous event that we anticipate will bring significant benefit to the province of alberta the tourism industry and the hockey community
8691266 calgary and edmonton have outstanding reputations for hosting international sport events and we expect the 2012 world junior championship to enjoy tremendous success
8691267 this is a premier international event and will be a great opportunity for all of alberta to see the best young hockey players in the world compete for their countries

8691271 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8691272 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8691273 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8691399 not for me personally i spent years and years and years studying intensely carefully putting a lot of time and energy and work into it i therefore am convinced i know a lot even if i dont i think i do so i run into someone who makes generally speaking a dismissive remark which shows that he has not put in anywhere near the time energy and effort and study i have and i turn into an arrogant pompous asshole so id rather not do that thats why i just stay loose on it

8691401 theres nothing mysterious about it hes not working at all hes playing or else hes forgotten all about us thats the kind of god you people talk about a country bumpkin a clumsy bungling brainless conceited uncouth hayseed good god how much reverence can you have for a supreme being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in his divine system of creation what in the world was running through that warped evil scatalogical mind of his when he robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements why in the world did he ever create pain

8691416 sound transit has worked with mercer island and with developers and construction project staff to remind construction crews that the garage facility is for transit users and that construction workers should not park there to access their sites

8691421 sound transit is telling us they are on schedule and we have no reason to doubt them
8691422 it basically comes down to how frequently theyre having symptoms and how much the symptoms are affecting their life
8691423 avoiding caffeine eliminating fatty or acidic foods losing excess weight and quitting smoking are all things patients can do to control their acid reflux
8691424 if people are having symptoms on a daily basis or more than three times a week we usually recommend they start medication
8691425 most patients suffering from mild acid reflux will treat themselves with over the counter medications
8691426 antacids are better for immediate relief like after a big meal because their effectiveness is short lived in nature and only lasts for as long as its in the system
8691427 you should see a doctor if your symptoms are not controlled by over the counter medicines because it could be a sign of a more serious condition
8691428 carafate is a liquid suspension that essentially coats the inside of the esophagus its short lived in its effectiveness because once the coating wears off its not going to do much
8691429 we really only prescribe it for people who have symptoms less than a couple times a week or month
8691430 h 2 receptor blockers work by shutting off the production of acid in the stomach
8691431 they are effective for mild reflux theyre relatively inexpensive and can be used casually by people who only have symptoms a couple times a month
8691432 the standard of care for treating gerd and related digestive diseases has become proton pump inhibitors and because they are so safe these are the most common medicines
8691433 gerd can cause a narrowing of the esophagus that leads to trouble swallowing
8691434 and in some patients it causes a change in the lining of the esophagus called barretts esophagus a condition that can lead to cancer

8691479 were committed to making google apps premier edition a service on which your organization can depend during the first half of august we didnt do this as well as we should have
8691480 more importantly we promise you focused discipline on preventing recurrence of the same problem
8691481 typically the problem with call recording is not so much to record a call
8691482 but how do you find the recording of a call that took place on tuesday afternoon three and a half months down the line
8691483 those are the things we have answered by using our call accounting product as a front end
8691484 because call accounting actually deals with finding calls and we make it very easy
8691485 one of our call accounting clients is the va hospital system
8691486 they make on the order of 300 000 to 500 000 calls a day

8691490 churn has been endemically high in this industry but its how the carriers work as they almost push them to leaving than trying to keep them
8691491 theyve all had a hard time trying to understand their customers or doing a good job of communication with them
8691492 we seek to provide the kind of service whether thats network coverage products and services or customer service that not only satisfies customers but also makes them likely to recommend us to a family member friend or colleague

8691494 its become a significant issue as they realized they were losing as many customers as they were signing on and realized theyd have to stem that loss flow

8691509 and a lot of those folks go back with me to 2000 when i was the dnc chair we discussed ways to legally help the pennsylvania and ohio democratic parties to strengthen the parties which will strengthen their abilities to get what is called a coordinated campaign going to do things like registration and turnout to direct money to the parties to do that which helps us in our state reps race it helps us in our state senate race and helps us in our congressional race and it also helps us in presidentials
8691510 that money cannot be used by candidates it cannot be used by candidates it cannot be used for television it has to be used for what are called party building activities but party building activities help the guy running for state rep they also help the guy running for president
8691511 of course our state laws in pennsylvania and ohio are much more liberal than federal laws with less limitations
8691512 these are friends that governor rendell and i have had over the years and obviously are interested in ohio
8691513 it was an effort to communicate what we think we must do in ohio and pennsylvania to have a chance of winning
8691514 it would look as if we are ahead now and we have a lot of tools going forth
8691515 there was a lot of emphasis today on the amount of organization on the ground
8691516 republicans cant win the election without ohio and were focusing on that
8691517 there is a lot of confidence being expressed now by both the governors and the people doing the fund raising this is the time that everyone wants to go out and do it there are joint state parties that are non federal and the governors are making that point there are issues here that can be made available vehicles for people who are maxed out but we shouldnt think of being only donors there are a lot of people in this country who are not maxed out and organizing them is extremely important and im focused on that
8691518 while accy had been profitable for the four consecutive quarters prior to 1q08 a year over year decline in gross profit of 82 declining revenue and obscene operating expenses contributed to the companys 1 9 million net loss this quarter a huge swing from the companys 532 549 net income in same period of 2007
8691519 with no guidance on future revenue by the company it has become very difficult for us to remain optimistic about accys future revenue growth by and large we are seeing slimmer chances of the company meeting the two conditions necessary for its survival exponential growth in revenue and procurement of additional funding
8691520 we no longer accept accy as a going concern the company has been unable to make payments to its lenders and although accy is working to restructure its debt at least one lender has announced that it will commence collection efforts to include foreclosure on assets securing the debenture we are issuing a sell recommendation and believe the stock offers an unattractive risk reward profile at this time
8691521 the 2 percent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries

8691534 the board does not believe the dseis is adequate because it does not fully evaluate the impacts to the presidios national historic landmark district

8691572 we literally have lakefront property right now about 30 feet from our houses and were in a no flood zone

8691579 we now know that the higgs boson does not have a mass of 170gev c2 if it did have this mass then we should have seen evidence for it at the tevatron by now ruling out possible masses of the higgs is a very important part of the hunt for this elusive particle
8691580 the observation of the very rare zz process is a real stepping stone to the higgs following this with the first direct higgs mass exclusion since 2000 is tremendously exciting
8691581 it shows that the tevatron experiments are very much in the race for finding the higgs
8691582 cluster allowed us to measure the gradient of the magnetic field and see how it was changing direction with time
8691583 we are beginning to realise just how many interactions can take place between the solar wind and the atmosphere

8691585 fear of legal problems is one of the main reasons why smes are slow to launch internet based services from e commerce to online marketing
8691586 it is vital for smes to know what regulations apply to which country to respect them and then to adjust their cash flow to reflect their obligations
8691587 web 2 0 refers to the sharing collaboration and interactivity typical in many of the most successful online services that have launched in recent years
8691588 we didnt use the wikipedia software which is also open source because any users can post information
8691589 we check contributors manually using our panel of experts around europe to establish that the contributor has a sufficient level of expertise to write an article on internet law
8691590 most of the contributors come from universities or law firms who want to raise their profile
8691591 the choice of contributors was deliberate because were hoping to keep the service as low cost as possible so it will remain sustainable
8691592 we are building a critical mass of users and contributors around the world and we hope the service will continue to track the rapid change in online law
8691593 our research revealed that people like to shoot video with their point and shoot cameras but were very dissatisfied with the video quality and the resulting large files

8691595 when blood cholesterol was measured at both six weeks and twelve weeks both groups showed either no change or a reduction particularly in their ldl bad cholesterol levels despite the egg group increasing their dietary cholesterol intake to around four times that of the control
8691596 there is no convincing evidence to link an increased intake of dietary cholesterol or eggs with coronary heart disease through raised blood cholesterol indeed eggs make a nutritional contribution to a healthy calorie restricted diet we have shown that when two eggs a day are eaten by people who are actively losing weight on a calorie restricted diet blood cholesterol can still be reduced
8691597 its a matter of what the attacker can get to and in what order
8691598 if you spend time patching vulnerabilities the attacker cant get to first
8691599 instead of patching or fixing or blocking a thousand hosts
8691600 we could say there are 10 critical hosts and patch those first
8691601 the idea is that if things were going well for a party mps are cohesive they all agree with each other and stick together but if things are going badly for a party they start disagreeing and have different opinions so factions appear unsurprisingly the period following the election is marked by all three parties showing a considerable level of fluctuation in their cohesiveness as if in some disarray
8691602 the information gained from looking at early day motions can really provide an insight into many aspects of political life does your mp really agree with party principles or are they secretly more in tune one of the other parties what are the issues that are causing your party trouble and strife what is the overall mood of the party at any one point in time just before an important vote for example

8691605 i came across two little black marsh fly puparia and kept them in jam jars on my desk expecting that adult marsh flies might hatch but what emerged were two different species of parasitic wasp
8691606 when we finally discovered that one of these insects had never been recorded before the question then was what to call this creature
8691607 after resisting the temptation to name it after someone i know who really wants to be named after a parasite we settled on naming it mesoleptus hibernica in honour of the country where it was discovered
8691608 nectar which was thought to be natures soft drink may not be so soft after all
8691609 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8691610 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
8691611 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
8691612 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
8691613 this is an exciting new method that will help us understand the timescales of fundamental volcanic processes driving eruptions
8691614 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8691615 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8691616 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests
8691617 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8691618 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8691619 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8691620 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8691621 it may be a function of social perceptions of alcohol in that particular region
8691622 it has had a very negative impact on our day to day life
8691623 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon
8691624 only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8691625 some of the practices that these folks hammered may provide alternative forms of understanding how to do low level sustainable development today
8691626 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8691627 if you find it in europe its a city if you find it somewhere else it has to be something else
8691628 they have quite remarkable planning and self organization more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8691629 this throws a wrench in all the models suggesting we are looking at primordial biodiversity
8691630 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists
8691631 but we found a way to take a c f bond that you can do very little with and break it and convert it cleanly into something else at room temperature
8691632 conversion of pfcs remains a challenge and our research efforts are directed at designing even more active catalysts capable of pfc activation
8691633 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8691634 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8691635 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8691636 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8691637 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8691638 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8691639 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers

8691664 as the president of regis university in denver colorado i am especially aware of the damage done by degree mills like st regis which has injured the reputation of my school founded in 1877 the real regis has 15 000 students seeking legitimate degrees at our american campuses and online in contrast st regis was a fraud masquerading as a legitimate school it is important that potential students regulators and employers differentiate between the legitimate institutions of higher learning and the criminals who cheat the public by using names that trade on the good reputation of real schools
8691665 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8691666 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8691667 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8691668 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need

8691681 i could be doing so much more with my life with that in mind im going to come up with my own list of things i want to accomplish before i die and set out to achieve them sometimes you just gotta live like you were dying

8691918 we face strong competition from other employers and our personnel are very much in demand owing to the skills and experience they acquire during service life
8691919 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8691920 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try to help people who are hurt through this
8691921 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
8691922 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8691923 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8691924 finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
8691925 the post world war ii international architecture is not very robust and the russians are counting on that

8691930 what i know is that negotiations are ongoing and that is about it we have agreed a fee but nothing has been signed yet
8691931 he is going to be a big loss for this club he has been fantastic here at mk and it is a bit of a shame but it is the players wish and dream and we wish him good luck
8691932 it is going to take time to see how much hell be missed here and obviously you know the transfer window closes in a few days so there is not much time left
8691933 but i guess the chairman will be happy he has got a richer bank account and we will see what we can do
8691934 he is now doing a lot of things i was asking him to like being much more aggressive and stop hitting so many damn drop shots stop playing what i call possum tennis he likes to get on the ropes but he is the kind of fighter who has the capability to get into the centre of the ring and throw blows
8691935 for a young guy he appears to be older than he is because he is very driven and is pretty reserved he doesnt live an outlandish life and he has gotta be the only scottish guy ever who doesnt drink his idea of a great time is studying his opponents play on dvds and then he plays video games seven hours a day so if he is not playing video games or playing tennis he is with his girlfriend he lives a quiet relaxed life focused on being a tennis player but he is obsessed with video games
8691936 nor am i willing to accept a reading of the bible that considers an obscure line in romans to be more defining of christianity than the sermon on the mount
8691937 in the ultimate value of this brief life weve each been given
8691938 i explained my belief that few women made a decision to terminate a pregnancy casually that any pregnant woman felt the full force of the moral issues involved and wrestled with her conscience when making that heart wrenching decision
8691939 i wondered whether i should have told her the truth that i wasnt sure what happens when we die any more than i was sure of where the soul resides or what existed before the big bang

8691953 la nouvelle saison europ enne de football de clubs fait suite un championnat deurope tr s r ussi o lesprit du respect et du fair play sest distingu sur le terrain comme en dehors cest pourquoi jaimerais saisir cette opportunit pour demander tous les clubs joueurs et officiels de maintenir le m me esprit cette saison la campagne respect inclut le respect des adversaires des arbitres officiels et supporteurs et elle sera men e dans lensemble des comp titions europ ennes de luefa
8691954 il sagit dun d veloppement une plus grande chelle de la philosophie fair play adopt e par luefa ces derni res ann es
8691955 le respect couvre tout ce dont le football doit se pr occuper le respect de ladversaire des lois du jeu des officiels et entre supporteurs dune mani re plus g n rale le respect est une valeur que luefa en tant quinstitution ainsi que ses employ s doivent adopter envers toutes les personnes quelles sont amen es rencontrer
8691956 nous d veloppons des initiatives sp cifiques pour faire sortir cette campagne de terre
8691957 nous avons d but ce travail juste avant leuro et le message diffus dans les premiers temps semble bien passer cest ce qui ressort des commentaires de diff rentes sources et jai pu voir de mes propres yeux que les probl mes li s aux simulations aux tricheries et aux contestations des d cisions arbitrales ont t beaucoup beaucoup moins nombreux luefa euro 2008 que par le pass bien s r le plus important est de poursuivre sur la m me voie dans nos comp titions de clubs afin de voir le m me comportement exemplaire de la part des supporteurs des joueurs des entra neurs et des officiels tout au long de la saison
8691958 remporter ce troph e est un grand honneur et un grand plaisir pour moi
8691959 bien s r que c tait difficile parce que tout d pendait de moi et des cinq tireurs mais jai essay de me rappeler des vid os que javais visionn es et des propos chang s avec dautres gardiens cest ce qui mest venu lesprit
8691960 jai jou ce fameux match dil y a neuf ans et avant le coup denvoi nous navons probablement pas r alis son importance
8691961 cest un norme d fi que de remporter la comp tition chaque saison mais la composition de l quipe et les joueurs que nous avons nous font que nous sommes impr visibles en attaque
8691962 pour moi au vu de la saison derni re c tait la seule diff rence nous avions tant de joueurs capables de modifier le cours des matches devant
8691963 nous avons une jeune quipe et il ny a pas de raison de ne pas y arriver le fait de gagner le championnat et la ligue des champions nous propulse dans des comp titions comme celle l et nous en attendons beaucoup notre intention est toujours de gagner et pour y parvenir nous devons bien jouer collectivement nous avons fait preuve de consistance sur ce plan ces deux derni res saisons et il nous faut continuer cette ann e si nous restons performants il ny a aucune raison de ne pas r ussir
8691964 there are certain stories that dont end the way that they end in the book its not really family stuff its more like well theres a bit in the book about demi moore and i dancing on the bar
8691965 shes dancing up on me and humping me from behind the one part thats not in the book is that she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
8691966 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me
8691967 it was hysterical there are no pictures of it but it actually happened the lawyers didnt think it was wise for me to print that so theres your juicy tidbit
8691968 my parents taught us to live our faith and to treasure our families we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they just try hard enough
8691969 thats how you come to believe to the very core of your being that work is more than a paycheck its dignity its respect its about whether or not you can look your children in the eye and say were going to be all right
8691970 you can look your children in the eye and say were going to be all right
8691971 on ma demand r cemment si m ferguson est le meilleur deurope mon avis il est le meilleur du monde
8691972 quand vous parvenez travailler pendant 22 ans dans un club comme manchester united en r sistant toutes les pressions cest que vous devez avoir une qualit exceptionnelle et cest le cas de ferguson jai beaucoup de respect pour lui et son quipe
8691973 avoir une telle facult dadaptation pour aller de glasgow saint p tersbourg
8691974 nous sommes tr s fiers d tre les vainqueurs de la coupe uefa et fiers de pouvoir d fier une quipe comme manchester united esp rons que ce ne sera pas la premi re et la derni re fois
8691975 la super coupe ne met aucune pression sur lune ou lautre quipe
8691976 elle a beau tre prestigieuse elle fournit dabord loccasion aux joueurs de se montrer et de se r galer le jeu offensif du zenit a capt lattention de beaucoup de monde la saison derni re donc il faut esp rer que ce sera un match vraiment captivant et tourn vers lattaque et je pense que ce sera le cas beaucoup de gens nous donnent favoris mais ce pronostic ne change en rien notre pr paration
8691977 la derni re fois que je suis venu ici jai align une quipe amoindrie
8691978 quand jai vu la lazio faire la f te je me suis jur que cela ne se reproduirait plus ils ont f t leur victoire comme sils avaient gagn la coupe du monde nous alignerons une quipe beaucoup plus forte cette fois ci
8691979 we congratulate stu on an outstanding playing career and we are very excited that he will now join our coaching staff
8691980 stu was a consummate professional on and off the ice throughout his career and was the type of player who always exhibited the qualities you would associate with a future coach stu will be an excellent addition to our staff which we feel is among the best in the league rick wilson has played a major role in building the stars franchise into the perennial contender that it is today we believe mark lamb is one of the top young assistants in the game and a major asset to our organization
8691981 i was truly fortunate to play as long as i did and i knew this was the time for me to wrap up my playing days
8691982 a great opportunity to become an assistant coach was presented to me by the stars and i look forward to making that transition and learning a new part of the game

8691998 this has led directly to a similarly significant increase in monetizable partner inventory as our video id partners are seeing claimed content more than double their number of views against which we can run ads
8691999 this means that if a partner has say 10 000 views of its content leaving up videos claimed by our system will lead to an average additional 10 000 views of that same content we call this partner uplift and for some partners weve seen uplift as high as 9000

8692013 in the past two years anti retroviral drugs have become available for free meaning some hiv positive people previously unknown to the authorities are now being reported
8692014 in the philippines the low partner exchange the frequency or the number of male clients of prostitutes frequenting other partners the contributory factor of circumcision those are some of the conditions that have somehow kept the hiv prevalence low
8692015 but what were saying is it does mask the threat because it might not reveal the changes in the way hiv is spreading
8692016 why is climate change so important simply because its a major obstacle a major hurdle to our achievement of the millennium development goals

8692024 our belief is that most americans even apsa members have no idea how precarious the rights of freedom of speech and conscience are in canada
8692025 our belief is that the apsa should choose its sites carefully with particular regard for questions of freedom of speech and conscience we therefore believe canada to be a problematic destination

8692030 t he writ of canadas hrcs runs without evident limit to encompass any speech academic or otherwise to which potential complainants take offense
8692031 arbitrariness and procedurally unconstrained practices of the hrcs create an air of uncertainty regarding whose speech on what subjects before what audiences will be targeted next
8692032 the septic idea of policing public opinion has spread rapidly through many canadian institutions under tireless pressure from activists of various kinds feminist homosexual islamist and miscellaneous leftist who hold the notion of free speech in contempt
8692033 freedom of speech is an american concept so i dont give it any value

8692036 protecting civilians does not mean arming them security forces of the philippine government already have that role
8692037 we do not want to return to a period in our country when vigilante groups attacked civilians with impunity
8692038 im quite alarmed by the resurgence of such kinds of group it does not help solve the situation any i think the policy of having police auxiliaries is sufficient just to protect the communities but ilagas with their connotation of having some quasi cultural significance in conflict is quite alarming
8692039 historically vigilantism in the philippines resulted to massacres and bloody killings of civilians the vigilantes including alsa masa mass revolt tadtads chop chop and ilagas rats committed gross human rights abuses during martial law and in the few years post martial law
8692040 go back to the negotiating table and ensure that no civilians are attacked in their operations
8692041 the deployment of civilian militias paramilitary groups and vigilantism can set off a chain of reprisals and only increase the danger faced by civilians
8692042 security forces have to be trained on human rights and international humanitarian law as well as un standards for law enforcement officers and for the use of force and firearms
8692043 government forces should strictly observe article 8 of the un code of conduct for law enforcement officials which states that officials shall to the best of their capability prevent and rigorously oppose any violations of law and human rights and if they have reason to believe that a violation of the code of conduct has occurred they must report the matter to their superior vested with reviewing or remedial power
8692044 those who violated international law from all sides of the conflict must be held to account
8692045 if the ilagas are going to substantiate their threats that would certainly exacerbate the situation but it might also prove terminal to the milf leaders because the ilaga are composed of christian settlers who are determined to defend their settlements against what they look upon as marauders they do not agree with the milf or mnlf members that these members have the sovereign right to their homeland they believe that it is the ilagas who have their homeland in mindanao because they were the original settlers there this is basically an argument over who came there first
8692046 vigilantes and the indiscriminate arming of civilians are not allowed
8692047 the resurrection of the dreaded armed group will only escalate the armed conflict in the region and lead to massive human rights abuses
8692048 things remain very uncertain not just in the united states but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well

8692074 cited economic hardship as a reason for obtaining an abortion three fourths also cited having a child as interfering with work or school or child care responsibilities as a reason
8692075 how economic policies aimed at supporting low income mothers and working families affect the abortion rate
8692076 too often our abortion debate has been used to score political points by both sides rather than to identify what kinds of public policies will actually prevent and reduce abortions in america this data shows that policy makers on both sides of the aisle have a moral imperative to enact legislation that provides economic and social supports for vulnerable women and families in order to reduce abortions
8692077 it requires concrete programs and public policies that help women and families with robust economic and social supports both political parties can agree to unite behind comprehensive strategies that reduce abortions
8692078 would decrease abortions by about 15 percent or 150 000 nationwide

8692110 when stephanie was on your side you had an incredible ally
8692111 she would want this occasion to be a celebration and uplifiting she would fill up the room when she was in our small kitchen or fill up the room when she was in a convention hall
8692112 the great thing about stephanie tubbs jones the great thing about great leaders you can see it in barack and bill clinton and hillary clinton theyre having fun as they lead having fun while theyre doing it and thats a lesson we can all learn from her

8692320 if enough players arent coming through that will affect england
8692321 theres no doubt about that and were seeing it happen in football
8692322 there will always be foreign players and coaches and we dont have an issue with that if theyre of high quality
8692323 what we do have an issue with is the run of the mill foreign player who is standing in the way of the development of some very good english youngsters
8692324 the balance is shifting back to english players now and thats something we need to protect because long term if that starts to fall then were in trouble
8692325 in time the scheme will have the desired effect because you will have chief executives looking at the figures and asking why arent their academies producing good quality players
8692326 clubs such as wasps and leicester have seen the benefits of relying on english qualified players while gloucester and harlequins are moving in that direction

8692330 it basically comes down to how frequently theyre having symptoms and how much the symptoms are affecting their life
8692331 avoiding caffeine eliminating fatty or acidic foods losing excess weight and quitting smoking are all things patients can do to control their acid reflux
8692332 if people are having symptoms on a daily basis or more than three times a week we usually recommend they start medication
8692333 most patients suffering from mild acid reflux will treat themselves with over the counter medications
8692334 antacids are better for immediate relief like after a big meal because their effectiveness is short lived in nature and only lasts for as long as its in the system
8692335 you should see a doctor if your symptoms are not controlled by over the counter medicines because it could be a sign of a more serious condition
8692336 carafate is a liquid suspension that essentially coats the inside of the esophagus its short lived in its effectiveness because once the coating wears off its not going to do much
8692337 we really only prescribe it for people who have symptoms less than a couple times a week or month

8692344 we have introduced three new assessments to viva the first is a vision test that would be similar an eye exam at the doctors this is a screening to see if someone should go to the eye doctor we test visual acuity by asking the resident to name the letters they see on the computer screen as they get smaller we test sensitivity to contrast by asking the resident to name letters as they get lighter and darker and we test visual field by having the resident focus on the center of computer screen as dots appear in the peripheral field of view these tests can help see if one might need an eyeglasses prescription updated and it can help see areas that may be blind spots that the eye doctor should take a second look at
8692345 the third new assessment is called drivers health inventory and it incorporates vision and reaction time as well as working memory as well as physical capability to help determine an individuals risk when driving

8692389 i think this is the first of its kind senator mccain is going to speak direct to camera to barack obama im not going to give away many more details than that but suffice to say its going to be a very exciting ad and i think its going to get a lot of attention

8692393 the tax payers are going to end up spending millions and millions of dollars to restore and replace these homes and to subsidize the flood insurance on them they would restore or replace the roads the water the sewer lines after the hurricanes come
8692394 the first 250 000 would come from the federal government just like katrina and places in florida but anything above would be dependent on what the homeowner has for his own personal insurance

8692397 armed with full rights for the european seniors tour in india for three years
8692398 non compliance would invite a boycott of european tour events by pgti players
8692399 there is no question of exerting pressure arc was made to realise by the european tour that we are the sanctioning body in india
8692400 we got involved because unlike pgti we had the players the cut off age for the tournament is 50 years there was no intention to encroach on pgtis area of activity arcs behaviour has been childish they should have come to us and matters could have been sorted as we had no objection to pgti coming aboard we had even offered to get sponsors
8692401 as the sanctioning body we had an agreement with the promoter only on the dates if theres been a breach its between arc and the seniors tours
8692402 i have stepped down from promoting golf as i need to look at other businesses nick is the man to talk to
8692403 the contract we had with the pgai was for the indian seniors championship an event that never took off
8692404 though the two were not forthcoming on wednesday the contentious issue did cause discomfort during a discussion in july
8692405 the event is co sanctioned by the pgti we should not dwell on what has happened
8692406 it was the european tours decision that the tournament be held under the aegis of the pgti such discussions at the tour level happen all the time and as promoters we do not come into the picture
8692407 the event is being co sanctioned by the pgti besides we do comment on other peoples business
8692408 after the olympics everything is back to the way it was before in china
8692409 we just thought we were going to throw a party with a few of our friends

8692424 people can sit around adjusting their spectacles and analyzing but they have no idea how it feels to actually compete

8692426 the fight over energy is the critical civil rights battle of our era
8692427 simply put energy transforms the civil rights enshrined in our constitution into civil rights we enjoy in reality
8692428 who produce energy for everything we do everything we buy everything we dream of
8692429 are people who try to stop them activists and politicians against oil and gas drilling against coal mining against nuclear power against all energy production choking off the abundant reliable affordable american resources we need
8692430 sometimes i think environmentalists would rather see you jobless homeless or even dead than to support fossil fuel use even the best cleanest and most abundant
8692431 the fear and loathing that some have for oil natural gas coal and nuclear power is no excuse for us our policy makers or our courts to ignore energy reality and widen our energy gap by promoting renewable illusions and closing off access to the real energy we need
8692432 im a strong believer i think she must have had a guardian angel im so happy

8692442 they can open our mail but the can t open economic opportunities they can track our every move but they lost track of the economy while the cost of food gasoline and electricity skyrockets now they have skillfully played our post 9 11 fears and theyve allowed the few to profit at the expense of the many
8692443 devilstower and i just went to a talk here at the dnc featuring t
8692444 the senate is currently conducting an internal investigation in an attempt to discover who is behind this once we learn their identity that information will be turned over to law enforcement and we would expect it to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law

8692450 we have traced the hard drive and are currently retrieving it the purchaser is co operating with charnwood and has stated that the data has not been distributed to any other parties
8692451 we can confirm that an individual has been arrested and is assisting the police with their inquiries
8692452 as this is now a criminal investigation the council is unable to make any further comments at this stage we have also notified the information commissioner of this incident
8692453 i regret the concern caused to charnwood residents by this serious matter we have worked vigorously to investigate the case
8692454 for certain events the most important thing is to learn the result instantly
8692455 thats exactly the case with mobile tv and the olympics
8692456 tv will become a standard feature for cellphones in china by the end of this year just like cameras
8692457 the original plan was to distribute the phones after the games
8692458 however china mobile decided to do it before the games kicked off because they think the development of mobile tv technology has already reached a satisfactory level
8692459 nowadays peoples attention and time is segmented so they want multi functional converged handsets
8692460 so copying tv content to mobile phones is attractive to many people
8692461 if you have a boom peoplell have money to spend so you have customers
8692462 when you have a downturn you have more customers because they have nothing to do
8692463 recruiting is hard its just finding the needles in the haystack
8692464 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
8692465 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
8692466 were putting that technology in place to enable us to do that
8692467 everybody has a camera in their telephones when people can record an event taking place that helps us during an investigation its helpful
8692468 i think that while its appropriate for the police department to invite video reports of wrong doing both by ordinary people and police officers the new york police department has a long way to go to ensure that police officers who engage in wrongdoing like what was captured in the two video tapes that were recently disclosed are held accountable
8692469 we definitely expect a slowdown in the growth of the tv market
8692470 if you compete in the low end you end up damaging your brand and your profitability
8692471 because of the economic slowdown the chinese market has been very difficult
8692472 there is still a lot of room to improve profitability

8692484 job seekers in some fields are competing aggressively for open positions giving employers the edge in those segments of the hiring market at the same time however companies continue to face a shortage of highly skilled professionals in fields such as technology and accounting these in demand workers may not be willing to leave secure positions unless firms extend very attractive job offers
8692485 we want to make sure that our game runs very well on low system specs we want to make sure that our engine supports our stylized look so for us its really more that kind of iterative improvement works a little bit better for us
8692486 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different

8692492 isnt it far fetched district authorities blaming a particular outfit within minutes of arriving at a crime scene
8692493 in december 2007 the area witnesses some of the bloodiest violence orissa has even seen after the swami was attacked by christians the state might have wanted to avert a repeat of the communal clashes and therefore could have pinned the blame on the maoists
8692494 elections are coming in a matter of months the state has failed miserably in tackling the maoist insurgency a government that has been terrorised by the maoists may in turn be trying to terrorise the people in the name of the maoists

8692504 i dont think a player should be able to play for two clubs in the same competition in the same season and i think we need to get the uefa strategic committee to look at the whole idea
8692505 i think that it is wrong that a player can play for two clubs in any competition scoring a goal for one team one week and then scoring against them a few weeks later
8692506 i also think we have to look at both the summer and winter transfer windows the season starts in many countries in july or early in august yet the transfer window does not close till the end of august
8692507 then we have another window in the middle of the season i think we need to look at the way the system works
8692508 we cannot force a young player to sign for his first club after that age

8692533 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8692534 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8692535 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice

8692545 obviously harvest progress will dictate how many wheat acres are seeded in most of southern illinois
8692546 it is important that soil moisture and temperature are adequate to produce uniform stands
8692547 may planting enhances the opportunity for greater seed yields and oil percentages vs mid june or later planting
8692548 head moth has long been a challenge for kansas growers and the old adage of planting in mid june or later to avoid moth flights and treatment is no longer valid
8692549 the increased use of no till farming practices has resulted in increased stem weevil damage in the past decade as well
8692550 successful sunflower production can be enhanced with timely and effective scouting and treatment for both of these pests if necessary
8692551 this allows for a quick uniform drydown in the fall which leads to a timely harvest
8692552 sunflowers are effective compensators and will increase head size if final populations are decreased larger heads often lead to delayed drydown maturity and harvest with increased potential for losses to birds and plant lodging

8692570 we are committed to protecting the shore and its visitors and will prosecute to the full extent of the law anyone found to have violated our criminal statutes by dumping this waste into the ocean
8692571 the saab 9 x biohybrid blends organic form with ecologically sound propulsion for both aesthetic and environmental appeal
8692572 saab takes center stage with a new design approach for a compact vehicle with the biohybrid turbo engine included we have a winner
8692573 we are honored by this important recognition from an expert north american media organization
8692574 following in the footsteps of the highly inspirational aero x and the 9 4x biopower crossover concept which also debuted earlier this year the 9 x biohybrid demonstrates that saab is truly on the move
8692575 this car is all about efficiency in design and performance
8692576 you could say we designed this car from back to front
8692577 the shape of the 9x is right for a car of this size and the longer roof line helps the aerodynamics as well as providing more rear headroom and interior space
8692578 this car shows how our concept work can be carried forward into a compact format
8692579 it has a number of features which we will be developing further such as the new driver focused design theme the importance of clean uncluttered surfaces and the easy seamless connectivity inside the car
8692580 you have plenty of money just buy the damn insurance
8692581 i used the metro to go shopping meet friends for hospital appointments and to go swimming thats gone now
8692582 i collected 1 000 names on a petition from people against the first ban but it hasnt made a blind bit of difference
8692583 this is only penalising the majority for the mistakes of a few there will be a serious impact on hundreds of people
8692584 if a scooter fell on to the metro line and was hit by a train then not only would its user probably be killed or seriously hurt but so would perhaps dozens of people on the train if it was derailed
8692585 that risk is not acceptable there is also the danger of passengers standing in the path of a scooter could be injured as it boards the confined space of a carriage
8692586 scooters are not designed to manoeuvre in confined spaces like platforms and trains
8692587 if a scooter goes on to the track and people are on there assisting we have an uncontrolled situation
8692588 heaven forbid the type of carnage that could occur if a train ploughs into them we have reached a situation where we have to eliminate risk our first and foremost responsibility is to maintain a safe railway
8692589 our first responsibility is to protect the safety of all our passengers
8692590 mobility scooters are vehicles designed to drive on urban roads not confined spaces like station platforms and trains
8692591 this ban wont be popular with scooter users but it is the right thing to do
8692592 its very very important that the disability community be inclusive with the general population
8692593 they need to learn who we are and we need to do outreach to them and tell them that we want to work
8692594 i guess from the day that i was injured i started working and advocating because i was advocating for myself
8692595 but as i went to rehabs and hospitals i saw people that didnt have the skill level that didnt have the family support that i had that were not being able to access services
8692596 we have a function prototype and we are planning to produce two to three models for homologation
8692597 we are considering making a battery powered version and a variant for people without any physical handicap
8692598 he is completely distraught all of them are his family his girlfriend
8692599 failing that he will be extradited probably within the next three weeks
8692600 our expert naoto ikeda trained a team of 15 disabled persons which conducted a survey to point out the major issues that need to be addressed on an urgent basis
8692601 the basic problem faced by these people is their exclusion from society and the project thus would focus on the issue
8692602 lessons learnt from the project will help in implementing the npa throughout the country
8692603 the team concluded that there is need for such approaches that not only focus on providing more quality services but also aim at promoting social participation of pwds
8692604 we will also provide trainings in japan malaysia and bangkok
8692605 the project is designed in a way that more and more disabled persons could be involved in the process
8692606 slowly the main cities and then the entire country will be made disabled friendly
8692607 we hope that what target does can be used as an example for other retailers
8692608 for people who cant drive to a mall its particularly important to be able to buy things online
8692609 if youre not in care not cash you cant make a reservation for a bed and youre thrown into this byzantine system where every day you have to stand in line and try to find a bed
8692610 it becomes survival of the fittest and disabled people lose and end up sleeping in alleys
8692611 care not cash serves a subset of the homeless population those receiving county welfare its a rational and nondiscriminatory policy
8692612 theyre assuming the shelter system is full and there are massive turn aways every night and its simply not true
8692613 we feel this is a frivolous suit thats entirely without merit
8692614 it takes me two and a quarter hours to get ready to go to work if its going to be cut to three hours a day what am i supposed to do the rest of the day
8692615 described theatre was new from the states there was only one company in the uk doing it and a blind customer sheila birkett proposed we try it sheila hadnt always been blind but had always loved theatre so she knew what she was missing
8692616 sheila found she wanted to know what the actors were wearing what the fabrics looked like she could sense the audiences reaction but not know what it was to
8692617 a blind person cant just turn to their companion and ask whats going on because it disrupts those around them you can imagine the sense of isolation
8692618 i think there is a lot of room for it to grow
8692619 it began with smaller theatres with arts council funding going for it then the more commercial theatres joined in because legislation said they had to but this can just mean one described performance a year or every few months it would be great to give people more choice
8692620 matinees are popular for described performances because often older people dont like going out too late at night
8692621 or maybe they work during the week or have to rely on public transport
8692622 here is the make shift shower in which nellie will wash that man right out of her hair
8692623 the touching of a grass skirt is a novelty some people are partially sighted and need to get up close to make things out the touch tour gives that chance
8692624 the polynesian children ngana and jerome are found locally and id described them as being dark skinned but norwich being less multi cultural than areas like say bradford they were much lighter skinned than id imagined one just wants to describe the details accurately
8692625 im often asked why the descriptions arent recorded but of course they couldnt be because the gaps in the dialogue are never going to be exactly the same its different every time you need to be prepared and confident i often watch at least three run throughs plus videos over and over i write the script myself so know it well you are complimenting what the actors are doing and it should all blend together i didnt even notice you is the best compliment i could get
8692626 i have done a film festival where i had to read the speech subtitles as well as describe and it was a bit of a one woman show but generally you just match delivery with piece it must be pleasant and not jarring if its a romantic scene your tone should reflect that but not so much that youre weeping if someone is dying on stage
8692627 when someone says i loved it when you told me so and so had pinched someones bottom i could just imagine it or you made me cry you know youve brought something to life for them the other day a woman said to me you made me feel like i was back in the land of the living
8692628 these kinds of initiatives allow everyone to have an equal footing blind people have just as much right to access facilities they pay taxes too and contribute to society when youve lost your sight something has been taken away from you and this is a way of enjoying the things one perhaps used to love
8692629 it will help people get to work and school and medical appointments
8692630 we are very concerned on the impact this will have on our 2009 budget
8692631 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8692632 and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8692633 shared dreams martin luther king jr and the jewish community
8692634 i see barack obama as representing a new generation that can right the wrights and can really educate and sensitize them to the importance of embracing martin luther kings jewish legacy
8692635 no segment of american society provided as much and as consistent support to dr king and to the african american community as the jewish community
8692636 there are some very fond memories about the alliance between jews and african americans but i dont see people harking back to that time
8692637 one thing that works in obamas favor is his mantra that the 60s are so yesterday
8692638 hes not a descendent of slaves hes not trying to refight the cultural wars that gives him space to distance himself from the divisive politics of jesse jackson and louis farrakhan
8692639 nothing could be better for the jewish community than to have both parties vying for the jewish vote
8692640 what makes america a great country in my view is that
8692641 denmarks immigration policy is not going to change the voters need to know that the law holds mr rasmussen told voters in a speech on tuesday night 26 august in his constituency of greve bloomberg reported
8692642 were trying to change the set of rules inside the eu so that we can get things as we want them mr rasmussen added
8692643 these are chickens that consumers expected to be processed for meat that would be distributed as tzedakah
8692644 participants at ncfje clearly did not expect the chickens they made kapporos with to be disposed of as trash
8692645 to my knowledge i didnt throw out any chickens last year
8692646 last time i checked in this country we have a right to swing a chicken over our head and give it to the poor to eat its a beautiful thing
8692647 if something is wrong we have to clean up our act
8692648 theyre supposed to put the chickens in cones to bleed out
8692649 these youngsters were just taking them after shechting and putting them in garbage bags
8692650 here you can see in the whole shechting area theyre piled five to six layers high
8692651 some of them are still alive theres blood everywhere its the most unhygienic thing ive ever seen
8692652 they slaughtered too many couldnt process them then dumped them in the garbage
8692653 they buy chickens hire a shochet and have no supervision its true it got out of hand
8692654 there were people walking around from place to place checking
8692655 the consumer has to say i will not go to a kapparot center that is not supervised and their rabbi has to tell them not to go
8692656 it could open up the door for groups like peta to give trouble to the legal ones
8692657 but each community has the right to practice its own customs
8692658 now is the time on sprockets when we transfer sin to the chicken now grab the chicken by its feet and spin it overhead then we will pluck it slit its throat and throw the newly sin filled bird into the dumpster for we are the chosen people of that dude in the sky
8692659 what we do claim is that the northern european and particularly anglo saxons made this country oh yes the others helped they added to it they often enriched it but they did not make it and they have not yet greatly changed it and what we assert is that we are not going to surrender it to somebody else or allow other people no matter what their merits to make it something different
8692660 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
8692661 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8692662 relying exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8692663 the appropriate sides to resolve the existing problems through peaceful dialogue and apply efforts to reconciliation and promotion of negotiations
8692664 the sco member states welcome the adoption in moscow on aug 12 2008 of the six principles of resolving the conflict in south ossetia and support the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8692665 serious signal for those are trying to justify the aggression
8692666 the soviet union was not so alone even in 1968
8692667 as of now we can say with confidence that in both regions abkhazia and ossetia ethnic cleansing is fully completed
8692668 theyve expelled from all villages remnants of the georgian population theyve destroyed their houses theyve looted their property theyve burned down their fields forests

8692680 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8692681 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8692682 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8692683 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8692684 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8692685 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8692686 visually mediated motor planning in the escape response of drosophila
8692687 we have set trends in the consumer electronics industry worldwide by creating products with the most advanced technology and most insightful designs
8692688 we are working to appeal to the sophisticated tastes of consumers in europe more than anywhere else to help them enjoy smart and stylish living
8692689 we are proud to be the forerunner in having this system that amongst other things is highly scalable to cater for business growth mergers and acquisitions the rhb banking group in line with its aspiration to be a convenient one stop financial institution has continually explored all possibilities in integrating all its available products and services
8692690 this investment and collaboration with ibm is the platform that will help us realize the objective of providing continuous banking services to our customers in making this choice we have also taken into account how this mainframe system will enable us to consolidate and streamline our core banking systems and day to day operation of other businesses within the rhb banking group
8692691 rhb has proven its innovation stance as it leads the way in adopting the world most powerful computer the ibm system z10 enterprise class to meet the escalating needs of its clients locally and regionally
8692692 our relationship with rhb is one which we have built for more than a decade and we have seen the banking group grow and prosper and we are confident that they will reach their goals while keeping clients needs at heart
8692693 instead of looking for a particular kind of structure we came up with a broader algorithm that is able to look for all of these structures and weigh them against each other
8692694 we think of children as taking in data forming theories and testing those theories with experiments theyre like little scientists
8692695 until now theres been no good computational model for how children can like scientists grasp the underlying global structure of a set of data
8692696 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8692697 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8692698 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8692699 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8692700 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8692701 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect
8692702 the unfavorable findings from the three trials have not been fully realized by the medical community
8692703 safer cheaper and more effective treatment alternatives are available that do not carry these negative cardiovascular risks in patients with diabetes the rationale for the use of the thiazolidinediones is unclear
8692704 once developed this molecule will cause much less wheezing and shortness of breath and should be able to be given safely to the hundreds of thousands of patients with both heart and lung diseases furthermore because it will have so few side effects it has the potential to become the beta blocker of choice for all heart patients
8692705 we know that beta blockers save lives in patients with heart disease so making them safe for those unlucky enough to have a respiratory disorder as well is a clinical imperative i applaud jill baker for questioning why beta blockers should remain contraindicated for so many of her patients and being stirred to correct this with an incisive programme of work in the best traditions of medical research this endeavour was born out of a problem encountered at the sharp end of clinical practice
8692706 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8692707 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8692708 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8692709 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure

8692712 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8692713 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8692714 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8692715 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8692716 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8692717 i rely on him and i have for many years
8692718 weve made progress with democrats and it makes sense because people have seen a party this week thats unified

8692741 its our intention to retain as many current gabberts employees as possible
8692742 the home furnishings industry has gone through dramatic changes over the last decade making it very difficult to sustain a single store independent retail operation even in a great economy with great people doing great work
8692743 its become impossible for us to do it in todays economy while its been a difficult decision were pleased gabberts will continue to be independently owned and operated by a minnesota based family built brand we cant think of a better organization to carry on the gabberts legacy

8692801 were happy to bring this grand conflict to the wii and give players the chance to help determine who the ultimate champions are
8692802 expect smartphone unit sales to reach over 700 million of the total 1 8 billion handset market thats 65 or 200 billion worth of the total 312 billion mobile phone market at that time
8692803 we have continued to cut costs and improve the responsiveness of our operations
8692804 unfortunately the rapid and accelerating decline of sales in the motor home industry during the first quarter caused heavy operating losses that were exacerbated by an aggressive discounting environment and downtime at our plants while the travel trailer division also had a loss quarter its performance was improved over the prior year the housing group remained profitable despite the challenging environment in that industry
8692805 we are experiencing some of the toughest industry conditions that we have seen since the late 1970s and early 1980s
8692806 dealers are reducing their inventories significantly and manufacturers orders are considerably below the dealers weak retail sales rates considering the current business climate we are pleased with the turnout indicated for our rv national dealer meeting next week we will be showcasing our newest products with innovative floor plans and exciting decor packages although we expect dealers to remain cautious for the foreseeable future we are eager to demonstrate to them why fleetwood remains an excellent choice as their business partner going forward
8692807 we believe that once the excess inventory of site built housing begins to clear the prospects for manufactured housing should improve
8692808 also the housing bill recently passed by congress contains several positives for our industry which should continue to narrow the gap between site built and manufactured housing lending practices we expect the difficult environment to continue for at least a couple more quarters however as shipments continue to lag throughout the country particularly in the retirement states of california arizona and florida in the meantime our trendsetter modular division has substantially completed two military contracts at fort bliss and fort sill and is in advanced stages of negotiations for additional similar contracts we have received positive feedback on our involvement to date and we expect to continue to participate in the armys military housing renovation plans
8692809 business conditions are expected to remain challenging at least through our third fiscal quarter resulting in losses and negative operating cash flows for fleetwood through that same period
8692810 we continue to aggressively pursue cost reductions and carefully manage
8692811 despite a modest but unavoidable build up of motor home chassis and finished goods inventories in the first quarter cash and marketable investments totaled 85 7 million at july 27 2008 with virtually no borrowings on our revolving credit facility
8692812 since then we have raised an additional 26 5 million from real estate financing a successful refinancing of the 5 debentures is the next step in our strategy to put fleetwood in a position of strength relative to current economic conditions and posture the company for an advantageous future we believe in the long term strength and viability of both our industries and look forward to continuing our participation as a leader in each as the markets recover
8692813 if you let a culprit like that endorse your product it speaks about your site and your products credibility

8692816 mark cuban is not a tech visionary he is a lucky bastard broadcast com was a joke
8692817 i personally think that the optimal connection will be personally managed hard drives
8692818 blu ray disc or hd dvd quality content or better will be possible but you wont get that quality from a download the reality is that its cheaper and faster to send hard drives with terabytes of content overnight via ups than it is to download it over the net brown is faster than the net
8692819 so the smart company will send you hard drives full of content that you will pick and choose from
8692820 you people talk a lot of shit for being clueless
8692821 non e stato trovato alcun accordo domenica non ci sara calcio in chiaro sulla rai ne in video ne in audio
8692822 la rai ha fatto il massimo sforzo stara alla lega valutare ha aggiunto cappon abbiamo anche accettato di rinunciare allesclusiva come proposto dalla lega per poter offrire i diritti anche a mediaset ma la lega non ha accettato neanche questultima proposta e non ha accettato nemmeno e questo mi provoca un profondo rammarico di vendere i diritti per la radio allo stesso importo dellanno scorso
8692823 adesso spettera alla lega fare delle valutazioni interne ha detto ancora il direttore generale della rai lo sforzo della rai e stato notevolissimo la nostra e stata lofferta migliore avendo incrementato del 20 la cifra proposta quello della lega e un atteggiamento sul quale tutti devono riflettere il loro obiettivo erano 50 milioni noi siamo partiti da una procedura proposta dalla lega e abbiamo fatto anche degli ulteriori sforzi ma il loro approccio e stato o un certo importo o niente cosi non si puo trattare
8692824 voglio che le squadre di calcio riflettano su questo genere di politica i club hanno incassato questanno 200 milioni di euro dai diritti pay ha proseguito cappon e non possono non rendersi conto del minor valore dei diritti in chiaro
8692825 a lungo termine tutto questo e dannoso per il calcio ha concluso se la lega vuole privare gli italiani del calcio in chiaro e stata una sua scelta

8692846 however that could change within a year home prices are becoming affordable again so the decline in prices is likely more than half over

8692896 hoosiers should not have to pay a premium to buy their beer cold
8692897 village pantry would absolutely not charge customers more for buying cold beer that would be like charging our customers more for coffee that is hot

8692913 this discovery is very encouraging and a great step forward in our quest to create new cancer treatments
8692914 because of the role hls5 plays in keeping cell growth at a normal rate we expect that these compounds will greatly slow down the growth of cancer cells
8692915 our preliminary data reveals that several of these compounds do indeed markedly slow down the growth of human cancer cells
8692916 importantly we also know through computer modeling that nearly all of these compounds have drug like qualities
8692917 from here we take the research to the next phase of laboratory testing with the ultimate hope of investigating if one of these molecules can be used to create a fresh treatment that can slow growth of cancer cells in patients

8693016 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8693017 the department doesnt comment on matters of extradition unless and until an individual is extradited and on u s soil
8693018 any steps might allow us to feel good that we have done something but they dont amount to much and they certainly dont amount to something that will change russian behavior
8693019 i think there is very little frankly that the u s can do to compel the russians to change their behavior especially in the short term
8693020 lets face it we arent the biggest power in the region
8693021 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8693022 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8693023 people are using stagnant water and if it is not purified it could lead to some serious implications
8693024 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon

8693034 it isnt fair my friend but it just makes it easier for me to whup him
8693035 im looking toward the future now a future that looks very bright once we send twig legs back to the back bench
8693036 hes a bright young man but he got ahead of himself
8693037 he needs to be taught a lesson and were the ones to do it have you seen the new bloomberg poll obamas dropped and were even again the bullets getting all the credit but you and i know hillary that its these top secret counseling sessions were having and thanks again for blackberrying me the rick warren questions while i was in the so called cone of silence
8693038 oh john you know i love you and im happy to help
8693039 the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity when were rich celebrities too turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card that one always cracks me up and accusing the media especially nbc of playing favorites its easy to get the stupid press to navel gaze theyre so insecure
8693040 especially since they deserted me for the messiah seriously hill that paris britney ad you came up with was brilliant i owe you
8693041 his secret fear is being seen as a dumb blonde
8693042 he wants to take a short cut to the top and pose on glossy magazine covers but he doesnt want to be seen as a glib pretty boy
8693043 if i do say so myself while the rookie was surfing in hawaii i ate his pupus for lunch pictures of him pushing around a golf ball while im pushing around putin priceless
8693044 i have a little secret to tell you about that john bill made it happen he loves you so much he called putin and told him that if he invaded georgia he could count on being invited to the clinton global initiative every year for the rest of his life
8693045 wow should i call him i saw your husbands kind words about me in las vegas on monday saying id be just as good as obama on climate change
8693046 hes still boiling at obama and you dont have to worry about my army of angry women weve spread the word in the feminist underground as opposed to that wacky obama weather underground that catharsis is code for no surrender my gals know when i say we may have started on two separate paths but were on one journey now that skinnys journey is to the nearest exit
8693047 hes starting a blistering tv campaign and attacking me for attacking his patriotism
8693048 now john you know that every time he tries to get tough he quickly runs out of gas sometimes in debates hed be exhausted by the third question he must use up all his energy in the gym he doesnt have any stamina and he certainly doesnt have our bloodlust besides you can throw that mark penn stuff at him that i couldnt use in a democratic primary about how hes not fundamentally american in his thinking and values while hes up on his high minded pedestal youll scoot past him in your ferragamos
8693049 you can announce that you wont be running for re election because youd be 76 and you can pick somebody really lame to run with like your pal lieberman that means one term for you and two for me
8693050 that was inspired to snatch his convention away makes him look so weak listen why dont you stop in sedona on the way to denver wear a black wig and ill spirit you up to the cabin for the night ill catch a catfish in the mill pond and grill it for you it will be an adventure
8693051 great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds
8693052 an appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last
8693053 affirmative action is something the good dont need and the bad dont deserve
8693054 the men who create power make an indispensable contribution to the nations greatness but the men who question power make a contribution just as indispensable especially when that questioning is disinterested for they determine whether we use power or power uses us
8693055 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
8693056 i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually
8693057 hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is but a broken winged bird that cannot fly
8693058 attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference
8693059 dreams are true while they last and do we not live in dreams
8693060 nothing in the world can take the place of persistence
8693061 never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake
8693062 for evil to triumph it is only necessary for good men to do nothing
8693063 war begins in the minds of men and it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must first be constructed
8693064 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders the country is the real thing the substantial thing the eternal thing it is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to institutions are extraneous they are its mere clothing and clothing can wear out become ragged cease to be comfortable cease to protect the body from winter disease and death
8693065 patriotism is to support your country all the time and your government when it deserves it
8693066 the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man
8693067 the power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it
8693068 democracy is a system ensuring that the people are governed no better than they deserve
8693069 if we dont believe in freedom of expression for people we despise we dont believe in it at all
8693070 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
8693071 when the people fear the government you have tyranny when the government fears the people you have freedom
8693072 to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice
8693073 justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream
8693074 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character
8693075 i have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8693076 and when i got knocked down by guys bigger than me and this is the gods truth she sent me back out and said bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day and thats what i did
8693077 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8693078 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8693079 the warfare began aug 7 when georgia launched a barrage targeting south ossetia
8693080 are going to be bored because im going to give some back story that you know better than i do
8693081 a key tool that the soviet union used to keep its empire together
8693082 now the story starts really in 1992 when this fuse was lit in georgia
8693083 now theres two territories theres abkhazia which has clearly defined administrative borders and theres south ossetia that doesnt before the troubles started abkhazia was an extremely ethnically mixed area about 60 percent georgian 20 percent abkhaz and 20 percent assorted others greeks estonians armenians jews what have you in ossetia it was a completely integrated and completely mixed ossetian georgian population the ossetians and the georgians have never been apart in the sense that they were living in their own little villages and doing their own little things there has been inter marriage and a sense of common understanding going back to distant history the georgians will tell you about king tamar thats a woman but they called her a king and she was married to an ossetian so the fuse was lit and two wars start one in abkhazia and one in south ossetia
8693084 it was also lit in tbilisi there was a guy in charge here zviad gamsakhurdia a little bit like serbian nationalist war criminal in bosnia radovan karadzic he was a poet he was an intellectual but he was one of these guys who veered off into ethnic exclusivism he made stupid declarations like georgia is only for the georgians if youre running a multi ethnic country that is really not a clever thing to say the central control of the state was extremely weak the russians were trying to make things worse there was a civil war between georgians and tbilisi but the key thing is that here there were militias georgian militias and some of them pretty nasty
8693085 this guy zviad gamsakhurdia was driven from power from across the street they bombed this place
8693086 theres a horrible picture in my georgia book of this facade
8693087 of course he led the government in exile until he came back in 1993 then died obscurely in the mountains of suicide some people say others say cancer then he was buried in grozny
8693088 things here explode and basically it gets pretty nasty thomas can tell you what happened read his
8693089 youve got two bits of abkhazia which are not ethnic abkhazia
8693090 the first thing that misha mikheil saakashvili did was try to poke his finger in russian president vladimir putins eyes as many times as possible
8693091 most notably by wanting to join nato the west in my view mishandled this situation america gave the wrong signals so did europe
8693092 but basically the encouragement was given despite stronger and stronger russian signals that a georgian accession to nato would not be tolerated
8693093 just a little bit of back story again in july of 2007 russia withdrew from the conventional forces treaty in europe
8693094 one provocation was to use the russian media to launch shrill accusations that the georgian army was in kodori preparing for an invasion of abkhazia now if you go up there i took a bunch of journalists up there a few times when you get to the actual checkpoint you have a wall of crumbling rock a wooden bridge another wall of crumbling rock a raging torrent and a steep mountainside filled with woods its not possible to invade out or invade in unless youve got air support which is why the abkhaz were never able to kick these georgians out they just kept that bit of territory
8693095 but this time im getting advice from an expert on how im doing
8693096 the next provocation on april 16 putin signs a presidential decree recognizing the documents of abkhazians and south ossetians in russia and vice versa
8693097 starting in mid july the russians launched the biggest military exercise in the north caucasus that theyve held since the chechnya war
8693098 on august 3 the head of the local administration says hes evacuating his civilians
8693099 on top of that for the last four years the russians have been dishing out passports to anyone who asks in those areas
8693100 so back to the 3rd of august kokoity announces women and children should leave as it later turned out he made all the civilians leave who were not fighting or did not have fighting capabilities on the same day irregulars ingush chechen ossetians and cossacks start coming in and spreading out into the countryside but dont do anything they just sit and wait on the 6th of august the shelling intensifies from ossetian positions and for the first time since the war finished in 1992 they are using 120mm guns
8693101 because of the peace agreement they had nobody was allowed to have guns bigger than 80mm okay so thats the formal start of the war it wasnt the attack on tskhinvali now stop me
8693102 all the reports ive read say saakashvili started the war
8693103 saakashvili is accused of starting this war on the 7th
8693104 but that sounds like complete bs to me if what you say is true
8693105 it must be stopped if not today then maybe tomorrow my troops were in our village avnevi on the 6th of august they blew up our troops four wheel drives our pickups they blew them up also in this village it was august 5th or 6th i cant remember they started bombing us with shells two soldiers died that day our peacekeepers the ossetians had a good position on the hill they could see all our positions and our villages and they started bombing they went to the top of the hill bombed us then went down we couldnt see who was shooting at us
8693106 but it started that day from that place when two georgians were killed
8693107 before they started bombing us they took all the civilians out of their villages
8693108 then they started damaging our villages houses a gas pipe roads yards they killed our animals they evacuated their villages then bombed our villages
8693109 but in another village i was fired upon on august 6th on the 5th of august they started shooting they blew up our peacekeeping trucks they put a bomb on the road and when they were driving they were blown up they also mined the roads used by civilians on the 6th of august they started bombing avnevi and at this time they took the civilians out of tskhinvali and sent them to north ossetia inside russia
8693110 they took the civilians kids women and put them on the bus and sent them to north ossetia
8693111 i was running away and the soldiers wounded me they robbed me and shot me in the leg with a kalashnikov i dont know if it was russians or ossetians they took my car took my gold chain and shot me
8693112 they didnt care if it was a house or a military camp
8693113 i saw it it was the russian military airplanes if they knew it was a georgian village they bombed all the houses many civilians were killed from this bombing
8693114 on the 6th while this is going on the integration minister who was until a few months ago an ngo guy and who believes in soft power things tried to go there and meet the separatist leadership
8693115 i stop firing first and if you fire i still wont fire back
8693116 on the evening of the 7th the ossetians launch an all out barrage focused on georgian villages not on georgian positions
8693117 what they had in the area was peacekeeping stuff not stuff for fighting a war
8693118 the georgians will tell you that they estimate that these two actions together slowed the russian advance by 24 to 48 hours
8693119 well actually im trying to go through tskhinvali in order to stop the russians
8693120 this is your first time to the lands of the former soviet union
8693121 may sound just like a rhetorical flourish with no echo in the american mindset what it means in the post soviet mindset is what boris yeltsin was doing in chechnya this was the stupidest phrase this guy possibly could have used thats why people want to lynch him
8693122 your presentation was deliciously comprehensive perhaps it was well ask our new friend michael too much information out of the gate to absorb
8693123 there are some details that i would chip in who are the ossetians and where do they live this is the question that has been lost in all of the static from this story this autonomy south ossetia is an autonomous district as opposed to an autonomous republic with about 60 000 people max so where are the rest of the ossetians guess where they live tbilisi here there everywhere there are more ossetians take a look around this lobby you will find ossetians here of those ossetians who are theoretically citizens of the republic of georgia 60 000 live there and around 40 000 live here
8693124 are they on the side of those who live in south ossetia
8693125 one of them is georgias minister of defense correction georgias minister of defense is jewish not ossetian georgia is a multi ethnic republic and the whole point of the ossetian ethnic question is this south ossetia is part of georgia
8693126 everyone regardless of nationality even those who love georgia genuinely thought saakashvili started it
8693127 absolutely weve been trying to tell the world about this for months if you go back and look at the archives youll see plenty of calls from the georgian government saying theyre really worried even some russian commentators agree that this is exactly what happened dont forget they sent in a lot of irregulars chechens cossacks ossetians ingush basically thugs not normal chechens or ingush thugs thugs out for a holiday many western camera crews were robbed at gunpoint ten meters from russian tanks while russian commanders just stood there smoking their cigarettes while the irregulars that happened to a turkish tv crew theyre lucky to still be alive some of the georgians were picked up by the irregulars if they happened to be female they got raped if they happened to be male they got shot immediately sometimes tortured injured people we have in hospitals who managed to get out have had arms chopped off eyes gouged out and their tongues ripped out
8693128 you also have to remember the propaganda campaign that came out
8693129 human rights watch is accusing the russian authorities of being indirectly responsible for the massive ethnic cleansing of georgians that happened in south ossetia
8693130 that goes on a lot where i usually work in the middle east
8693131 this hot potion is strong enough to keep a cube of sugar from sinking
8693132 the new music theater show crisis in camelot by john walsh
8693133 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another
8693134 israel missed a chance to learn from the most influential musicians of the decade and the beatles missed an opportunity to reach out to one of the most passionate audiences in the world
8693135 will finally get the chance to experience a night of music and history they have been waiting decades for
8693136 its a nice story in this case much nicer than the truth
8693137 they have been heavily selling stocks in almost all emerging markets including india at present it seems like they are liquidating their mid cap portfolio in india
8693138 sebi and irda should discuss the nature and characteristics of ulips and mutual funds and see whether there is a need for level playing field and 8230 with respect to tax benefits and regulations governing these
8693139 earlier sebi had circulated a paper seeking a level playing field for mutual funds with ulips with respect to expenses tax benefits and regulations governing the product marketing and operations of the business irda has already responded to the sebi paper
8693140 ulips are similar to mutual funds but has a insurance product and has an expense ratio that is significantly higher than what it is for the mutual fund industry
8693141 this leads to a higher distributor compensation and therefore a non level playing field
8693142 a level playing field for the mutual fund industry would mean that mutual funds should be allowed to offer insurance products to be provided by insurance companies that are regulated by the irda
8693143 the level playing field will also have to be in terms of the expense ratio
8693144 because of the commission structure there is a big advantage for the distributor to sell a ulip
8693145 also mutual funds are not allowed celebrity endorsement while insurance companies are
8693146 a level playing field should be there in the same line of business but ulip is entirely different from a mutual fund and so the solvency and investment requirement of the two are entirely different
8693147 mutual funds think that the life insurance companies are there to steal their future
8693148 it performs well for us and decisions are still being made regarding a second season
8693149 they have been heavily selling stocks in almost all emerging markets including india at present it seems like they are liquidating their mid cap portfolio in india
8693150 the problem is that they claim they are a registered body for pms while they are not
8693151 we have decided to take up the matter on our own
8693152 but since that is without a complaint it will take some time
8693153 while sebi registered pms managers need to be body corporates having a minimum net worth of rs 2 crore and collect a minimum amount of rs 5 lakh from a single client to be managed entities running such services without the regulators recognition are doing so without meeting any of these parameters
8693154 but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation a people belonging to god that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light

8693156 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today
8693157 the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8693158 this was a routine update of a biography by the obits department meant for the internal system and not meant for publication
8693159 it was momentarily posted on the external wire in error and immediately deleted
8693160 gt ns with the topic of the iraq war to realize their action they ask for a every donator will get a copy of their action result
8693161 we cant tell you what it is but we can say it will happen well before the presidential election that its fantastic and funny and smart and that it aims to change the discussion from just managing the iraq war to ending it
8693162 madam secretary maine the sun comes out in maine the first in the nation
8693163 15 votes for senator clinton and 55 votes for the next president of the united states barack obama
8693164 whether the country is ready for barack or not this convention is showing how rapidly this country is changing this country has had this feel for a long time but this is the first time that a convention is showing this reality
8693165 obama is an excellent speaker but as a debater he needs to provide a few more catchy sound bites
8693166 the biggest significance of this deal is that cnpc will benefit as the first international oil company to be developing one of the giant discovered oil fields in iraq in the new era
8693167 they will be the first with people on the ground and the first to develop a working relationship with iraqs oil ministry
8693168 given traditional markets have been dominated by well established international oil companies new entrants such as cnpc have to focus on new markets
8693169 the majors are going to have to seriously rethink their returns criteria and resource ownership flexibility
8693170 looking forward to future bidding rounds iraq could cease to be that opportunity that people had hoped for and become a different play altogether
8693171 its difficult to see this having a wider implication for the majors and other contracts
8693172 this is a self contained project and is different in many ways to the large scale projects to boost oil capacity elsewhere in iraq
8693173 if anything this is a sign that iraq is serious about these long term contracts and that shahristani can get them signed
8693174 this will focus big oil companies even more on the upcoming bid round
8693175 its not been a hasty decision and doesnt affect how our lineup would look in a wc3l game
8693176 but from a point of view of the community and warcraft 3 we feel such an addition brings something unique to the community and could give hope to the younger players from korea to develop their skills as well and not feel left out
8693177 ich glaube dass die neue moschee so ein architektonisches meisterwerk wird dass reisebusse mit touristen k nftig nicht nur den k lner dom ansteuern um ihn zu bewundern sondern auch das islamische gotteshaus

8693180 leading organizations recognize that their supply chains are critical to their growth profitability and strategic effectiveness especially in a world in which supply chains have become increasingly global complex time sensitive and fraught with risk

8693182 to spread the word to their friends and family that buckling up saves lives the competition draws thousands of entries around the country which is a good sign that students realize it s an important issue
8693183 there is a huge amount of uncertainty as to why there are big natural swings in co2 levels
8693184 its clear from our work that the greenland ice sheet is very sensitive to carbon dioxide levels but its wrong to draw inferences about what will happen
8693185 you cant say that if you get to the level of 400 ppm the ice sheet will melt in the next hundred years because we dont know enough about the process it might be easier to create an icesheet than to melt if you reverse what you did before you dont necessarily get the same answer back
8693186 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8693187 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8693188 i came across two little black marsh fly puparia and kept them in jam jars on my desk expecting that adult marsh flies might hatch but what emerged were two different species of parasitic wasp
8693189 when we finally discovered that one of these insects had never been recorded before the question then was what to call this creature
8693190 after resisting the temptation to name it after someone i know who really wants to be named after a parasite we settled on naming it mesoleptus hibernica in honour of the country where it was discovered
8693191 its higher than what we have now but its not that much more because its worded in terms of percentage of effort rather than of the cap
8693192 the annual use of credits offsets by installations shall not exceed a quantity equal to 25 percent of the greenhouse gas emission reductions required for the installations covered compared to the average emissions of the installations concerned in the period 2008 to 2012
8693193 this would enter into force in 2013 with or without an international agreement
8693194 deutsche bank has long been committed to environmental sustainability so it was natural to extend that commitment to the deutsche bank championship
8693195 golf is a sport enjoyed in natural surroundings and our goal is to continually reduce the environmental impact of our event and to offset any remaining impact so that the championship can be enjoyed by generations of fans to come
8693196 we have made significant strides in how the deutsche bank championship approaches the issue of protecting and preserving the environment
8693197 we understand how important it is to be good stewards of the earth and the championship and all of our partners and vendors encourage our fans to join us in this effort
8693198 im not considering moving the team im not considering selling it so i think that question at this time is

8693210 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8693211 hello that was a judgment of another woman based largely on her body and your own insecurity you hypocritical bitch why do you assume shes showing off and not that shes just getting down and having fun like you or like you would be doing if you werent judging other women and having this conversation with yourself dance
8693212 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8693213 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8693214 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8693215 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8693216 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8693217 the industry needs the old e3 back the sizzle is what sells and revealing new information with lasers and booth babes attracts more attention than showing off a game that is going to be released in two weeks
8693218 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8693219 i know this is being thought a lot about in washington and at the white house and discussed and i suspect they will monitor it carefully and figure out what to do
8693220 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8693221 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8693222 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8693223 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8693224 hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8693225 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8693226 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player i think hes matured greatly through this he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8693227 it certainly would make it very difficult to have contraflow and a football game
8693228 i dont think anyone would want us to play in that scenario
8693229 i wouldnt want to try and play in that situation but well know a lot more over the next couple of days
8693230 once that order is given its a huge impact on everything particularly if you have 120 000 people around tiger stadium and 92 000 in tiger stadium
8693231 well make a recommendation to lsu well be watching the storm very closely contraflow usually is not ordered unless a storm hits level three or higher
8693232 the storm could still change paths but we want to prepare for the worst and hope for the best
8693233 in reality time and date of landfall is subject to change and that time largely dictates when we order contraflow and that will largely dictate events like the football game and other events to see what might and might not be affected by contraflow
8693234 the general rule is to order start contraflow 30 hours before landfall
8693235 one of the elements in this is its heavily dependent on where it makes landfall so were going to look at it when we order contraflow when we order evacuations based on the latest information of where the storm is
8693236 it changed yesterday tuesday to today wednesday as late as tuesday they were predicting it would be here tuesday morning now theyre projecting monday morning landfall
8693237 we are absolutely keeping an eye on that when we get a better estimate on when landfall is when we get a better estimate of when were going to order contraflow we will look at that
8693238 we moved 1 5 million people before katrina beginning at 3 p m on that saturday aug 27 2005
8693239 contraflow impacts so many things and so many lives i dont want to speculate on what wed do with the football game well make a recommendation to lsu when the time comes

8693243 theres no need to discuss innocence or guilt we know hes guilty
8693244 the afghan central government created and installed essentially by the united states is really devastating the people of afghanistan theres rampant corruption theyre sucking away the aid theyre completely oppressing people theyre attacking journalists women are
8693245 and its true you really cant solve the situation in afghanistan by just throwing more troops at it because over the last several years tens of thousands of troops in afghanistan have not done have not managed to do anything other than worsen the war so basically what the logic is is that the war is going terribly the more troops we have the worse its getting so lets throw more troops to it the predictable outcome of this policy and you know i would love to get just half a minute of airtime with obama and tell him the predictable outcome of his policy is that you throw more troops at afghanistan and the war is just going to get worse the violence is just going to escalate its not going to ramp down how can you just what is he planning to do kill every last terrorist and then hes somehow going to win the war whats the plan here he doesnt even have a strategy he isnt even looking at the central government he is not looking at the corruption of the warlords he is not looking at hamid karzai and what he has failed to do hes not looking at how ordinary afghans are struggling he is not looking at the fact that the taliban are actually becoming more and more popular while the troops are becoming less and less popular
8693246 by analyzing a comprehensive roster of terrorist groups that existed worldwide between 1968 and 2006 the authors found that most groups ended because of operations carried out by local police or intelligence agencies or because they negotiated a settlement with their governments military force was rarely the primary reason a terrorist group ended and few groups within this time frame achieved victory these findings suggest that the u s approach to countering al qaida has focused far too much on the use of military force instead policing and intelligence should be the backbone of u s efforts
8693247 the opportunities that gorbachev created for international relations have also been missed perhaps even lost here however primarily because of the united states
8693248 president reagan negotiated the end of the cold war with soviet president gorbachev the neoconservatives whom reagan fired and drove from his administration were furious the neocons had hoped to win the cold war thereby establishing american hegemony the republican establishment reestablished its hegemony under bush 1st that it had lost to ronald reagan with this feat intelligence was driven from the republican party the neocons engineered their comeback with the first gulf war and their propaganda pure lies that iraqi troops bayoneted kuwait babies in hospitals the neocons made a further comeback with president clinton whom they convinced to bomb serbia in order to permit separatist movements to become independent states dependent on america with bush 2nd the neocons took over their agenda american world hegemony includes israeli hegemony in the middle east
8693249 i will tell you having visited israel just a month and a half ago their general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon my job as president would be to try to make sure we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that we mobilize the world community to go after irans nuclear program in a serious way we have to do it before israel feels its back is against the wall
8693250 i think you reserve impeachment for grave grave breaches and intentional breaches of the presidents authority i believe if we began impeachment proceedings we will be engulfed in more of the politics that has made washington dysfunction
8693251 we would once again rather than attending to the peoples business be engaged in a tit for tat back and forth non stop circus
8693252 there is a prima facie case that these actions by the president vice president and other members of the bush administration violated a number of federal laws including 1 committing a fraud against the united states 2 making false statements to congress 3 the war powers resolution 4 misuse of government funds 5 federal laws and international treaties prohibiting torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment 6 federal laws concerning retaliating against witnesses and other individuals 7 federal laws concerning leaking and other misuse of intelligence
8693253 the president vice president and all civil officers of the united states shall be removed from office on impeachment for and conviction of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors

8693275 when we met fashion was really at its dawn especially in italy
8693276 we built up our empire very gradually step by step thats what makes the brand strong the many years of hard effort behind it
8693277 the problem with fashion today is that so called empires are created in a very short time and can be cut down just as quickly

8693352 the first quarter proved to be a more difficult business environment than we anticipated a situation that we believe may continue throughout at least a portion of the remainder of our fiscal year our key products and technology continue to deliver compelling solutions but customers are experiencing softening demand in some of their end markets and we believe the first quarter results reflected delays in their purchases of design software as well as changes in our sales channel
8693353 given this assessment of market conditions and recent changes in our sales channel we lowered our full year guidance the new target is consistent with our intent to increase the portion of our revenue based on backlog to 90 percent or more of revenue in future periods

8693435 we are definitely noticing a significant downward trend in travel this year
8693436 but even as californians face steep increases in travel expenses they continue to put a high value on travel in their lives and find resources for quick getaways with family and friends
8693437 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8693438 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control
8693439 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors

8693518 shredding leaves and leaving them on the lawn is good for the grass and saves you time as the leaves break down they add organic matter to the soil improving drainage in clay soil and water holding ability in sandy soils its a great way to recycle a valuable natural resource and reduce your work load you can increase the environmental benefit even further by using an electric mower to both cut your grass and shred the leaves

8693552 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8693553 certainly the overall trend in the canadian labour market right now is fairly negative in the sense that a dramatic number of private sector jobs disappeared in the last month
8693554 and i think the sense is that things are likely going to get worse before they get better
8693555 theres a huge amount of variety within the service sector and unfortunately if you look at the past few labour force surveys a lot of the job creation has occurred in lower paying areas of the service sector
8693556 since the spring weve been essentially looking at a stalling out in hiring across canada reflecting a growing business concern over the u s slowdown and their sales prospects as well as high energy costs high material costs and the like
8693557 going forward we expect were probably going to still see continued or further softening in the job market into next year again reflecting a gradual slowdown in the north american economies
8693558 the manufacturing sector has historically been concentrated in ontario and quebec so any decline in the manufacturing sector sort of looms proportionally larger in those two provinces
8693559 every province has its day in the sun and in the near term i think the sun is going continue to shine on both western canada and to some extent some regions in atlantic canada where energy projects are important
8693560 theres nothing new about changes in the composition of the canadian workforce weve in the past seen huge shifts from farm work to other sources of employment weve had other industries come and go
8693561 flexibility in both the type of work you do and where you go to do it is the key to re deploying canadian workers who have been displaced
8693562 ultimately what needs to happen is more jobs need to be created
8693563 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8693564 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8693565 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8693566 the volunteers have been deployed to assist the passengers weve got our food providers helping them out with snacks and stuff to try and make the best of a very challenging situation for them
8693567 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
8693568 the deformer describes what warps you what deforms you into you are
8693569 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do

8693571 many publicly traded companies that fail to file on a timely basis are shell companies and as such are attractive vehicles for fraudulent stock manipulation schemes
8693572 that is his blessing god has a big dream for your life
8693573 i would think that our message would have increased relevancy in a time of economic uncertainty i think people want to know that god is taking care of you as it gets darker i think the brighter message shines
8693574 its gods will for you to live in prosperity instead of poverty its gods will for you to pay your bills and not be in debt its gods will for you to live in health and not in sickness all the days of your life
8693575 on the basketball court guys would take a look at joel and say ill guard him and then joel would go right by them

8693578 my dad didnt have it in him he just wouldnt feel comfortable with that
8693579 he was very uncomfortable in public he always loved being behind the scenes
8693580 i dont know if its six literal days or 6 million years
8693581 the accessibility of my message doesnt bother me a bit look we deal with people who are fighting cancer fighting to save their marriages dealing with the death of loved ones i dont think they need to be beaten down and i think the success of the message in the marketplace is because we are optimistic encouraging
8693582 oprah has a brand nike has a brand and joel osteen has a brand joel has made his brand the inspiration brand
8693583 joel is a level 5 leader he knows there is more than one way to get to a point and he lets his people get to the point their way hes a true level 5 great delegator great empowerer great big picture thinker
8693584 joel made the decision to do it right the first time we gutted the place and started over
8693585 cutting back on airtime would be like saying we wont be sending any trucks to deliver our product
8693586 were always looking for ways to get our message out there more efficiently in that way were no different from any other big brand a coke or a starbucks

8693589 very rarely will you find a company that produces a widget where everyone is mentally and spiritually into producing a better widget

8693596 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8693597 it helped me remember helped me look in on the wreckage of my past
8693598 id always said id never write a book like this
8693599 turns the traditional memoir on its head assuming as it does that its author knows nothing about his own life and must research it as though it were someone elses
8693600 an exercise in self indulgent narcissism what a waste of talent energy and professional competence
8693601 his idea is that i should write a big long book about my glorious media career
8693602 and he and about four other people would read that
8693603 she had pushed me back out of her life once and she didnt really feel a need to have me back in i think she thought the book idea was stupid
8693604 i like her and she likes me but its just weird really weird
8693605 how about that scab you have on you from you know 20 years ago
8693606 he did some outrageous things and he did some horrible things and yet thats not who he is but thats what drugs will do to you
8693607 but it was not a one tissue affair i continued the interview with a huge wad up one nostril my head filling with blood as i struggled to finish
8693608 if someone had lit a truth candle and the governor had asked me why my nose was bleeding i would have said it was because i had been sticking things up it all night long
8693609 i hated being a bad father i couldnt stand that and theres nothing in my upbringing to allow for that
8693610 ive told people i expected him to be dead in the 1988 89 era
8693611 wasnt born like a bratty kid or a wiseguy or a troublemaker
8693612 i just had a specific instance with a specific sort of allergy to mood altering chemicals that by the way you know probably 20 30 40 million americans have so its not that uncommon i just sort of took it to uncommon ends
8693613 ive always thought it the times was a magnificent thing to read and look at i just never pictured the likes of me working here
8693614 when they called it was total bolt out of the blue
8693615 set out to become a nice suburban alcoholic and succeeded
8693616 like a b horror flick that was scheduled to run continuously for days
8693617 it helped me remember helped me look in on the wreckage of my past and i really havent had a thirsty day since i started working on it
8693618 the important thing is making a good start we took one point from the first three games last season and weve got to do better
8693619 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8693620 we know it wont be easy but we know liverpool from p laying them last year that could be an advantage for us but also for them
8693621 romanian football has come on a lot and fiorentina were semi finalists in last seasons uefa cup and had a good season in italy well have to get points pretty much everywhere
8693622 hey i am trying but do you see what i am up against
8693623 they are going to be fantastic games the rivalry is there between scotland and england we played against them a couple of years ago and got a victory it promises to be a great atmosphere in both games
8693624 our home form is very good its just our away form that has been very poor if we can get that right it will go a long way to getting through to the next round
8693625 we dont have to travel far and the fixtures have fallen nicely weve got a home game against villarreal inbetween the games against liverpool and chelsea
8693626 i remember the last game at celtic distinctly they beat us to qualify and the atmosphere from their fans was unbelievable they will be two huge games
8693627 its a big one we seem to make a habit of drawing the european champions
8693628 weve had man utd ac milan and barcelona three years in a row theres no free passes in europe but its great for the fans
8693629 wouldnt it be fabulous if we could get through and meet united later on in the competition
8693630 with our spanish contingent that will be a couple of very big games and there will be a lot of attention focused on those
8693631 theyve got some very good players and if theres one team in the last pot we didnt want to sign it was them
8693632 we know all of the teams quite well for different reasons
8693633 if you come down to the training ground you will see the boys are totally focused on the champions league
8693634 we have always been the bridesmaids weve been to four semi finals and a final we want to go one better this year
8693635 its an interesting draw a bit of mixed bag the romanian team is interesting because im not aware of them well have to do our homework
8693636 one of the issues for arsene is the distances we have to travel
8693637 le fait est que les citoyens am ricains se trouvaient vraiment dans la zone de conflit pendant les hostilit s il devrait tre admis quils taient l apr s avoir re u des ordres de leurs sup rieurs
8693638 par cons quent ils ont agi en ex cutant ces ordres et le seul qui peut donner de tels ordres cest leur dirigeant
8693639 laisser entendre que les etats unis ont orchestr cela pour le compte dun candidat politique cela ne semble pas rationnel
8693640 si jai bien compris cela laisse penser que quelquun aux etats unis a cr ce conflit sp cialement pour que la situation empire et pour cr er un avantage en faveur de lun des candidats dans la course serr e au poste de pr sident des etats unis
8693641 ces accusations sont videmment fausses une fois pour toutes mais il semble aussi que ses responsables de la d fense qui ont dit croire que c tait vrai lui donnent vraiment de mauvais conseils

8693684 despu s de accra cuando nos volvamos a encontrar en poznan polonia en diciembre pr cticamente tendremos delante la primera versi n del texto de negociaciones
8693685 los gobiernos empiezan a implicarse seriamente en las negociaciones que tendr n que llegar a un resultado en copenhague
8693686 las personas tendr n tiempo de reflexionar sobre lo que ellos consideran como los principales ingredientes que deben figurar en el acuerdo de copenhague se nota el sentimiento de urgencia ya que nos queda poco m s de un a o para conseguirlo
8693687 hemos identificado a pa ses innovadores como noruega suiza o corea pero la uni n europea ue est perdiendo el liderazgo y se ha atascado en las discusiones sobre la diferenciaci n
8693688 la multitud que esperamos es un indicador de la campa a que ha desarrollado el senador obama desde el inicio el cambio ocurre de abajo hacia arriba
8693689 en realidad luego de que la gente se vaya de que los fuegos artificiales estallen la pregunta permanece qu es lo que queda y es sta una persona preparada para ser presidente de estados unidos
8693690 har un esfuerzo para lograr la unidad en esas localidades y as ponernos de acuerdo una cosa es la unidad y otra es el candidato nico sin embargo la unidad es lo que representa el inter s colectivo

8693773 looking back at the custom bike world it was such a contrast it was almost nauseating so experiencing the performance world made me want to build a bike that could balance both worlds
8693774 about two years ago i planned this machine and built it to do things its like late 50s early 60s sort of caf racer crossed with modern custom sports bike but with modern techno harley and a lot of high tech thrown in this simple little sketch that i made on an airplane it was a bike that had a look to it it was also a look that no one had really delved into before
8693775 it runs just a front cylinder and where the cylinder of the v sits i run the supercharger harleys themselves are fun to work with but to take half of one was even a bigger challenge theres something fun in making a machine go fast that really is not supposed to i figured it would either be a grenade or wed get it to work quite well
8693776 we barely start with any factory parts at all its building a bike from a clean sheet of paper on this motorcycle everything from the kickstand to the frame all the body is all hand made the wheels are specially made the hubs for instance i started with 96 pounds of aluminum material and manually machined it down to an 18 pound hub i mean youre building everything
8693777 the industry has had a lot of negative exposure most notably the show orange county not to slam them they do their thing and they have their place but they will never really be considered bike builders its entertainment its an alternative to watching temptation island its not about bike building its not about informing or educating or showing people how things are done its about silly drama thats a whole different thing and we dont like to be associated with that in any way
8693778 part of it is i didnt really push it because thats not how i roll i always sort of had this idea that this is my work and if you like it great if people pick up on it thats awesome and if not thats fine too i let my work speak for itself and thats worked for me im really not the self promotion kinda guy

8693844 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8693845 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8693846 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price

8693867 i feel of the original five x men with the possible exception of angel iceman is the one whos been most inconsistently developed
8693868 every so often hed just default back to being the joker the wisecracker and the rookie which he empathically isnt hes got as much combat experience as cyclops and beast he deserves to have that reflected in the way hes portrayed so in the adjectiveless x men title and other places ive been playing with bobbys character developing his powers and personality and trying to move him into the place where i think he ought to be
8693869 you obviously have the problem though that if you make one of the heroes in a book too powerful you skew the story dynamics to a certain extent but with iceman its possible to explore some of the ramifications of his powers a lot further before you get to that point
8693870 hes devastatingly honest he is very up front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time
8693871 also hes obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes
8693872 i think its fair to say that hes haunted by the recent past and has got something to prove in the events leading up to messiah complex he got blindsided by mystique and i think thats still preying on him to a large extent
8693873 so were definitely revisiting some of those events bobby is questioning his role as a member of the x men and contemplating his trip west to san francisco but hes not entirely sure what his next move is going to be
8693874 it will be by road by air and a variety of other means
8693875 its forty pages total so you can kind of see it as a two issue limited series doing it as five episodes though allows us to really punctuate the journey
8693876 each episode is in a different place a different part of america as iceman gradually moves west
8693877 the plot of the story brings bobby face to face with an old enemy somebody who he is perhaps ill prepared to meet at this point in his life
8693878 so it becomes kind of a duel to the death across the face of america with bobbys future as an x man and his very identity at stake
8693879 id rather not be too specific about this villains motives because theres a sense that the character in question is not being entirely honest on that score
8693880 the villains state of mind is just as fractured and conflicted as bobbys
8693881 hes got a great sensitivity to visual storytelling and the ability to handle raw emotion which is very much called for here
8693882 i like beast because he embodies contradictions hes this very intelligent educated and cultured man in the body of a wild animal that sort of dichotomy always fascinated me
8693883 i had always loved the character and i think his is one of the more interesting and bizarre origin stories among the x men i thought it bore revisiting and retelling
8693884 hes still at senior high and emotionally hes in hiding
8693885 hes in hiding from his powers who he is and who he fears he may he turn out to be
8693886 were showing what this means to hank in terms of his mental state and the mental state of his adversary in the story the conquistador
8693887 it deepens the situation in that respect it doesnt change the major beats but you could argue that it gives a different sense of what the major beats mean for everyone involved
8693888 when he was first introduced he was just a guy who dressed up as an armored spanish soldier from the 17th century
8693889 apart from them the other supporting players are hanks family and his first girlfriend jennifer nyles
8693890 at this time shes the love of his life and she has her own part to play in the transformation that he goes through
8693891 it really is amazing theres a splash page towards the end which is hanks first meeting with the x men and oh man youve just got to see it to believe it

8693928 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care

8693959 with snap we have the ability to populate approximately 60 to 70 percent of the information we need to process a workers compensation application with the touch of a button

8693962 when an agent is looking to place say a 5 000 10 000 or 15 000 piece of business it will either hit our sweet spot or not and were not going to waste either the agents time or ours
8693963 we just take the information from the expiring policy populate a new template within snap and put it through our rating algorithm with the new loss and payroll information
8693964 we estimate that it will shorten that process by 150 man hours per week

8693991 friday of last week we had seven calls for work to be done and we turned them all down
8693992 i dont like it at all but we just cant keep people waiting we try to tell them to try someone else or give us a call back see if we can squeeze them in
8693993 people are saying theyre paying at least 25 per cent more for heating costs this year
8693994 hopefully the bill will be a lot lower just to be able to save a bit of money or to be able to break even with everything
8693995 these ads arent exactly porn but they cross the business journalism decorum code i believe
8693996 the republican party platform committee has released a platform that contains some of the strongest pro life language in the history of the party looking at bioethics issues it also strengthens the language on stem cell research by calling for a ban on not just funding of it but of the unethical science in general
8693997 health officials attribute the citys relatively high rate of new infections to its large populations of gay men blacks and other groups on whom hiv has traditionally taken a heavy toll
8693998 the university of michigan law school has announced it will pay 5 000 to second year law students who intern with qualified government or public interest groups
8693999 i think right after that well be ready to get going
8694000 i wouldnt think so just the way it has been but who knows
8694001 once youre in the batting practice arena youre getting very close
8694002 hes got good command of his off speed stuff hes moved fairly quickly through our system and people have been real high on him
8694003 in the last 30 days ive used 12gb not abusive for an unlimited account in my estimation
8694004 i mentioned i didnt see youtube as a streaming service the way the internet is now its almost impossible to avoid multimedia
8694005 these are not typical or normal users their activities are placing extreme demands on the network that are simply way beyond reasonable
8694006 as we contacted those customers we found that some were well aware that they were violating the terms of service and were not surprised to get a call from us just like the wired internet we know that some abusers employ a strategy of moving from carrier to carrier and abusing the services until they get caught
8694007 they also tend to be the most vocal on online blogs claiming that their rights have been violated
8694008 we were educated by customers by what they wanted and we were educated by customers by what they used
8694009 customers want to have some tools to give themselves predictable costs
8694010 you know those stories out there every now and then you hear about them that are really poor terrible customer experiences where somebodys got a five figure data bill because their kid went and watched movies or something where they werent sure of the data usage thats not going to happen
8694011 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8694012 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8694013 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8694014 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8694015 hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8694016 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8694017 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player i think hes matured greatly through this he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8694018 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8694019 even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8694020 they certainly owe lots to the calgary airport authority and we understand to other airports across the country
8694021 we always love to draw the champion of europe as we did last year with
8694022 all of those things add up to good things and get us to the next round again theyre going to be fantastic games
8694023 with fernando and the other spanish players there will be huge huge interest in that one
8694024 its great thats what makes the champions league so exciting its fantastic
8694025 the other thing i would say about our brands is that they have faced world wars they have faced revolutions they have faced more economic cycles than we will see and they are today faster more profitable and appealing to more customers than ever before
8694026 inevitably the companys outlook for 2009 is rather less bullish and the ongoing rise in commodity costs could yet erode some of its operating margins
8694027 nonetheless the company is well positioned to withstand slowing economic growth
8694028 people are not necessarily drinking more but are wanting to drink better
8694029 theres still this nucleus of consumers that can access the best and want to do so
8694030 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8694031 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8694032 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8694033 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8694034 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8694035 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8694036 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8694037 freezers tend to be countercyclical meaning that they generally do better when the economy is soft because people go out less and buy groceries in bulk
8694038 this offer represents the best package of pay and benefits in the aerospace industry
8694039 at the same time its a contract offer that allows our company to meet its commitments to customers and sustain our success into the future
8694040 the 2 percent increase in total u s store sales was also more than entirely due to higher spending by customers from other countries
8694041 sales to new yorkers were below last year which should not be too surprising to anyone
8694042 even though the u s was weaker than expected i think a lot of investors thought that could happen
8694043 we have grown our canadian store base where we are achieving much higher returns on capital and the economy is much healthier than we currently find in the u s
8694044 for the second time in three years a massive storm is threatening to scuttle southern decadence
8694045 for those who believe no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe no explanation is possible
8694046 youtube has quickly become embedded in the worlds digital culture
8694047 the usta looks forward to distributing entertaining content to an expanded global audience through this new tennis themed interactive youtube channel
8694048 im older than ive ever been and now im even older and now im even older and now im even older
8694049 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8694050 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as today we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8694051 the collapse of zoom is a result of matter beyond our control only last year zoom airlines made profit but that turned into a loss in the last year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8694052 the price of oil resulted in our fuel bill jumping by nearly 50 million in one year and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked their flights

8694065 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8694066 we like to provide as many services as possible for free we already provide our network access for gameplay for free and the interesting thing about the network side and the internet business is that theres a variety of revenue sources
8694067 not necessarily getting people to pay but with advertising and so on
8694068 those are things were looking at and learning how we can provide a service without people having to pay but we still get our operation running with funding from somewhere so that we can maintain the level of quality we want
8694069 bite sized and short so you can grind them and play them and get faster and faster its not like playing an entire level
8694070 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8694071 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8694072 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad its very dangerous and a mistaken policy
8694073 it that was the case then the recent events could have a american domestic political dimension
8694074 if my suspicions are confirmed in that case the suspicion arises that somebody in the united states has intentionally created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8694075 if that was the case its nothing less than the use of so called administrative resources in a domestic political fight in its worst bloody dimension
8694076 today it is essential that the eu speaks with one voice that is strong and firm on the georgian conflict
8694077 the hope that this crisis will simply pass and that we can go back to business as usual is very naive
8694078 it is utopian to think of a partnership agreement with russia now if georgias territorial integrity is not guaranteed then were thrown back 40 years
8694079 i highly doubt it might ever happen it would be more to the detriment of the eu than to russia
8694080 i am not a fan of sanctions now is the time for talks but we should have concrete moves in our pocket
8694081 poland will want the eu summit to make the commitment to ukraine and the caucasus states as tangible as possible
8694082 they will think it is the only guarantee against the potential threat posed by russia

8694085 i heard him remind my red state that there is no such thing as a democrat way or republican way to build strong families that work and personal responsibility are democratic standards too and this above all i heard obama tell my state to sustain our voters but an american value
8694086 we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators not the canadian food safety system
8694087 i emphasize this is our accountability and its ours to fix which we are taking on fully
8694088 we have an inspector in place on a daily basis when the plant is running in order to oversee the production process in order to validate that the controls are indeed in place
8694089 its tantamount to if you had a haystack with a needle in it you can walk out and take 10 samples of that haystack you likely wont find the needle what adds value is address what caused the needle getting in there in the first place

8694101 we found no evidence that either of the two treatments was superior to the other in the prevention of recurrent stroke
8694102 even though in science you always strive to find a superior treatment in this case it gives us options for treatment depending on the patient and their response to the different medications
8694103 furthermore there was no significant difference between the two treatments in the risk of fatal or disabling strokes

8694117 i could see a length of what i remember being orange and white plastic and what looked like an orange stopper it was a syringe
8694118 she was holding it up in front of her chest it was tucked in rather than held out
8694119 i was aware there was drug use and i was aware what that needle could be
8694120 she was pointing the syringe upwards then whipped it behind her back

8694174 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8694175 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8694176 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8694177 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8694178 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8694179 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts

8694218 the challenge is to make sure you get 10 points as quick as you can i think we have the squad for it
8694219 we always love to draw the champion of europe as we did last year with fc barcelona
8694220 all of those things add up to good things and get us to the next round again theyre going to be fantastic games
8694221 you cant begin to think youre the favorite when you see teams like milan barcelona juventus all these great names
8694222 weve got a big squad and were going to need that with the amount of games weve got this season
8694223 the way the games have fallen means our first game is at home to villarreal between our trips to liverpool and chelsea which is good
8694224 kiev and fenerbahce are long trips that is the real issue for us
8694225 its a difficult group because we are playing the best team in the world
8694226 chelsea certainly has a leg up on the other teams in the group but we have to count on the hard work that we have done in the past few years
8694227 with fernando and the other spanish players there will be huge huge interest in that one
8694228 its great thats what makes the champions league so exciting its fantastic

8694245 these privileged identities which lie on hundreds of servers and applications very rarely get changed as it is often considered too much hassle when people leave the organisation they can often still access the network using these passwords to acquire an organisations most sensitive information
8694246 you can install the best security systems in the world but if your staff do not respect the information they are entrusted with then the information will definitely go astray just as the findings of this survey have illustrated

8694252 the last time we came here for some reason i played a weakened team
8694253 we had a lot of reserves in our line up as we had a monday game to follow against
8694254 when i saw lazio celebrating as if they had won the world cup i thought that wont happen again
8694255 the game tomorrow is extremely important we did not realise that a few years ago
8694256 there are no league games to distract us so there is no excuse this time
8694257 we need to go out and get the victory as this is a prestigious game and one we want to win there is a great incentive for us
8694258 fabio will need players who are 100 fit to play a game of that nature against croatia
8694259 owen will not be ready as he needs recovery time as well as getting down to training
8694260 it has not been easy for him having tendinitis can be irritating for a player
8694261 but he has trained for 10 days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch
8694262 what he is doing there is fantastic the dutch have always been travellers in football and do not mind coaching anywhere
8694263 that is a great asset to have dick for his part has been in places as far apart as glasgow and st petersburg
8694264 when he was in charge of holland he was one of the best at understanding the dilemma of a club manager
8694265 he has proved to be a successful and competent coach you just have to look at his record with zenit
8694266 zenit were the best team in the competition they overcame leverkusen and bayern munich on the way as well
8694267 you tend to take notice of of results like that and their attacking play captured a lot of peoples attention
8694268 the two superpowers that faced each other across the wall of this city came too close too often to destroying all we have built and all that we love
8694269 in the recent tradition of african american secretaries of state colin powell and condoleezza rice
8694270 i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
8694271 we have a very talented and dedicated group of students who are ready and able to tackle the fundamental chemistry problems that must be solved before it will be feasible to produce clean solar fuels on a large scale
8694272 we already have several industrial partners and we intend to add more as we want to move the new materials and processes invented by our center into the commercial arena as rapidly as possible
8694273 these transformations will require the development of new models for understanding multiple electron and proton transfer reactions and catalyst design
8694274 i strongly support chemistrys cbc program as a way to tackle grand challenge problems with potentially transformative societal impacts such as sustainable energy the nocera work and the powering the planet center is an excellent example of this
8694275 u s foreign policy is akin to government sponsored terrorism these days it was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on september 11 last year i am solo i will continue to disrupt at the highest levels
8694276 through a quirk of the metric system this becomes 60 years 70 years and a life sentence in the british press
8694277 as gadgets get smaller the tradeoffs become more difficult the balance becomes more critical and theres less room for error
8694278 im not surprised its happening to the nano because thats the small one youre asking it do a lot in a very very small package and thats pushing the envelope
8694279 when you have a constant change in the devices i think you have less room to prove designs
8694280 thats more of an issue especially with portable devices because the changes are not let me move this from there the changes are always radical
8694281 what were noticing now is less the idea of miniaturization but more so the idea of lifestyle optimization
8694282 right now were at the point where technology can be more or less be any size the focus is miniaturization in just the right spot to hit the perfect balance between comfortable interaction and pocketability
8694283 anything that is new definitely opens itself up to more risk but without risk theres no reward
8694284 we designers like to push limits as much as possible and there has to be due diligence in testing but if you sit there and test and test and test you lose the chance to be innovative

8694304 im going to pax because i think it will be fun to meet cool people who share similar interests and the chance to possibly get to talk to some industry folks
8694305 the sizzle is what sells and revealing new information with lasers and booth babes attracts more attention than showing off a game that is going to be released in two weeks
8694306 the type of content at pax isnt much different than the content we had at the first show in 2004

8694309 it was all pre recorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8694310 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8694311 its nothing to do with priorities or which orchestra is better it was decided to split the work between the two orchestras
8694312 its quite a normal practice and if the olympics had been in melbourne the sydney symphony would have been involved im sure of that
8694313 i have been working consistently as a strong feminist to someday hope that we could elect a woma president of the united states and i thought this was the year i threw myself into it totally in my heart and my mind i had to vote for her for closure

8694315 with 40 or so years in the novelty distribution business there is no denying that williams trading co is one of the most well respected distributors in the country
8694316 it is a tremendous boost of confidence to both our company and our customers that such a well known distributor recognizes the quality and value which set our products apart from the competition
8694317 the response weve received since the launch of our catalog back in april has been overwhelming
8694318 its great to see that after all of our research and dedication to producing quality products many long time industry veterans now recognize us as one of todays leading novelties manufacturers
8694319 from the time i landed i did so much from the royal palace to the end of the world i took pictures for the media everywhere id like to thank wicked and erotikknett no for allowing me to travel to such an amazing place to meet so many fans when i danced at the show friday and saturday in front of thousands it was a dream come true and i think they enjoyed it as much as i did i look forward to next year

8694329 there is a tremendous focus on it in the research community
8694330 on a positive note 66 percent of all vulnerabilities identified have been remediated underscoring the value of a consistent web site vulnerability management program
8694331 it should be noted however that the frequency with which security issues are reported does not reflect the frequency of their distribution in the wild
8694332 for example cross site scripting comprised roughly 23 percent of the total application vulnerability volume yet this vulnerability is very common in proprietary web applications
8694333 attacking client side applications or browser plug ins is increasingly becoming a means for distributing malware rootkits and backdoors

8694339 joe i dont know why team america the best team in the world would select this guy to play quarterback
8694340 youre right jack his track record shows what appears to be an unwillingness to move the ball down field
8694341 the last thing team america needs when it takes the field is a quarterback who cant get the ball past the 50 yard line

8694344 the georgian broadcaster is also not sure that russia can guarantee the safety of all participants according to the new portal of the estonian broadcaster err
8694345 from our angle russia cannot guarantee the safety of our representatives and perhaps the safety of participants from other countries either maybe this is a good example for the whole world if you think about the situation to think about the russian aggression
8694346 spontaneous decisions might aggravate the efforts of diplomats to harmonize the conflict it is not right time to speak about that
8694347 you cannot ignore what has happened to georgians under the russian amp ossetian army it is a moral issue which no matter how it effects the contest should not be ignored

8694349 there has been much written about vancouver canada being a great city this british columbian city has been ranked the number one city in a row by the economist magazine survey here are 5 reasons why it ranks high from a cooltown prospective 1 its walkable smart growth principles have been in place for decades the city council even prevented the construction of freeways in the 1980s i can remember the first time visiting and being annoyed having to drive through the downtown to get to whistler now i realize that s the same reason the downtown is full of activity 2 it s free lifestyle two examples of this would be the clothing optional wreck beach conventially located within walking distance to ubc and the decimalization of marijuana in canada its a fact nothing more nothing less i was at a conference at ubc and afterwards took a walk down to wreck beach we then proceeded to get naked go swimming and watch a great sunset while there i saw a guy in a suit walk down get naked smoke a then go swimming that was a very vancouver moment 3 its large gay lesbian community often referred to as the san francisco of the north growing up there the gay community was just part of the city as simple as that 4 attainably priced housing vancouver housing is expensive so the city government encourages legalized secondary suites and cooperative housing i know a few friends who live in co ops downtown if the government did not step in they could not live the urban life they do 5 extensive street car system started in 1890 it is being upgraded with the canadaline that will link the airport with many spots in the downtown area i can remember growing up and one of the first signs of maturity is if you knew the bus system my high school friends would wear it like a badge of honor i also remember taking the skytrain all over to go skateboarding it s a great feeling to be young and not stuck at home
8694350 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8694351 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8694352 chunk was a big cat with a large bone structure he looked very fat but could carry his weight well
8694353 and he only came up in the mid 20 pound range
8694354 hes going to live longer and its gonna be easier to get the remaining weight off him
8694355 i own a 22 pounder and mine looks like a waify thing compared to chunk
8694356 but i cant imagine that the animal lost that much weight
8694357 and we were ready for a 44 pound cat hes only 22 youve seen the pictures can you imagine a cat twice that size
8694358 the cow she thinks shes a dog so shes interested in everything
8694359 the dude was facing her on his knees like he was praying
8694360 she shared everything she brought food to people sometimes i would see her out playing dominos with her kids she had one person in her life that was her man
8694361 he was calm he was not the type to do this kind of thing
8694362 this is the festival to get into to present your work
8694363 in 12 years weve championed a large group of artists
8694364 weve consistently given them a platform weve enabled them to find legs
8694365 the arts community in philadelphia becomes part of an international community
8694366 enriches our work here because our work feeds into other experiences
8694367 it creates a lot of buzz in the city and theres an urgency to seeing the pieces
8694368 allows me to see shows at an inexpensive price or a reasonable one and i get to choose from a lot of different dramatic offerings
8694369 the opportunity to see new work its exciting what an amazing arts community
8694370 the idea is to take a chance its not always going to be great and its not always going to be memorable but it is always interesting
8694371 created a vibe for a mainstream audience to see the work we do
8694372 you can feel normal taking a risk and checking out unusual stuff you may not know you already like
8694373 the fringe is a whole other way to get people involved in a conversation about art
8694374 at other festivals i saw that what people really wanted each night was to just be together at a place where they could talk
8694375 to do your own thing thats the spirit of the fringe
8694376 the sophistication and the willingness to push the envelope i find that very attractive
8694377 the most important thing whether youre talking about a business or youre talking about a city is innovation you want to create a climate of innovation
8694378 the shows we make are being seen by the national and international community and taken to theaters and festivals worldwide
8694379 so many of us in philadelphia are cross disciplinary so you might be designing one persons show and performing in another persons
8694380 the festival means pushing ourselves youre encouraged to do risky work to go out on a limb and you get to see a whole range of different people taking risks nick stuccio has given us such an international face
8694381 look for me at the rally ill be the bald guy in a a flight jacket
8694382 what better place to gather people of all nationalities and people who are history lovers
8694383 you just have that feeling that sen obama is going to deliver something pretty powerful this evening
8694384 we can withstand a light sprinkle thing but we just cant protect the whole mall
8694385 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8694386 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8694387 those are questions for the mccain campaign and i think they are going to make their announcement shortly
8694388 this stop snitchin is going to be the end of us all if we continue to let it run our city
8694389 fear is not an option dont let me see you do it com
8694390 a lot of people think this snitchin theme affects only certain areas
8694391 its not just north phillys problem its not just west phillys problem its everybodys problem no one should dismiss the fact that this is going on
8694392 these kids dont understand that death is permanent death is real
8694393 thats when i saw the difference between dead ends and roads that continue through life
8694394 you can walk three blocks and find just about any drug you want
8694395 theres a group that says dont snitch this is the opposite of that if you do it and i see you do it im telling its as simple as that i dont want to go to a funeral were trying to deter this stuff from getting into our neighborhood
8694396 then the neighborhood gets taken over at that point you have an uphill battle
8694397 we need to get more involved in ending this snitchin concept so many lives have ended and weve seemed to reverse our values theres no honor in this code just chaos
8694398 ofrenda de la mujer a la heroica ciudad por sus 79 a os de retorno al suelo peruano
8694399 la contralor a ha pedido una nueva precisi n al mef en una carta que hemos recibido el d a lunes y ya la hemos transmitido al ministerio esperamos que tengamos esa respuesta entre hoy o ma ana viernes
8694400 ese proyecto tiene un enorme impacto social porque beneficiar a m s de 3 000 nuevas localidades ya que acceder an a los servicios de telecomunicaciones y podr a involucrarse a m s de tres millones de peruanos quienes se van a incorporar a las comunicaciones porque hoy no tienen comunicaci n telef nica ni acceso a internet
8694401 esto lo estamos trabajando aceleradamente con el ministerio y el organismo supervisor de la inversi n en energ a y miner a osinergmin para poder lanzar el proceso y entregar la concesi n de algunas de las cuatro nuevas l neas
8694402 tambi n estamos trabajando en el estudio del gasoducto macrorregional del sur aunque el mem eval a otorgar la concesi n por propuesta directa de dos empresas privadas kuntur transportadora de gas y energy transfer y esperamos que el ministerio lo pueda definir en setiembre

8694404 nuestros campos cumplen las exigencias de la fifa pero no est n en buenas condiciones algunos ni siquiera tienen gradas para el p blico que ven los partidos detr s de una valla met lica
8694405 los clubes no tienen fuentes de financiaci n fijas hemos conseguido el patrocinio de 22 empresas y tenemos que ajustarnos al escaso presupuesto para cubrir todas las necesidades
8694406 el equipo de nabl s tarda m s de cuatro horas en llegar al campo de jeric a pesar de estar a unos 50 kil metros de distancia
8694407 algo que no hac a en los ltimos a os
8694408 demuestra que hay una palestina que existe una palestina que quiere vivir y que est m s all de la muerte y los asesinatos que provoca la ocupaci n
8694409 con el transcurrir del tiempo y con el incremento de las actividades en el transporte observamos que algunos malos empresarios han migrado sus conductas informales ya no a las que identificamos inicialmente sino hacia la exigencia a sus choferes a exceder la jornada de trabajo permitida
8694410 se tuvo xito en ambas medidas pero hay que tener en cuenta la informalidad en el transporte es lamentablemente din mico que cambia de forma y genera nuevos problemas
8694411 lamentablemente hecha la ley hecha la trampa y tenemos que abocarnos a encontrar nuevas formas en las cuales se presentan los incumplimientos
8694412 el informe de la cvr sienta las bases para la reconciliaci n entre los peruanos
8694413 la guerra en georgia fue provocada desde ee uu para favorecer a mccain
8694414 era importante para el nuevo sistema de schalke la presencia de sus dos nuevos jales orlando engelaar y jefferson farf n ambos tienen condiciones pero ir nicamente estos dos jugadores resultaron heridos en madrid
8694415 las ausencias de farf n y engelaar apuraron m s el fracaso de schalke en la liga de campeones
8694416 that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
8694417 has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
8694418 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8694419 as a christian for me as a christian its also a sacred union
8694420 equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
8694421 my little boy is austic and hasnt spoken for five years
8694422 the text was obscured without any explanation as to why
8694423 our suspicions were confirmed by staff who told us that following a complaint from a single religious fundamentalist the museum had been instructed to cover up the offending statement
8694424 by this action the council would appear to be endorsing the views of a religious minority and denying the right of the rest of us to see the results of rational and scientific thought
8694425 evolution is not an extreme view not to be mentioned in respectable
8694426 its particularly sad that in the 21st century we appear to have a council with 19th century attitudes
8694427 id be interested to hear how the council justifies this censorship and who ordered the cover up
8694428 preferably they should reinstate the complete panel immediately if they havent got the courage to do this they should at least put up a statement telling all that they have a policy of allowing censorship by religious minorities
8694429 our museum team covered part of a display board following a complaint about a small section of the wording
8694430 the team agreed the wording was poorly worded and could cause offence we took the decision to obscure part of it rather than spend tax payers money on a replacement
8694431 the team agreed the wording was poorly worded and could cause offence
8694432 normally when people come on a dig they will find something but to find a large tylosaur like this its pretty rare

8694434 the road was constructed between 1970 and 1974 as a north south crossing at the historical border between transylvania and wallachia it came as a response to the 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia by the soviet union ceausescu wanted to insure quick military access across the mountains in the event the soviets attempted a similar move into romania consequently the road was built mainly with military forces at a high cost both financially and from a human standpoint roughly 6 million kilograms of dynamite were used on the northern face and about 40 soldiers lost their lives in building accidents
8694435 ok i figured that part out for myself but thank you what else
8694436 um power maintenance you know what else can you tell me

8694441 classic philly motown and 70s black disco meets the creativity of the beatles and bob dylan it just felt to me that a lot of stuff out there sounds the same its a time for change for something else

8694448 there were years where you need binoculars to see the outfielders they were playing so deep

8694464 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8694465 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8694466 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
8694467 this suggests that stressful events do not protect us from the effect of additional events and even moderate or mild events seem to have a cumulative effect
8694468 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8694469 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8694470 we continue to believe that association could reflect real contamination early on
8694471 it is information that is more restricted in time and does not have confirmatory laboratory findings behind it
8694472 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below

8694475 i dont want to steer the documentary in any direction at all id rather present all the evidence and let people make up their own minds
8694476 music plays an integral part in action sports games and we wanted to provide the right background to complement the nonstop spectacular tricks and massive jumps in the game
8694477 we feel that the songs weve included on the soundtrack are ideal to round out the adrenaline rush players will get while playing pure

8694498 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 over the last four years in comparison with aids related deaths we had in 2003 to 2004 because of increased free treatment
8694499 this represents a 67 survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition

8694503 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8694504 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8694505 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process
8694506 this suggests the exciting possibility that mef2 proteins may control expression of key genes that modulate drug related brain changes and behavior
8694507 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes
8694508 some insured patients are being asked by hospitals to pay larger portions of their bills upfront and sometimes hospitals will not do the procedures until they get their copayments
8694509 can be withheld depending on a patients ability to pay
8694510 as the economy worsens employers are having a harder time affording insurance for their employees theyre increasing the patient portions and patients benefits actually decrease
8694511 scaled up response for making available affordable treatments and control
8694512 was the center of the greater new orleans safety net system for the past 269 years and the dominant source of care for the indigent population serving 63 percent of the uninsured
8694513 katrina revealed some ugly truths about our nations failure to care for its citizens in the wake of a natural disaster
8694514 and we are still not prepared today we need a national healthcare system that has the capability of stepping in at the time of impact and providing the healthcare services needed
8694515 there were out of network claims that were not paid accurately

8694518 there has been silence on the domestic side about hiv aids
8694519 still see hiv aids as an epidemic that is affecting people in this country particularly minorities
8694520 at a point where weve had a great deal of experience with hiv aids
8694521 some things that we know work well there are some things we need to modify and change and there are some things we just shouldnt be a part of
8694522 strong protocols in how we implement care and treatment for those who are impacted by hiv aids
8694523 the aids epidemic isnt about some other time or some other people its about my brother and your sister
8694524 this is unconscionable and an affront to every american taxpayer who is footing the bill especially because we are not talking about millions of dollars
8694525 instead we are talking billions of dollars lost to fraud waste and or abuse in 2006
8694526 passes constitutional muster under the first amendment the equal protection clause and the due process clause
8694527 an unconstitutional regulation designed and intended to ban virtually all citizens from engaging in fundamental rights and liberties on significant portions of public sidewalks and streets
8694528 the cane toads cannot survive in much of southern australia because they would be too cold to move about and forage or spawn
8694529 we found that cane toads can barely hop once they get below about 15 degrees celsius
8694530 their range would also be constrained by the limited availability of water for their tadpoles in some parts of australia
8694531 these are perfect conditions for growing wine but you are unlikely to meet a toad at a winery
8694532 our study is particularly helpful in predicting where cane toads could live under climate change because we have identified a cause and effect way that climate limits the toads
8694533 in one way it is obvious why dry conditions are bad for frogs they lose too much water
8694534 but having wet skin also provides frogs with a thermal challenge because the evaporating water takes heat away from their bodies and often makes them colder than the air
8694535 is offering a high risk test that has not received adequate clinical validation and may harm the public health
8694536 this whole enterprise of looking for weekly cycles is rife with possibilities for misleading oneself
8694537 i doubt that there is a weekly influence of human activity on such a large weather system
8694538 weve got about 10 kids who play on friday night and the quality depth is as good as weve ever had
8694539 what we dont have is a 4 4 second 40 yard dash speed guy or a home run hitter but i will take a summers holmes or petrino those guys are very good high school football players
8694540 deans a match up problem for a lot of people
8694541 hes not going to beat people with his speed although hes definitely not slow hes just strong with great hands and does a great job of body positioning hes going to be a tough kid to single cover for any team josh hale is another big target with great hands against shiloh it was third and 12 and brandon allen steps up and hits josh on a dig route for about 16 yards the guy was all over josh and he made the catch
8694542 theyve done a pretty good job communicating on the field
8694543 we busted a few assignments in the scrimmage two coverages that were easy to see but free safety steven shelton and strong safety bobby petrino have done a real good job at this point communicating what coverage weve checked into and thats their job so far the linebackers have done a pretty good job of communicating between themselves and the defensive line are we great no are we getting better yes hopefully that improvement will continue we dont have a lot of vocal leaders that doesnt bother me as long as they play hard and its all business inside the white lines
8694544 if cody goes on another 15 play drive at tailback were going to need some fresh legs at linebacker but i saw some good things from the guys who didnt start in the scrimmage and were going to use a lot of them theyve all got to be ready to play
8694545 weve got to get more production from our mike linebacker
8694546 he was getting blocked a little bit in the scrimmage but that allowed cody hammer to make plays and he did
8694547 say it loud i am black and i am proud of my country
8694548 so long as there are veterans the benevolent and protective order of elks will never forget them
8694549 i feel comfortable and very satisfied with what ive designed
8694550 the trip was enlightening and depressing to see what people have done to each other
8694551 there were time when you would break down and ask how the hell did this happen and how can we prevent this in the future
8694552 so long as there are veterans the benevolent and protective order of elks will never forget them
8694553 decades ago we werent careful with coal mining as a result we are still paying huge sums to clean up acid mine drainage from that period and we will be for a long time
8694554 we need to be careful and vigilant or we could see lasting damage to our water resources from so many deep gas wells being drilled across pennsylvania
8694555 fracking as they call it can require several million gallons of water for each gas well and some wells may be fracked more than once during their active life which might span more than a decade
8694556 where that water comes from and what the drillers do with it when it is recovered is a big issue for our state the fracking water can have various chemical additives along with natural contaminants from deep underground when it comes back to the surface so it needs to be collected and treated or recycled properly
8694557 although highly diluted with water the proper treatment of all gas well waste fluids is a big issue that needs to be addressed
8694558 homeowners who have their own well or spring and are within 1 000 feet of a gas well site are very likely to be visited by water lab employees hired by the gas company
8694559 if homeowners decide to do their own water testing its important that they have an unbiased expert from a state certified lab collect the samples in case the sample results are needed for legal action
8694560 although we have occasionally seen effects on water supplies beyond 1 000 feet the regulation that is written into the gas and oil act states that any water supply within 1 000 feet of a gas well is the drillers responsibility for six months after drilling
8694561 if there is any complaint the driller is guilty until he is proven innocent outside the 1 000 feet distance and six month time frame the burden of proof shifts to the homeowner
8694562 our mountain streams many of which harbor wild trout are precious resources and we cannot allow them to be dewatered to dangerously low levels
8694563 two drilling operations in lycoming county recently were shut down by the state department of environmental protection because they were drawing huge volumes of water from small streams in violation of the clean streams law
8694564 so long as there are veterans the benevolent and protective order of elks will never forget them
8694565 renewing the middle class ending the war in iraq creating a universal health care system and boosting clean energy
8694566 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8694567 i cant wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american
8694568 knows both the opportunities and the pitfalls and you want that experience
8694569 daschle added that obama might have to disaggregate his comprehensive health care and energy proposals to pass them piece by piece
8694570 has drawn more attention in this presidential campaign than in recent elections
8694571 political reality is that health care reform is just one of many issues on voters minds and even then expanding coverage matters less than controlling the rise in health care costs
8694572 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8694573 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8694574 the network music player will be the cd player of the 21st century and squeezebox boom is the first player in its class to deliver high quality audio in a compact all in one design
8694575 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8694576 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
8694577 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8694578 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defence officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8694579 after the game was over i was disappointed in our offensive line because i thought we should have run the ball a lot better
8694580 after watching the film i need to apologize to those guys and offensive line coach mark white
8694581 i thought our offensive line played a lot better after taking a closer look
8694582 our running game struggled simply because we lost a numbers game
8694583 i thought we did a good job of pass blocking but quarterback brandon allen got happy feet a few times which comes from being a young guy and hell get over that
8694584 the pocket probably looked like it was collapsing a little when he could have just stepped up a little but overall i thought the offensive line did a much better job
8694585 defensively weve got to line up a little faster and recognize formations quicker and get our calls finished
8694586 we had a mix up in the secondary and weve got to get that corrected but i liked the fact that we swarmed to the football you have to like the fact that we created a lot of turnovers there were a lot more positives than negatives but weve got to get those mistakes corrected
8694587 i thought he took some major steps to let me know that he wanted to play on friday nights i like all of our starters and with coy holmes and kellen summers spot playing reid murray is another guy who can help there so i feel real good about our depth in the secondary its better than weve had
8694588 its a tough place to play if i make a mistake as a defensive tackle usually only the coach and myself will know if i make a mistake at corner everyone in the stadium knows theyve got have a short memory because its a tough place to play experience will help them
8694589 what happened against shiloh was that we got our guys blocked and they were slanting to a gaps and bringing a linebacker
8694590 we were running a lot of plays between the guard box and they put four guys there any type of off tackle play we could have really hurt them but we didnt want to do that yet thats something thats still in our bag of tricks
8694591 on the zone runs we were having some leakage some run throughs and thats something weve definitely got to clean up
8694592 overall i was pleased not ecstatic but pleased i think the defensive line we were up against was one of the better ones well see and i think that had something to do with it too
8694593 we had one fumble but looking at the film its hard to tell if he ever had the ball or if he was hit as he was getting it or what
8694594 weve just got to do a better job overall of protecting the football and giving our guys times to make the play
8694595 we dont have a guy whos going to be joe stud on everyones scouting report i want them to say all our guys up front are good and we cant leave any of them unblocked if they do their job and keep guys off our linebackers i feel like we can be really good
8694596 either the front guys have to pay exceptionally well or the linebackers have to be exceptional for us to be successful
8694597 if we want to be really good then obviously both have to happen if our front guys get pushed around the linebackers have to make big plays its easier for the linebackers to make plays if the line does their job

8694602 obama wants to leave iraq because hes a muslim loving freedom hating terrist
8694603 i actually think that fiscally the war is destructive and that the false premise on which the war was started does not justify our continued violence
8694604 i can only imagine what saddam hussein would be doing with the wealth he would acquire with oil at 110 and 120 a barrel
8694605 im very happy with the way our campaign has been conducted and i am very pleased and humbled to have the nomination of the republican party whiiiir click
8694606 i believe its clear that he had every intention to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction
8694607 i think there some kind of time delay with this interview its like being inside john mccains brain

8694617 we knew there was something we could make a game out of but we didnt just want to abandon what everyone had been playing around with
8694618 the great thing about line rider is its elegant simplicity
8694619 we knew there was so much we could do to it but we didnt want to ruin it by making it too complex
8694620 he came out for about a month and a half
8694621 we put him up across the street and have him come over every day he and our lead engineer here started playing around with the next update of the flash version
8694622 after they did that we sat down and bounced around ideas like game design stuff and what we wanted to feature in the new games
8694623 you just push a button and it spits out an avi
8694624 i started watching these videos come out on youtube and called up techdawg
8694625 we had him come here to help us with course design he amazingly has really good design sense he flew out for about three weeks and sat down and went over game design ideas and tried to figure out what we wanted out of story mode maps

8694628 we commend the u s department of justice criminal divisions computer crime and intellectual property section the u s attorneys offices for the western district of north carolina and the eastern district of virginia and the federal bureau of investigation for their work in bringing these criminals to justice
8694629 these decisions illustrate once again that game piracy will not be tolerated and the extent at which these criminals will be prosecuted the esa and its members will continue to support law enforcements efforts to protect the intellectual property of our industry

8694643 a troop increase is likely to inflame afghan nationalism because afghans are more anti foreign than we acknowledge and the support for our presence in the insurgency areas is declining the more responsibility we take in afghanistan the more we undermine the credibility and responsibility of the afghan government and encourage it to act irresponsibly
8694644 this lawsuit is a poorly disguised attempt to deflect attention away from the primary cause of the decline of the sacramento san joaquin delta estuary
8694645 the truth is that the massive increase in the diversion of water in recent years has accelerated the crash of the delta fisheries although many factors such as pollution urban development and invasive species affect the delta excessive water diversion is the leading cause of the decline in the fisheries
8694646 delta smelt salmon and striped bass have successfully co existed in this ecosystem for more than a century there is no evidence that recent population declines of either delta smelt or chinook salmon resulted from predation by striped bass whose numbers have also collapsed
8694647 in contrast there is strong scientific evidence that dams water diversions pollution and the collapse of the planktonic food web in the upper estuary are harming all the fishes that rely on the bay delta
8694648 delta smelt and chinook salmon have shown continuous long term declines since the 1960s and 1970s when the state and federal water projects began exporting water and striped bass have shown the same decline
8694649 there has been no evidence of a classic predator prey relationship no reputable scientist has pinned the crash of smelt and salmon on the striped bass
8694650 although they claim to care about the ecological health of the delta the so called coalition for a sustainable delta is most interested in maintaining their historic allotment of taxpayer subsidized water exports their efforts to blame striped bass are ridiculous and a desperate move
8694651 we hope they will focus their attention on the real issues affecting the health of the delta compared to the alleged striped bass predation issue there are hundreds of more important issues affecting salmon and smelt in this once great estuary
8694652 im certain the endangered species act was never designed to decimate an important recreational asset like the west coast striped bass fishery and remove its status as a sport fish
8694653 yet thats exactly what will happen if the irrigators prevail in this lawsuit
8694654 i hate to think of all the tackle shop owners marinas and fishing guides that will be unnecessarily harmed if the coalition for a sustainable delta wins this suit
8694655 blaming striped bass for the decline of endangered bay delta fisheries is yet another devious plot of the water grabbers who comprise the coalition for a sustainable delta it is obvious the coalition considers the striped bass to be a roadblock for claiming more northern water
8694656 they should put their efforts toward addressing the real problems that have adversely affected delta smelt and chinook salmon if the coalition is successful in their greedy attack it will signal the end of a great fishery for many individuals and families and for many young and old anglers who love the thrill of catching a striped bass
8694657 freedom of speech doesnt protect speech that you like freedom of speech protects speech that you hate
8694658 this is part of the fraud that is whats so disgusting about this place

8694660 this election were going to see matching or exceeding levels of support from jewish voters than weve seen for previous democratic tickets
8694661 the jewish community is going to be very solid behind obama
8694662 im absolutely convinced that by the end of the convention week we will see the support for obama rising
8694663 gaza barely made a blip on cnn fox or the sky news broadcasts
8694664 it didnt happen to me so why do i care
8694665 the young lady kept coming by and she kept telling me that this is going to be an easy deal and this is just a money transfer
8694666 its tragic that the police sent a lamb to slaughter
8694667 rachel liked to act like she was this and that but if the cops bought her act that she was mature enough to handle it theyre stupider than i thought
8694668 should we have trained her called it off notified people we were required to by law etc etc in hind sight yeah we should have but whatever thats what happened
8694669 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8694670 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8694671 whats more likely to kill the average american a swarm of killer bees dehydration or a drunk driver
8694672 im really good at making very plausible excuses of why im not yet keeping kosher my roommate would never respect a kosher kitchen i would never go to my parents house and tell them i was unable to eat off their dishes i have been trying to learn more about kashrut all of the intricacies i look for hechshers on items i buy and i generally try to stick to pure unprocessed foods that would be de facto kosher like most fresh fish and vegetables so im happy to cook kosher style even if my kitchen has at one time or another produced meals that would not receive rabbinical approval but to be perfectly honest i really like some treif foods a hard saucisson sec on a cheese plate or the fresh brininess of raw oysters these things really have no substitute so whats a girl to do i was raised eating ham and cheese sandwiches but now must i shun the lobster because i have chosen to convert to judaism and what do i tell my parents they might be ok with not cooking up bacon when i visit but i dont think i would ever feel comfortable trying to impose any other dining restrictions on them at the moment i have resigned myself to accepting my life as it is
8694673 you just never know until actors get together but when i saw adam and josh in the rehearsal room i practically went on my knees to give thanks
8694674 im pretty sure adam feels the same way were playing brothers so its important we have that
8694675 at least thats what i feel if adam doesnt feel it hes a great enough actor to fake it
8694676 i havent worked with josh before but fortunately we have discovered we work in the same way we discovered that very quickly
8694677 im not really here to sell myself i understand that people are often very interested about private lives but im not a star im not a celebrity and i just think im not that interesting
8694678 i grew up near watford a sort of suburban commuter belt land my family had lots of relatives in north london and golders green my parents now retired were heavily involved in charity and the jewish community
8694679 semi secular but lets just say that i had enough of a feeling of a typical north london jewish community where two thousand years was set to be able to draw on it
8694680 then i made the mistake of having lunch with howard davies
8694681 the first preview of paul stepping out on to that stage was the most fear i have experienced walking out under rehearsed and under prepared thats the clich d actors nightmare you dont know who youre playing there are thousands of people sitting waiting for you to do something and you havent a clue
8694682 i would think wow this time last night i was in that world and now tonight but of course they were curiously linked in a strange not so tenuous way they were both jewish
8694683 waves that batter you when youre in a storm in your life
8694684 ive certainly had those thats probably as far as i would go
8694685 i just try really hard to be led by really good work
8694686 give people the opportunity to learn and enjoy this rich sensual tradition that has the power to make hips shake and souls soar

8694691 on israel the obama biden ticket is as good as it gets
8694692 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community
8694693 joe biden has been to israel numerous times and has gotten to know many of israels most important leaders
8694694 both biden and obama may say all the right things about our ally israel
8694695 mccains fundamental attitude about israel is existential he sees any threat to their existence in the never again terms of the holocaust the democrats are all about pragmatic solutions this mostly means one sided concessions of the type that when attempted in the past have caused nothing but death destruction and misery to the jewish people but now that this guy biden has been chosen im beginning to believe that mccain actually has a chance
8694696 i do not think it would best serve integration to allow more faith schools they are not the answer and so i will be supporting this coalition
8694697 it seems to me that faith schools just cause people to live parallel lives and do not help integration
8694698 this is not about jewish schools but about faith schools in general including catholic muslim sikh and hindu ones i will be able to give much greater details after the launch on monday
8694699 it is absolutely disgraceful for someone to be a rabbi and yet fight our very own day schools and to have a hand in an agenda that can destroy all our schools and cause more assimilation
8694700 it is disgraceful to give them a platform as they do not speak for 99 per cent of the community
8694701 this is not about jewish schools not appointing non jewish teachers as all the schools have non jewish teachers so that has never been an issue
8694702 this is staggering faith schools are a gift and a partnership between a community and the government to try to undermine them makes no sense
8694703 the rabbis are entitled to do what they like but i would not support this and my preference is that they should not be doing this
8694704 the policy that has underpinned education in this country for the past 60 years has been one of choice
8694705 what we campaigned for is for parents to have a choice in how they educate their children we are confident we have the ear of government on this
8694706 i know that they are often setting a great example to our education system
8694707 its too expensive it takes too much time we cannot afford it
8694708 basically a secondary world fantasy with victorian era technology so rather than being a feudal world its an early industrial capitalist world of a fairly grubby police statey kind
8694709 ga jij s naar je kamer en bemoei je er niet mee
8694710 well we can use flash to draw svg on browsers that dont support it thus rendering flash obsolete once and for all
8694711 its nothing too serious if anything itll be a lyrical war which ill engage if he engages and if not then youll let it go away
8694712 it almost feels like a zombie at this point its the walking dead
8694713 its such an abrupt end to what was e3 which had been this huge escalating arms race
8694714 i understand why they really pulled the plug on the big e3 looking at the amount of money a company like ea would spend on it it was ridiculous amounts of money just to be present and competitive with everyone else so i think they were looking for a way to sign the arms treaty and de escalate the whole thing
8694715 right now were in this kind of dicey do we have an event what event is it which one do we go to
8694716 i think were in an uncomfortable transition zone when really the real e3 died a couple of years ago
8694717 not for as long as i live it will certainly take some time
8694718 perhaps we neglected to pursue that avenue playstation games are rather designed for those who play a lot although its a different strategy it pays off
8694719 id actually make the point that for us second hand sales is a very critical situation because people are selling multiple times intellectual property
8694720 what were trying to do is build business models that are more and more online supported with additional services and additional content that you get online so people will see the value in not just getting that physical disc to play at home alone but actually playing those games online and paying for them
8694721 in our understanding of the business model we are actually giving away the rights to play and if you just pass it on pass it on pass it on that is not comparable to second hand sales in the normal physical goods area where you have physical wear out second hand cars second hand clothes second hand books theyre all physically wearing out so you have an inferior quality product
8694722 but digital goods is not actually becoming inferior in quality so people passing that on is actually very challenging for us
8694723 its actually also a very interesting discussion to ask how much cannibalisation do you really have on second hand sales
8694724 thats such a complex subject were not going to be overly confrontational were going to solve it with better more interesting and online offering going forward and that should actually solve the whole current dilemma
8694725 but it was the doctors opinion that it wouldnt get any better
8694726 there wasnt any indication that there was a problem there
8694727 were in america but alaska hawaii seattle the commitments the same youve got to really plan to come here to get here its like ok stop everything set aside a day were going to maui same thing
8694728 the difference is that putins government presided over 2 5 3 times increase in living standards for the average russian
8694729 i think calling them morally equal is a bit simplistic

8694774 clearly the relationship between ayers and obama is much deeper and longer than obama admits they in fact were partners in various entities and regularly exchanged ideas including on how to turn chicago schools into re education camps to create a generation of social revolutionaries
8694775 be aware of the social and moral universe we inhabit and be a teacher capable of hope and struggle outrage and action teaching for social justice and liberation
8694776 explain that relationship for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
8694777 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense to me
8694778 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8694779 my feeling is that the recession started in the fourth quarter of 2007

8694782 cuando comienza la liga se hace con ilusi n creo que nos han venido bien los reveses de pretemporada para saber que en el primer partido de liga hay que cambiar la intensidad porque esto es otro juego
8694783 es normal que en el primer entrenamiento est un poco cortado pero con el paso del tiempo ir demostrando lo buen futbolista que es el a o pasado jugamos contra l en pretemporada ante el benfica y la verdad es que me dio muy buenas sensaciones

8694792 man thats like meeting a surgeon at a party and asking him to cut of a mole and then getting offended like hes talking down to you when he says hes not that type of doctor
8694793 i could say yes but knowing my schedule i probably would not be able to find the time to do it and then youd be mad at me for not following through on my promise im actually saving you a lot of headaches and your faith in me as a friend person by refusing to help now so you can find someone else to do the job for you
8694794 nah no idea what that is cant fix something like that over the phone maybe when ill check it out when come around sometime

8694823 but perhaps you may still be in the same humour of not believing me in earnest you may continue to tell me i affect to be paradoxical in commending a conversation as advantageous to reason which ended in such a total uncertainty of what reason had seemingly so well established
8694824 i have been considering my friend what your fancy was to express such a surprize as you did the other day when i happend to speak to you in commendation of raillery was it possible you shoud suppose me so grave a man as to dislike all conversation of 60 this kind or were you afraid i shoud not stand the trial if you put me to it by making the experiment in my own case i must confess you had reason enough for your caution if you coud imagine me at the bottom so true a zealot as not to bear the least raillery on my own opinions tis the case i know with many whatever they think grave or solemn they suppose must never be treated out of a grave and solemn way tho what another thinks so they can be contented to treat otherwise and are forward to try the edge of ridicule against any opinions besides their own the question is whether this be fair or no and whether it be not just and reasonable to make as free with our own opinions as with those of other people
8694825 if men are forbid to speak their minds seriously on certain subjects they will do it ironically if they are forbid to speak at all upon such subjects or if they find it really dangerous to do so they will then redouble their disguise involve themselves in mysteriousness and talk so as hardly to be understood or at least not plainly interpreted by those who are disposd to do em a mischief and thus raillery is brought more in fashion and runs into an extreme tis the persecuting spirit has raisd the bantering one and want of liberty may account for want of a true politeness and for the corruption or wrong use of pleasantry and humour
8694826 no matter where you live whether you experience the four seasons of the northeastern corridor or you live in permanently balmy los angeles there is a cold and flu season it starts about a month after school resumes in the fall and it lasts until spring break
8694827 there are many reasons why kids are regularly sick from october through march mostly it has to do with the fact that they are in school together for several hours every day not just sharing food and drinks but also coughing and sneezing on each other
8694828 most of the illnesses they pass around are viruses which are infections that will go away on their own after five to seven days
8694829 most parents send their kids to school before they realize they are sick that first day of a virus a child might complain but doesnt look ill
8694830 regardless of why a sick child goes to school their attendance means that more kids will get sick
8694831 the best way for anyone parent child or teacher to avoid catching an infection from someone else is good basic hand washing
8694832 toddlers tend to be sick the most often with a virus cough or runny nose or fever or fussiness every four to six weeks
8694833 you cant stop the world when someone in your house gets sick it is simply not possible and the way these things travel just as one person is on the mend the next is starting to come down with it there are times when it feels like there is no break from illness but in general if your child has a fever is coughing frequently feels exhausted or looks rundown it is best to take the day off from school

8694852 tele tubbie prompter cracks and name calling people here and 10 times worse on republitarian write stuff they would never never say to another persons face
8694853 i just cant believe that you and the other obama supporters that have posted before would be that hesitant to write views contrary to what others may think for fear of being attacked
8694854 rf ive never called anyone a name on any one of the local blogs and yet ive been called b amp h an idiot a moron and other colorful names why should anyone put themselves in a situation where they have to spend the energy even to ignore this kind of behavior behavior that wouldnt be tolerated in the home church workplace classroom or in public places
8694855 obama supporters who post on local blogs have the intellectual chops to have a conversation about their choices with anyone
8694856 whackette set the tone by letting the first post in that mocking obama stand unchecked and unchallenged if this is what you want have at it

8694896 i look at blu ray being the obvious short term differentiator but if everything goes to digital download and over time it will then the blu ray device no longer has the same competitive advantage or the benefit is not as strong as the feature is
8694897 perhaps maybe five years maybe seven years i think the challenge with digital distribution is more because of piped to the home bandwidth than the technology within the systems
8694898 digital copyright issues have been resolved largely the cable companies have certainly shown that you can digitally encrypt and prevent theft of intellectual property over broadband if they can do it certainly our industry can do it

8694900 is that enough to get you to buy one console versus the other as opposed to someone who is buying it for a game franchise
8694901 over time i think youve always seen software drive hardware selections if the game franchises are all available on everything its sort of hard to know
8694902 perhaps maybe five years maybe seven years uhh in 5 7 years when digital downloads take over we will be on ps4 and xbox 720 so blu ray will be a differentiator for the pretty much the entire ps3 lifespan this article doesnt directly concern the 360 moved to ps3 section as usual more spin w little to no substance taz427 game console 80gb ps3 im still dubious as to whether digital downloads will ever really replace physical media i know people think that digital downloads are the future but i really hope that is not the case he wants to tell me that in 5 7 years every house in the planet will have fast broadband to buy the games in digital form good luck with that there are 2 categories of n00bs what percentage of the worlds gamers dont have access to broadband internet 5 to 7 years is a pretty long time then again there are major things to consider bandwidth what you pay for that bandwidth drm with comcast already throttling users who use a lot of bandwidth i dont think digital downloads for hi def content will ever work its not due to technical limitations but just plain old greed the second thing is drm with a disk at least one has a physical asset with drmed downloads what happens if the company you bought it from goes down like yahoo took down their music servers this month what if you want to play your media on a competing os console device unless the content providers get their act together i dont think digital distribution of content is going anywhere thats not as much the issue as who has the bandwidth to download a 9 25gb game in a decent amount of time takes me about 30min to download 700mb thats only if i get a really good connection imagine trying to download mgs4 the game would release june 12th but you wouldnt get to play it until july 12th qft its one of the main reasons that i have no yet bought anything from the psn video store the hd movies are almost 9gb hell if i wanted to watch one of those movies id have to start downloading it a week before i wanted to watch it its so much faster and cheaper to just go rent a dvd or blu ray and i dont see this situation changing anytime soon maybe you could play some of it as you download it like a demo kind of demos are lets say a gig and are just a part of the game sometimes a single level and if you played it and while you were playing it you continued to download the next level and so on mgs4 had multiple installs im more worried about the cost of the data that the isp will end up charging you for anyway five to seven years and its already been out two ish errm ten year lifespan thats lets see ten minus seven minus two equals urm yeah winnah my game scores based on how much maybe the next consoles will come with a blu ray burner so you can back up your downloaded games my game scores based on how much so many good points posted in this thread showing clearly why digital distribution of games is longer than what this guy thinks the way i see him from the picture when digital downloads become hot he is gonna be so old he wont be able to see the buttons on the remote control to change the channel edison carter rulez there are 2 categories of n00bs digital download will never take off in full force bandwidth and storage will always be the issue hd graphics and images are growing faster then the rate of internet connections in most countries i mean i would love to download 25gig games on a 10mb connection but on a 1 5 connection it would take 10 hours and kill the rest of the connection and we havent even hit the issues of storage space 80gb 4 games 320gb 16games i am all for digital download it is a great idea but not pratical for consoles ps3 mgs4 gta4 assassins creed burnout paradise warhawk falklore enchanted arms psp ff7 cc 52

8695048 but were not sure how long it will take or if it will even work

8695076 thats not bad for a bishop who is not the biggest tlm enthusiast out there
8695077 he must hold firm to the sure word as taught so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it
8695078 for how can two walk together unless they be of one mind
8695079 i would like to argue that within angli canism diversity is here to stay in fact that diversity is our friend and also that permission to experiment needs author ity the absence of any or all of these leads to what i can only call an anarchy of tyranny i say this because enforced uniformity issues in exclusivity and the withholding of permission to experiment leads to the same end my understanding of the dynamic and organic understand ing of authority is that it requires diver sity if it is to take all three strands of the anglican theological method together and in creative and progressive tension scripture tradition and reason

8695084 but we would hope that perhaps on the 10th anniversary nine years from now to come back and do it again
8695085 thats not bad for a bishop who is not the biggest tlm enthusiast out there sure it could be better but then things could always be better in this life couldnt they

8695111 under the bush administration the number of people without health insurance has dropped
8695112 health officials said the turn is the result of a growth government sponsored health insurance programs and the decline in the use of private insurers rbc
8695113 private health insurance fell covering 67 5 percent of americans in 2007 down from 67 9 percent in 2006 employment based coverage also continued its long decline in 2007 dropping to 59 3 percent from 59 7 percent
8695114 we want a system of health care in which everyone can afford and acquire the treatment and preventative care they need
8695115 mccain this is nothing more than a re statement of the bush administrations
8695116 an important part of his plan is to use competition to improve the quality of health insurance with greater variety to match peoples needs lower prices and portability families should be able to purchase health insurance nationwide across state lines
8695117 while still having the option of employer based coverage every family will receive a direct refundable tax credit effectively cash of 2 500 for individuals and 5 000 for families to offset the cost of insurance
8695118 when families are informed about medical choices they are more capable of making their own decisions and often decide against unnecessary options
8695119 as president john mccain will work with governors to develop a best practice model that states can follow a guaranteed access plan or gap that would reflect the best experience of the states to ensure these patients have access to health coverage one approach would establish a nonprofit corporation that would contract with insurers to cover patients who have been denied insurance and could join with other state plans to enlarge pools and lower overhead costs there would be reasonable limits on premiums and assistance would be available for americans below a certain income level
8695120 states should have the flexibility to experiment with alternative forms of access coordinated payments per episode covered under medicaid use of private insurance in medicaid alternative insurance policies and different licensing schemes for providers
8695121 families place a high value on quickly getting simple care government should promote greater access through walk in clinics in retail outlets

8695127 good morning folks were on our way to san francisco we expect to arrive at 11 45 am we expect a smooth trip you can expect your luggage on carousel c
8695128 were very happy to be heeere when we spoke laaast you said that you were experiencing increasing overseas comptetitionnnnn and were confident that we can heeelp youuu and it will only cost one hundred thousand dollllars

8695131 as a result this will help you grow your sales
8695132 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
8695133 so if he obama were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states what im concerned about is can he bring me the electoral votes of the state of virginia
8695134 vendor b has just bid 50 000 for this project does anyone want to go lower aah yes vendor j is willing to cut its price down to 48 500 here we have it 48 500 going once going twice
8695135 vendor c is still in the game theyre offering 42 500 they must really want to get their foot in the door of our company because we know theres no profit in that ridiculously low amount

8695154 i am excited about evolving my on court apparel with nike to a polo and shorter length short for the u s open however we collectively decided i would continue wearing the apparel ive been competing in all year its a decision we made based on the limited time ive had to practice in the new apparel between the olympics and the u s open
8695155 my understanding is that they will use the engine the maya files where the characters come to life but theyll be creating animated i think its a 20 minute cartoon im personally quite intrigued to see how it comes out lego every time theyve had a new brand out theyve done some cgi stuff as well but i think this will be quite different
8695156 but i can say that theyve been working very hard since the release of shadow of the colossus soon youll see tokyos more focused on consumers so were still working on the intricacies
8695157 with a thriving gaming community already present and growing in canada we are proud to extend the opportunities and benefits that our u s eca members have been enjoying over the years
8695158 canada is an important area of growth for us and we are excited to welcome canadian gamers who are interested in community and any issues that affect gamers
8695159 i dont care how it happens i just want to see michelle get evicted first followed by ollie or jerry
8695160 who do you think america said would most likely blah blah and blah
8695161 this game would be perfect if i could just change this
8695162 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists
8695163 but we found a way to take a c f bond that you can do very little with and break it and convert it cleanly into something else at room temperature
8695164 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8695165 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
8695166 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
8695167 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
8695168 this is an exciting new method that will help us understand the timescales of fundamental volcanic processes driving eruptions
8695169 we have to take those things apply them and get better
8695170 its not just the surfers involved there are fishermen walkers cyclists photographers many people from the community will be affected
8695171 its the most accessible piece of foreshore in australia at the moment you can basically drive right up to it
8695172 what that means for the elderly fishermen is they dont have to walk a couple of kilometers to cast a line
8695173 i really do feel that the broader community will be missing out if access is cut
8695174 detectives are using that information to weed out the missing person calls coming in
8695175 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon
8695176 only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8695177 some of the practices that these folks hammered may provide alternative forms of understanding how to do low level sustainable development today
8695178 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8695179 if you find it in europe its a city if you find it somewhere else it has to be something else
8695180 they have quite remarkable planning and self organization more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8695181 this throws a wrench in all the models suggesting we are looking at primordial biodiversity
8695182 the intent is to find an operator first to get the building program right
8695183 pilots are doing a lot more talking air to air

8695186 the overcrowding relief bus is not going to be there every day
8695187 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
8695188 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
8695189 well would you like to come in for a hand treatment
8695190 its awesome if we need to get our message to stick with people why not do it naked
8695191 all the headlines speak of the historical nigh last night
8695192 if last night was historical tonight is going to be epic
8695193 nectar which was thought to be natures soft drink may not be so soft after all
8695194 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8695195 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8695196 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8695197 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8695198 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8695199 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8695200 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8695201 sofia mulanovich is one of my favorite surfers and to beat her at home in front of everyone is really special its something i will always remember
8695202 i have nothing to lose out here and im just happy to be in the competition surfing against the best surfers in the world i am just trying to have fun and do my best out there
8695203 i was able to nail a pretty solid turn at the start and the wave stood up for me long enough to cram another turn there on the end section
8695204 the conditions out there this afternoon are fast righthanders which really suit my surfing so thats good for me
8695205 i was out in the water when i watched lee ann curren take out sofia mulanovich and that fired me up a bit
8695206 its good as it allows me to gain a little ground in the ratings and hopefully i can keep going here in france
8695207 i was injured for the first event of the season but i think it was good in a way in that it made me sit back and really appreciate what i do and really want to compete again
8695208 i was able to get a fifth at bells and i think this season im just working on being more consistent in terms of my results
8695209 trestles is probably the closest thing i have to a home break on tour
8695210 it is the only mainland u s event and its been probably the most consistent event year to year for me ive loved trestles since i was very young
8695211 i know the numbers and possibilities roughly in my head
8695212 i would love to wrap this thing up at any point but yes trestles would have been really nice
8695213 a good result at trestles could really set my momentum back up a mess up could really rattle and shake things up for me i didnt think id be looking at this the way it is now though so its all fine from here on out
8695214 its been a while since i had my last tour win
8695215 there is no easy explanation but i do know that i am feeling fit i do have the right attitude and i am going to be ready to compete ive won the event before and know that i have to be 100 on my game if i want to repeat that
8695216 its a very different business the hard goods business compared to apparel the truth is that it was a bit of a stretch for quiksilver
8695217 were really pleased that the court agreed with our position it shows that the government has to be responsive to the public that they serve
8695218 its premature to say what our next steps might be
8695219 the swell that was forecast has changed overnight and we went on hold this morning because of some unfavorable wins
8695220 the winds have died down now and were seeing some good waves roll through the bank so we will be running as much as possible today
8695221 i do not exclude the missile defense shield sites in poland and the czech republic being chosen as targets for our intercontinental ballistic missiles
8695222 right now we are supporting the ps3 launch we are really excited to be bringing the bioshock experience to a whole new set of fans weve been concentrating on ways to make this game special the things that weve added theyre not changing the original experience that the 360 fans and the pc fans got but are things that compliment nicely that experience
8695223 the answer is no right now this is a ps3 exclusive
8695224 i think youll be happy i can tell you that much
8695225 graphical quality our goal was always to make sure everything looked just as good as on xbox 360 so there was never anybody who could say hey why didnt i get this on 360 originally because i dont feel like its up to the visual quality were just trying to make sure that everybody is happy
8695226 in terms of specific things it hasnt made much difference the original game fit on a 360 disk so it wasnt like we were in need of room weve tried to do what we can to make sure that the ps3 looks just as great as the 360 but in terms of necessarily utilising something specific about blu ray to my knowledge blu ray hasnt necessarily made a huge difference
8695227 the answer is no right now this is a ps3 exclusive
8695228 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8695229 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8695230 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8695231 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8695232 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8695233 improving crystal quality and purity leads to explosive materials that are safer less likely to react violently when subjected to mechanical impact or heat
8695234 the design of custom solvents through first principles modeling opens up new possibilities for the dissolution of materials that are hard to dissolve
8695235 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8695236 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8695237 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8695238 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8695239 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure
8695240 we were surprised to find that long in fly time before a fly takes off in response to a predator or swatter it plans the direction of the jump by making a rather complex series of postural movements
8695241 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8695242 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8695243 the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small changes in its posture to reach the correct pre flight stance
8695244 these instruments have done for the time domain what the electron microscope did for space
8695245 as these instruments become more common i think we will see that animals perform many behaviors on rapid time scales that simply evaded the detection of our sluggish eyes
8695246 had fallen below nyse minimum standards for average closing share price and average market capitalization

8695250 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a refinancing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8695251 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8695252 the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
8695253 this is the perfect storm with venezuela the unitedstates spain the high debt and the share price all happeningat once
8695254 if cemex didnt have such strong cash flow generation iwould be worried but my analysis shows that cemex has theorganizational capacity to survive this it is not as if we areseeing an exodus of top company staff

8695256 were going to allow senator mccain to make that announcement
8695257 he has also willing to take on orthodoxies and to be a maverick at times certainly not to be president bush on certain key issues and i think the american people respect that
8695258 they stole 6 332 from me and then they had the legal muscle to get away with it
8695259 we have to assume the water was used because it went through the meter and we have no evidence that it was defective
8695260 he thought i should be able to make the problem go away
8695261 if i had a leak in my house i would repair it instantaneously
8695262 i think its intentional the ordinance is written that way to avoid any potential for giving away public services
8695263 this has siphoned off a tremendous amount of my energy a fair amount of my money and it has been unpleasant
8695264 indeed there doesnt seem to be a ready explanation for where the water could have gone
8695265 i can come out here and do whatever i want to do if i was in the city i would probably be getting into trouble
8695266 it has been a very long process a very detailed process
8695267 wouldnt it be nice if there was one ribbon and every one was fought equally
8695268 it gives everyone the chance to be advocates and say heres what cancer is about

8695270 fight the good fight every moment every minute every day
8695271 theres been a tremendous amount of site work for the new fields
8695272 you can begin to see where the track and the fields are going to be
8695273 our student parking lot actually remains the same though the traffic pattern is different
8695274 thats a new rear exit that has been put in
8695275 our total classroom number will stay the same but science classrooms and the counseling center are being enlarged
8695276 the school will have a new auditorium and new music rooms three music rooms
8695277 the cars will be parked on the west side of the bus loop but the buses will be on the east side near the building
8695278 once buses are in the loop cars wont be allowed to move through the bus loop and will be directed to the south parking lot

8695280 we take rural development seriously and this is the reason we have joined with the community of sherwood content in this effort usain is an inspiration to all jamaicans young and old and we felt that his achievements should be celebrated and heralded as a standard that we must all seek to attain
8695281 we have a little girl who wants to play with our dogs constantly she crawls in their cage and rubs their belly we call our grandson crocodile guy because he likes to get them down and pry open their mouths the dogs are totally sweet
8695282 the dog gently nudges my hand licks my fingers and though we met only a couple of hours ago he obeys my every command all the while his vibrant eyes beam up at me dancing with loyalty and love an absolute angel and then bless his heart when i point to that young woman across the room he rushes toward her and tries to rip her arm from its socket with a ferocity forged in the fires of hell the angel is a devil dog too

8695311 its not often that you will hear a goat bleating for no apparent reason and if you do it most often signals that something is wrong act immediately
8695312 provided the essential intellectual drive that led us to the moon
8695313 the only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible
8695314 im sure we would not have had men on the moon if it had not been for wells and verne and the people who write about this and made people think about it im rather proud of the fact that i know several astronauts who became astronauts through reading my books
8695315 a hundred years ago the electric telegraph made possible indeed inevitable the united states of america the communications satellite will make equally inevitable a united nations of earth let us hope that the transition period will not be equally bloody
8695316 the inspirational value of the space program is probably of far greater importance to education than any input of dollars a whole generation is growing up which has been attracted to the hard disciplines of science and engineering by the romance of space
8695317 it may be that the old astrologers had the truth exactly reversed when they believed that the stars controlled the destinies of men the time may come when men control the destinies of stars
8695318 as our own species is in the process of proving one cannot have superior science and inferior morals the combination is unstable and self destroying
8695319 information is not knowledge knowledge is not wisdom and wisdom is not foresight each grows out of the other and we need them all
8695320 i dont pretend we have all the answers but the questions are certainly worth thinking about
8695321 it is not easy to see how the more extreme forms of nationalism can long survive when men have seen the earth in its true perspective as a single small globe against the stars
8695322 perhaps as some wit remarked the best proof that there is intelligent life in outer space is the fact it hasnt come here well it cant hide forever one day we will overhear it
8695323 sometimes i think were alone in the universe and sometimes i think were not in either case the idea is quite staggering
8695324 green mountain delivered on its commitment to cooperate with the commission just as we delivered on our contract with fpl to support its sunshine energy program over the last five years
8695325 this report is something they gave us in our ongoing audit our audit is expected to be complete in a couple of weeks and that will include our findings
8695326 i dont know that this specific program will be reinstated well have to wait and see what the audit says
8695327 was part of a bizarre double life his son had been leading
8695328 for harmon the visual density of the abstract imagery used will enable the viewer to enter an almost hypnagogic liminal state and become perceptually distant from the sense of the real once the enveloping visual content has become the landscape of the mind to the viewer the subliminal content will have access to the subconscious mind
8695329 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8695330 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8695331 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8695332 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8695333 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8695334 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive

8695371 i think bill clintons speech he really defined the choice and the selection
8695372 what got me last night was joe biden my wife and i were crying on the phone last night

8695415 i can assure you that if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade

8695433 is about the only thing rugby league does better than us
8695434 it could be one of the few occasions where bookies hold more on the nrl than on the afl
8695435 there are a few afl games which dont matter including hawthorn second versus carlton 11th with hawthorn playing the bulldogs third the following weekend in the semis
8695436 hawthorn may rest players meaning there could be more interest in two full forwards going for the ton than the game itself
8695437 punters wont back the swans until they see who plays
8695438 but the match is a fizzer for brisbane punters anyway with suggestions jonathan brown wont play and the reported turmoil between the players and the coach
8695439 there are different levels of betting activity in the nrl where the minor premiership is big
8695440 the cowboys are two points in arrears but they have the bigger points differential on the bulldogs 170 to 317
8695441 if the cowboys get a win in the last two weeks versus raiders at home and sharks away the bulldogs get the wooden spoon
8695442 our goal was to move into the last two games with a performance that was improving moving into a bigger and more important part of the season
8695443 were not going backwards with our preparation now were going into a schedule next week with a footy team thats on the improve
8695444 i think we needed last week more than the roosters and we played like it
8695445 we havent been playing the full 80 minutes and last week i think we finally played for the full 80
8695446 we havent beaten the tigers since about 2003 so theres no way well be underestimating them
8695447 tigers coach tim sheens is a smart man and whoever he ends up putting in there will do a job
8695448 we treat him as one of the most dangerous players in their team hes certainly going to be one to look out for
8695449 hes going to want to play his best game of the year against us and were prepared for that
8695450 hes a bloke who just hates to let anyone down and he gets very dirty if he does
8695451 whats refreshing about nick is there was no fanfare about money just a genuine desire to be at the club
8695452 one thing about nick is he has a wonderful work ethic and attitude hes really professional with his preparation
8695453 i really wanted to stay here and ideally id like to finish my career here
8695454 i never wanted to go to another club this is my sixth year and its only the last two years i have been playing regular first grade and ive really loved being a part of the team
8695455 there are some guys leaving next year and i would like to push for a run on spot thats what my personal goal is and what im hoping to achieve next year
8695456 i think nick has a lot of good leadership qualities which is something we definitely need in our forward pack
8695457 we had the opportunity to let him go he was off contract but we wanted him to stay
8695458 some guys who get it easy sometimes switch on and off but nick doesnt do that because hes had to fight for everything hes got which i admire him for

8695463 idc research is finding that the use of server virtualization is moving past the early adopter stage and is quickly becoming a mainstream solution
8695464 as it professionals update their standard server images for new installations they are increasingly integrating virtualization to simplify deployments to increase the system flexibility boost usage rates and increase portability of the applications
8695465 microsoft is basically bringing itself in line with other virtualized licensing practices in the industry
8695466 it makes more sense to enable customers to manage licenses more productively and easily anything that makes implementing virtualized systems easier is a good thing
8695467 it is unfortunate that such an issue is decided by a small group of technicians this decision is not purely technical it has extremely serious and extensive socio cultural impact society should be heard this is a topic of digital citizenship the right of fair use and to save images the way people want
8695468 the election air time on tv is a balm to comfort those citizens who imagined that their past elected governments had not done any work for the past 4 years in a few minutes the mistake is clarified and with surprise we find out that we had misunderstood and things are happening at a hallucinating pace with a little help from computer graphics its possible to create a parallel administration

8695480 over 50 years ago the cervical smear test was introduced which should be applauded for the immensely positive impact it had and will continue to have on womens health in new zealand
8695481 what was great about it was that i took it while i was working it wasnt a set up and it used natural light it didnt need to have a lot of artwork done to it and its good to see a pure and simple image be so successful at the awards
8695482 because the awards are judged by photographers there is often fierce debate between them about the qualities of each image its a valuable experience for photographers to go to these awards and see so many amazing images being judged
8695483 it doesnt take away from capturing the image and in many ways it makes it look better than the real thing
8695484 i mean its historic 40 years after the jfk i have a dream speech

8695490 it is not always the parents fault the laws are not in the 21st century they are still lost in the dark ages
8695491 new zealand law needs to look at that we need to look at making young people some who are near to voting age accountable for their crimes
8695492 they shouldnt dump the responsibility on parents they are disempowering parents thats whats happening if a child refuses to go to school it is the child who is breaking the law
8695493 what they do now affects them for their future they have all the power in the world now they cant arrive in the future and blame anyone but themselves
8695494 young people get in to drugs girls have babies they think the easy way out is going on to the dpb

8695497 under the circumstances russia had no other moral choice but to support appeals of south ossetian and abkhazian peoples on the recognition of their right for self determination in line with fundamental international documents
8695498 i do not mean to say that this was enough but it is a positive tendency positive dynamics
8695499 this inability of course harmed our relations first of all intergovernmental
8695500 we expected the u s to intervene in the conflict and stop the aggressive actions of the georgian leadership
8695501 the u s administration not only failed to restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal action but the american side in fact trained and equipped the georgian army
8695502 we the foreign ministers of canada france germany italy japan the united states and the united kingdom condemn the action of our fellow g8 member
8695503 i have no sentimental attachment to my forebears instead i feel im chasing much bigger game here stalking the madness that stalks my family in a direct line down to but not including me
8695504 how was i to know that she was the wife of big jack white she certainly looked fine in her expensive clothes how was i to know that she was some schizo
8695505 the united states is not russias main trading partner their mutual turnover accounts for less than 4 of russias foreign trade therefore cuts in u s demand for russian exports will not have a serious effect even in the middle term
8695506 gazproms advance into the european markets has been blocked by the european unions new directive on security of natural gas supply
8695507 these contracts will suit azerbaijan only until the nabucco pipeline is commissioned after which it will not need the route across russia
8695508 but russian companies willing to buy assets in the u s will find that it has become much more difficult to do
8695509 tensions with the united states will not be fatal for the russian economy
8695510 russia will remain a key energy supplier for europe and is also becoming a crucial market for european and american goods and services
8695511 the market has slumped dramatically which made the price we offered include a 100 premium of the stocks current value we did not want to sign the deal under these conditions one doesnt do this during the first three days of a slump
8695512 we have maintained good relations with the company and we like it on the whole
8695513 the canadians specifically need a russian strategic partner capable of providing financial and administrative support
8695514 the dollars appreciation and growing political tensions have cooled down investors interest to gold mining assets

8695517 somebody in his administration leaked the name of that person valerie plame
8695518 the possibility of penetrating these groups the possibility of knowing that theyre going to carry 10 pound bags of explosive in the subway stations will go right down the drain
8695519 every foreign intelligence service would run plames name through its databases within hours of its publication to determine if she had visited their country and to reconstruct her activities
8695520 i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states

8695551 adult education has always played an important role in our city and i am delighted they are celebrating such a momentous anniversary
8695552 many of todays courses like it and instrument making are very different to those on offer in 1908
8695553 your men and women have gained the respect and admiration of our people
8695554 they are neutral friendly and always willing to lend a hand in our communities
8695555 on behalf of my people and my government prime minister we thank you very very much because we know you are a friend and new zealanders are also very good friends of timor leste
8695556 while we are taking care of our two fragile institutions we are still in need
8695557 by next year we hope we can say it is already time to say thanks once again to the australian and new zealand troops
8695558 it is certainly our desire not to be there for the long term but to provide the support and the mentoring and the community policing models
8695559 even though it may be difficult not to react to the market remember that saving for retirement is a marathon not a dash
8695560 history shows that the pain of a down market doesnt last forever losses from market declines are merely paper losses until the asset is actually sold
8695561 whether the current bear market has reached a bottom or not is unclear but one thing we know from this study is that market gains have more than made up for losses for those investors who stayed invested over the long term
8695562 the market has always recovered but by trying to predict the best time to buy and sell investors may miss the markets biggest gains
8695563 the shakedown went good and at the moment the car is very good and i am happy the shakedown track is not really like the rally roads so ill have to see but they are drying out and theres a lot of gravel so going first is not very good
8695564 were really happy with the last three days and the next three days are supposed to be the same
8695565 the roads are drying out and its looking good for a really great event
8695566 i am leading the championship so i am happy to start first
8695567 were going to have to push it to get a result here because jari matti latvala and dani sordo are fast here
8695568 i also want to fight with the other guys as well the biggest problem is the shakedown area is not representative of the roads themselves you only need a couple of kilometres of road to set the car up which weve got but you really need the stages to get it right
8695569 by the time the world rally cars had cut it all up shakedown stage it was pretty rough
8695570 it was good to blow the rust out and get myself back in the groove i would like to be in the top five of the p wrc at the end of today and my priority is to make my mark in the p wrc rather than concentrate on the new zealand championship because thats where i see my future
8695571 its quite important to us because the championship is not looking good and we love getting the woolf whittaker memorial trophy for first new zealander
8695572 its something that means a lot to the team and our sponsors the whole of new zealand gets behind you we definitely want that trophy back
8695573 the last two years weve had issues but weve managed to place well
8695574 wed like a clean run and it would be interesting to see where we would actually finish if we did
8695575 i think if you take too many risks early on youre risking a lot because its a whole three days that you have to get through
8695576 its going to be a matter of treading reasonably lightly over the first day stepping it up a bit on the second and then if everything feels good going for it on the third its all about balancing risk and result
8695577 some of the wrc drivers have run on the tyre before whereas the locals havent
8695578 im so delighted to see the back of patsy and kevins appointment is a bit left field but it is interesting so we look forward to discussion with the board about the rationale for this
8695579 we need every police officer to have access to tasers as quickly as possible
8695580 now that the go ahead has been given each district is eager to have them and i am confident that it will happen it has to happen
8695581 but it all comes back to funding because it will cost a lot of money to train every officer but we have to find a way to do it
8695582 ive got no worries about that i rang wayne smith and asked him for his thoughts about it and he said it will help develop my skills a little bit more
8695583 obviously i will be getting some time at nine later in the game hopefully i can use that time wisely
8695584 being out at 10 you have a bit more vision to see where people are and who is coming out of the line so i guess that in a way helps my development and vision at nine
8695585 i definitely do enjoy first five too its good to be out at 10 because you can sort of have the opportunity to run at the line and test the line
8695586 but its the main thing to consider that selection for the black jersey its getting back into ordering the troops around and making sure im doing my best to check the defence line and put boys into holes
8695587 hes the all black no 9 or one of them but its just that we have so many injuries we need that experience in that area
8695588 we focused our work around three themes everyday browsing the things that real people do all the time safety the term most people use for what weve called trustworthy in previous posts and the platform the focus of beta 1 how developers around the world will build the next billion web pages and the next waves of great services
8695589 for those times when youre shopping for your wifes birthday present but dont want her to know
8695590 there are sites that youve visited that you didnt know had a line of sight on you
8695591 this is the only way to make sure sites dont get information about you
8695592 we took our time with this one because it was the first one but it went very well
8695593 were one of two new zealand sites participating in an international registry with this kind of valve
8695594 our goal really with that appointment was to make this happen within 12 months im delighted to say that weve managed to do it
8695595 i have written to the council and asked them to re analyse the emission stack carbon filters they have archived
8695596 we want them to hold on to them for the department of labour and ministry of health investigations
8695597 ridiculous in the extreme to fight to clear his name without the foreign affairs role he would be free to fight for the tauranga seat and free for one last herculean effort to hoist his party over the five percent threshold needed to get mps into parliament
8695598 reaching substantive conclusion on the fta is a significant achievement and one that represents a huge milestone in new zealands engagement with the worlds most economically dynamic region
8695599 the asean economies represent a market of more than 575 million people and are an increasingly important destination for new zealand goods service suppliers and outward investment
8695600 this means we protect new zealand businesses access to asean as well as securing a competitive advantage against other countries that are also active in the region
8695601 the importance of concluding this fta goes beyond simply trade benefits the agreement is also critical to new zealands longer term strategic engagement and interactions with the asia pacific region
8695602 i felt so much for kerry and how wonderful a person she was

8695605 georgian parliament is instructing the government to sever diplomatic relations with the russian federation
8695606 parliament declares the territories of south ossetia and abkhazia occupied by russia
8695607 ethnic cleansing by russia on the occupied territory of georgia
8695608 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us deliberately created this conflict in order to worsen the situation and create an advantage for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8695609 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate it sounds not rational
8695610 we expected the u s to intervene in the conflict and stop the aggressive actions of the georgian leadership
8695611 intelligence reports said authorities and a number of well known public organizations in ukraine plan actions against the black sea fleets navigation and hydrographic support facilities
8695612 the purpose of this sub commission is to discuss any problems that might occur in a civilized manner decisions by local ukrainian judicial institutions have no legal power in relation to russian black sea fleet facilities and attempts by public movements and organizations to obstruct the operation of these facilities would cause extra tension in the region where the black sea fleet is located

8695617 while the law has to be twisted for them to get on the ballot in texas rules are rules except when they inconvenience those who make them
8695618 third parties are never given second chances when it comes to getting on the ballot
8695619 and third parties are often thrown off the ballot for the most minor infractions of ballot access laws in texas we have a clear deadline that was not met by the republicans and democrats but it is all but certain that some way some how the establishment candidates will find a way on the ballot some people are just above the law

8695637 weve had a real focus on trying to drive our subscriber acquisition cost numbers down
8695638 a lot of that is being able to develop better opportunities for third parties to market us

8695648 the new policies have led to rapid economic development chinas real per capita income has grown an average of 8 4 a year since 1995 climbing to 4 766 indias 5 average annual growth has raised per capita income to 2 534
8695649 about 45 of chinas workforce remains in the countryside 30 is in services and 25 in industry seventy percent of indias workers are still on the farm leaving services at 20 of the labor force and industry at 10
8695650 labor migrating from rural areas can usually go to work doing the rote tasks of factories so industry often takes the lead in economic development this may provide a growth spurt but research shows industry eventually bumps up against a ceiling at about 30 of the labor force and a per capita income of 20 000 beyond these levels further expansion of goods production doesnt raise income and economic progress comes from increasing services share of the economy

8695679 we now know that the higgs boson does not have a mass of 170gev c2 if it did have this mass then we should have seen evidence for it at the tevatron by now ruling out possible masses of the higgs is a very important part of the hunt for this elusive particle
8695680 the observation of the very rare zz process is a real stepping stone to the higgs following this with the first direct higgs mass exclusion since 2000 is tremendously exciting
8695681 it shows that the tevatron experiments are very much in the race for finding the higgs

8695689 the demographics of elizabeth since the reagan democratic vote in the 1980s have changed somewhat with a large influx of hispanic immigrants they i believe are going to vote democrat because the issues affect them just the same such as lower wages home foreclosures jobs that have left the area for blue collar workers

8695692 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8695693 we wont stand for threats of this kind in colorado
8695694 a death threat is not a legitimate form of political expression
8695695 looking back historically conventions have tended to be hotbeds of controversy and this year simply wont compare
8695696 no offense to your profession but there will be 15 000 journalists in denver seeking to make any minor differences seem like a major controversy
8695697 theyll be reading between every line to detect notes of disunity
8695698 nice thing about the appearance of controversy is that it attracts attention and pulls in viewers who wouldve otherwise not watched the convention

8695801 i no longer trust this station in the event of a serious breaking news event in my community
8695802 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8695803 the current teaching of the catholic church on human life and abortion is the same teaching as it was 2 000 years ago from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the moment of conception to natural death
8695804 that debate over abortion in our church has not morphed but changed over a thousand years it always is viewed by the church as something that is wrong but theres been gradations of whether it was wrong you know from venial or mortal sin as we catholics say and versions of it
8695805 i presume that bidens integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8695806 a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them

8695815 inflation of 4 percent is too high it needs to come downand we are doing everything we can to reduce it
8695816 naturally we have a very limited instrument which isinterest rates
8695817 if they did we would be very happy to have lower rates but it doesnt seem to me that interest rates of 4 and a halfor 4 25 percent are particularly restrictive

8695830 there are rocks glass and pieces of rusty metal we pulled out of the ground
8695831 you can slide on a rock anywhere but most fields arent gong to have three bars sticking out of it and these are hard fences you can really get hurt
8695832 we need to improve the fields we used them gezer and sportek but they are not really at a professional level
8695833 gezer is a particular problem we probably should have anticipated more safety requirements at gezer
8695834 secondly the players themselves have been too lax all season not wearing batting helmets and not paying attention on the field during practice so the horse escapes the barn door gets closed we did institute some better safety procedures at gezer
8695835 there have been a couple of problems with the umpires here
8695836 they dont know some of the rules they dont know correct umpire positioning they have inconsistent strike zones at times they have a bad habit of ejecting players for no specific reason and most importantly some of them have trouble taking control of the game
8695837 we are meeting with investors every day and we have a meeting with major league baseball affiliates this week the buzz is fantastic
8695838 it was funny because the ibl was close to striking it was surreal
8695839 some of the players took video of the makeshift meeting because we all thought it was so funny
8695840 i said ill talk to you all day and well fix the problem but im not going to be here with you saying if youre not happy youre going out on strike
8695841 the problem at the beginning of the season was that they didnt understand that we overpaid them the first time and therefore we adjusted it the second and our communications broke down in other words after two weeks there were supposed to get a weeks pay and then have that week delay as in most businesses after two weeks we paid them for two weeks so after the second two weeks we paid them for one week and we were gong to start the delay and they said hey wait a minute we worked two weeks and threatened a strike it was explained to them and they understood it
8695842 i believe that they knew seven or 10 days ahead of time that it was going to be late
8695843 dont just have us show up keep telling us youre going to pay us and then when we get there when you knew 90 percent chance that it wasnt going to come through tell us hey were really trying to get you paid it could be up to a week late were gonna push it back were gonna try and give you 100 200 shekels to try to get you by just work with us im more than willing to work with anybody 100 percent i understand financial backing new league things are going to happen im ok with that but be up front with me be honest with me dont bs me around
8695844 i know how hard it is to say no and i am very aware of how persistent and sometimes over zealous our fans can be
8695845 but we cannot throw balls into the stands anymore i just brought over 3500 more baseballs this is it for the rest of the season if we run out we stop playing
8695846 do you have any idea how hard it is to say no to a seven year old boy asking for a ball
8695847 what should i tell him no son the league has threatened to fine me if i give you one right
8695848 if you look at the last two summers we had gush katif two summers ago we had the lebanon war last summer this summer was just really relaxed i was able to come with each of my kids to the game we met a few of the players and we really got to know them it was like coming to watch a bunch of friends play
8695849 we did i think a superlative job for a new league marketing among americans in america and among anglos in israel
8695850 and we did nothing with israelis part of it had to do with organization we talked about it a lot and then we didnt hire anybody to do it for a long time and then there was a budget issue we spent a lot of money on the television contract this was our management fashla
8695851 theyre called the raanana express but they dont play here there is no publicity about them in town and you cant buy tickets locally
8695852 there ought to be a concerted attempt to reach out to raanana a city of 75 000 one third of whom are english speaking immigrants there has to be a stronger connection to the city in order to build team spirit and team support can you just name a team after a city without actually involving the city or its inhabitants
8695853 its a shame this is what they are doing to us after we put our heart and soul in it
8695854 we did not expect this kind of management from a league whose commissioner was the former u s ambassador to israel
8695855 yes we do owe them money but im confident that they are gong to get paid its a haval that we didnt have the cash flow to pay them its haval that they didnt want to do it on faith that they are going to get paid so haval everyones going to get paid
8695856 it will be different in the sense that you will have other complaints the food is always going to be a complaint but id say that 75 percent of the legitimate stuff that these guys complained about this year legitimate being because it was true well fix it
8695857 we need more personnel league personnel just to handle issues very often players didnt know to whom to turn so you just need enough people someone who is responsible for x and responsible for y and you know where to go so those are the things well work on
8695858 my personal experience has just been wonderful in every aspect of it
8695859 to be able to play and compete having my wife and children here for three weeks and having them involved in one of the most exciting things of my life has just been phenomenal and being a jew you cant come here and not feel some sense of spirituality and im not a religious jew

8695861 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
8695862 that speech was amazing but its not going to change my mind
8695863 i talk to plenty of people like me who just wont accept an unqualified president
8695864 obama has said a lot of stuff but nothing with a concrete vision
8695865 i have heard at least some sensible things from senator mccain hes a comeback kind of guy and ive heard from many other people who are clearly leaning in his direction
8695866 had it been a different republican democrats would not have been able to consider defecting so easily
8695867 but given the perception that mccain is a moderate there is a good chance that some clinton supporters will defect to him
8695868 just the other night hillary clinton made a strong heartfelt case to her supporters and all americans for why they should join her in supporting barack obama for president americans across the country understand how urgently we need change not four more years of failed bush policies and weve been very pleased that so many who supported senator clinton in the primary have taken active roles in the obama campaign organizing raising money and most importantly talking to their friends and neighbors about the clear choice in this election

8695885 whod of though she would actually have listened to what the pope said
8695886 y our knowledgeable claim about the history of the churchs position on abortion shows you actually know church doctrine which interferes with our ability to call ourselves catholic without having the slightest idea what that means by the way who let you into our church anyway
8695887 the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation

8695909 your indication that youre willing to put a person who has a clear unequivocal pro abortion record within a heartbeat of the presidency is alarming
8695910 sen mccain you are exceedingly proud of being a political maverick you wear it as a badge of honor well poke the base of the republican party the conservatives in the eye one more time by choosing a pro abortion vice presidential candidate and conservatives will show you that two can play the maverick game

8695915 the u k did not experience as big a refinancing boom as america did but in almost every other metric the boom was the same we had a classic overbuild of homes a belief that double digit price gains could not end and of course reckless lending

8695943 has to reassure those people they will be included and that theres room for them under the democratic tent make them feel at home
8695944 is not alone in convincing naysayers inside or outside of his party that he should be president

8695946 the economy and the war in iraq people want out of this war as soon as possible and they want a new direction for the economy
8695947 that should bring swing voters his direction at least in my state of north carolina

8695972 as an american my heart is full now when i consider how far our country has come in nominating an african american to lead a major party that said it is important not to merely get swept away in the moment but also to consider sen obamas record
8695973 at a time when we have the largest black middle class in american history sen obama wants to raise taxes on anyone who makes more than 32 000 per year and at a time when nearly seven in ten black children that are conceived are aborted sen obama supported legislation that would deny medical care to protect babies who survived abortions

8695980 washington post ombudsperson deborah howell wrote a column in her own newspaper comparing the papers front page coverage of democratic nominee barack obama with that of republican nominee john mccain her findings examining stories from june 4 when obama became the presumptive nominee until aug 15 the post ran 142 political stories about obama compared with 96 about mccain as to front page stories obama was 35 to mccains 13 what about photographs the post ran during this time 143 pics of obama versus 100 of mccain the papers assistant managing editor for politics explained the discrepancy this way we make our own decisions about what we consider newsworthy we are not garment workers measuring our product every day to fulfill somebodys quota in other words obama makes good copy and this is after all a business fair enough but whats he got against garment workers but why then when the posts howell pointed out the discrepancy in photographs did the disparity disappear over the next two weeks howell writes that since she first pointed out the lopsided nature of the photo coverage editors have run almost the same number of photos 21 of obama and 22 of mccain since they realized the disparity mccain is almost even with obama in page 1 photos 10 to 9 wait a sec if the post assumed that photographs of obama drive sales then what happened the likely explanation is that the post considers itself a news organization and was embarrassed when one of its own columnists revealed its blatant partisanship
8695981 as for obamas popularity the basis for printing more stories about obama take a look at the recent polls a reuters zogby poll for example gives mccain a 5 point lead among likely voters with most of the major pollsters considering the race a dead heat does this not make mccain and obama at least equally good copy but many of these same people who defend the posts right to make a profit also demand the reimposition of the so called fairness doctrine to force radio station programmers to balance popular conservative hosts with liberal ones but fairness proponents show no concern when avowed bush haters such as nbc msnbcs chris matthews and keith olbermann put on their journalist hats and cover primaries debates and political conventions how bad is it take the recent studies by the pew research centers project for excellence in journalism a nonpartisan non ideological and nonpolitical research organization pej finds that from june 9 through aug 17 obama received significantly more coverage than mccain even during obamas hawaii vacation during the not particularly memorable week of june 23 to june 29 obama received more than twice the coverage of mccain 82 percent to 40 percent
8695982 the assumption seems to be that the only reason anyone could deny mr obama their vote is bigotry against black people but folks as admirable as the man is he is not perfect as he is the first one to admit as such when people polled say that race is a factor in their voting choice the pollster question that most arouses journalists on this issue it can mean that they are opposed to black people but it can also mean much else if a white person is put off by the anti white theatrics of the reverend jeremiah wright and found mr obamas dissociation from him a tad studied this does not make her a bigot if a white person has decided that michelle obama seems angry and that her speech at the convention was a pose i would disagree but it does not mean he does not like black people he may well have been put off by a white candidates wife who seemed angry if a white person never quite got past the bitter comment and has yet to hear a compelling message from mr obama on what change we can believe in is she is responding to serious problems with the obama campaign at present which even i a supporter am worried about but she is not a racist all of that is really pretty obvious and the tripwire readiness to instead look to bigotry first as the reason a fencesitter would decide to choose john mccain is based on a witch hunting mentality such people see all of these racists as lacking empathy i e for the history of blacks in america but dont they lack empathy for the way innocent people unconvinced by barack obama as a candidate may be thinking

8696073 the point is not whether kids are playing with learning or what medium they are playing in a ball field or a wii setup or a physics lab or art studio but rather why they are doing it just because it is electronic does not make it any better and it may turn out not to be as valuable

8696081 three years ago today this country watched as hurricane katrina devastated cities towns and communities up and down the gulf coast
8696082 yet in the storms immediate aftermath despite the magnitude of the devastation facing millions of americans the bush administration completely failed to provide any of the leadership needed to help communities recover even trying to slash wages for gulf coast workers helping to rebuild the region
8696083 the democratic congress has a very different view we believe that rebuilding the gulf coast especially the schools and colleges that have long been the cultural and economic engines of these communities should be a top national priority over the past two years we have taken steps towards this goal by providing much needed funding to help recruit teachers and rebuild and restart the schools and colleges in the region but we also know that there is much more to do in order to fully help students teachers and the broader education community get back on track ultimately we need a new administration that understands that long term investments are needed to help the entire gulf coast region recover and thrive on this third anniversary of katrina its time for a renewed commitment to helping gulf coast schools and communities come back stronger than ever and a new president who will join congress the philanthropic community and education entrepreneurs in this effort

8696087 there is no better time than the present for our presidential candidates to outline their plans for reducing the number of needy i strongly call upon each candidate to address this issue at their respective conventions in denver and st paul
8696088 some might try to spin this years report as an improvement however we must place these numbers in context in 2007 a year of economic expansion poverty rates were higher than in 2001 a recession year this trend is without precedent and is further evidence that we cannot interpret todays numbers to mean that poverty is improving or no longer an issue of concern in our country and across the world

8696119 a lot of people can still be saved we need doctors
8696120 everyone here is waiting for doctors to come and examine people but they arent coming and we are counting our dead
8696121 with 36 million tailgaters in the u s the kick off to football season is now one of our favorite all american pastimes
8696122 but we know our job on the team is to make sure tailgaters dont spend a dime more than they need to thats why weve put together some winning prices all in one place in the store

8696127 this year we have made a number of difficult but prudent business decisions in order to improve the health of starbucks and transform the company for the future
8696128 youre asking an awful lot of high school guidance counselors because the parents arent there to help students
8696129 when language is a factor it becomes extra challenging to meet the high standards
8696130 we really want to be culturally responsive in our teaching
8696131 is going to have to learn the lesson from pockets of success in california new mexico and texas
8696132 the complainant requests that the itc issue an exclusion order and a cease and desist order
8696133 the impact is so far reaching we thought we had a quiet community
8696134 now its not unusual to drive through this community and see a kill duncan bumper sticker on a nice car i can never even guess the reach of the effect on this community by this killer
8696135 our children are our most precious gift on this planet
8696136 to have that innocence ripped away from a child is unacceptable every child should be allowed to be a child
8696137 is a little bit of relief shasta will have some closure and justice will be done for her family when he receives the death penalty
8696138 ms martinez deserves that closure just as much as any other mother until there is closure for those families for me its not over yet
8696139 we know he was stalking this family he was hanging out at playgrounds
8696140 all you can do is take that information and protect your children and the children of neighbors
8696141 i havent been this jacked up in a long time
8696142 its like ive been locked up in a prison and my heart and mind have been locked up when this verdict was released it flowed out of me tears flowed of me
8696143 they were going to get married in a few months
8696144 the healing will never come for me or the rest of the mckenzie family
8696145 this trial has been awful rough on all of us
8696146 now weve just got to get on with our lives
8696147 tragedy is not really an adequate word to describe this
8696148 im scared for her to go to public school im scared for her to say hi to people in the supermarket
8696149 you are not going to take our children and kill our families we will hunt you down and find you
8696150 the whole family and especially steve has appreciated the prayers and wishes of the public
8696151 i expected this whole thing to be settled some time in 2006
8696152 i think this is a good first step hopefully he will never return
8696153 by his just laying down one wonders if this was the result duncan wanted
8696154 the speller is looked at sometimes as an arbiter of language
8696155 once a word is in the microsoft spell checker theres a notion out there that that word is now official and the word is now important we dont take that stance internally but that attitude exists in the world and we have to take it into account
8696156 theres no amount of logic that we would ever build into the speller that would suggest that we wouldnt do that
8696157 most of the time the cupertino effect happens because of proper names which are really difficult for a dictionary to handle
8696158 microsoft could have made the decision early on that were just not going to include any proper names and that might have spared them a lot of grief
8696159 to press as cloth rubber or paper between rollers or plates in order to smooth and glaze or to thin into sheets
8696160 more often masks the really common spelling error that people make for calendar
8696161 we basically ask that question across dozens of languages on a massive scale
8696162 there are thousands and thousands of words that arent yet in our speller which are infrequently used
8696163 electronic writing has a tendency to value speed over accuracy consistency and clarity
8696164 we just have to be vigilant and continue to cast the human eye over it and make sure were not being too trusting of spell checkers
8696165 respeitamos a autoridade da anac e apoiamos toda e qualquer medida que vise a seguran a do aeroporto de ilh us e de qualquer outro aeroporto brasileiro mas n o vemos qualquer sentido em restri es que em ltima an lise inviabilizem os v os operados pelas principais companhias a reas

8696173 he was captured at the airport he had just returned from
8696174 we strongly condemn this operation against one of the highest officials of the committee who had done good work
8696175 coalition forces captured a man suspected of working within the highest echelons of the special groups criminals
8696176 intelligence sources have implicated the captured man with multiple criminal acts including bombings and attacks against iraqi targets specifically the june 24 bombing at the sadr city district advisory council
8696177 its a lesson to prosecutors all through this country that they have to be fair before they become ferocious
8696178 unjustifiably interfered with defendants relationship with counsel and their ability to mount a defense
8696179 we are reviewing the courts opinion and considering our options
8696180 no corporation is obligated to cooperate or to seek cooperation credit by disclosing information to the government
8696181 refusal by a corporation to cooperate just like refusal by an individual to cooperate is not evidence of guilt
8696182 preliminary epidemiologic and microbiologic results to date support the conclusion that jalapeno peppers were a major vehicle by which the pathogen was transmitted and serrano peppers also were a vehicle tomatoes possibly were a vehicle particularly early in the outbreak
8696183 first neither raw jalapeno nor raw serrano peppers had previously been identified as a vehicle for a salmonella outbreak in the united states
8696184 largest food borne disease outbreak identified in the united states in the past decade based on the number of culture confirmed cases
8696185 we need congress to give the fda authority for mandatory controls for fresh foods
8696186 we need to develop technologies which will enable us to detect pathogens in fresh produce more quickly
8696187 the point is that not all industry is doing it and there need to be standards
8696188 this should be seen as part of a solution it isnt a silver bullet

8696210 i have been known to play a good game and not back it up so i have had a bit of that inconsistency
8696211 it has been something i have been trying to work towards its so important to be consistent and to perform every week not just every couple of weeks
8696212 it has been really good to play a few good games in a row and good to be able to play in a few really important wins in a row
8696213 after a good game mick malthouse says great you played well but its another big game next week so try to back it up
8696214 a few weeks ago we were touch and go for the finals but to have three wins in a row and having played some good team footy personally i cant wait for the end of the season and finals to come
8696215 the last three weeks he has been in the best form of anyone at the club since ive been at the club
8696216 he has kicked important goals when weve needed him to and done the hard things at the same time our results are because of his form
8696217 i didnt realise how much of a freak he was at training and on game day hes just fantastic
8696218 when i broke my ankle in 2006 i did a lot of rehab after that and i stepped it up from then on i got pushed a fair bit and my work ethic went up i realised i could push myself a bit more than i thought i could
8696219 it was probably part of my game i didnt think too much about in my first few years but when you look at the likes of aaron davey and alwyn davey and those types you think what can do for the team when i havent got the ball
8696220 in my early days it was all about getting a kick and trying to get the ball but its been a focus of mine now to chase and tackle and pressure
8696221 it was a great experience for me all star coach mark williams was great
8696222 he was very supportive that gave me a bit of confidence in the week leading up to it he just said to have fun and take them on and it panned out like that
8696223 it was a game i got a bit of confidence from in myself so that was great
8696224 i am happy at the pies they are a great club and they have looked after me since i came over i am really happy here
8696225 at the end of the year i am keen to get home and relax go out to the bush where i love being i might go out with my old man and do the stuff i did when i grew up
8696226 chris judd is unhappy at carlton and wanted to move rumour
8696227 sorry unsupported config not much i can do for you
8696228 this will keep the pressure on the afl to give tasmania a fair shake
8696229 its about revealing to the public the whole rationale for the afls decisions and exposing the strength of tasmanias case and the best way possible in an environment where people can say what they want to say under parliamentary privilege
8696230 the afl has decided the 17th and 18th teams will be from western sydney and the gold coast
8696231 beyond that weve not made any decision on the creation of any new teams in any particular areas
8696232 if the afl stood for the ordinary punter why wouldnt they support a team from tasmania
8696233 at the end of the day this is a publicity stunt by the labor party
8696234 for all of the time and money wasted on a senate inquiry it will still be up to the afl to decide whether or not tasmania gets a team
8696235 whether the afl commissioners obligations to current supporters of the game override their desire to promote larger television audiences for it

8696253 a resumption of the war in mindanao and sulu as radical elements in the moro islamic liberation front and the abu sayyaf raise the ante by making demands on the manila government that they know the manila government cannot accede to
8696254 president arroyo would respond positively to a call for martial law whether the causes are real or manufactured
8696255 but there would also be the possibility of a military takeover on or before 2010 precisely to prevent president arroyo from staying in power beyond 2010
8696256 in both scenarios martial law by president arroyo or military takeover on or before 2010 congress would be abolished civil and political rights would be suspended and there would be no presidential elections in 2010
8696257 but president arroyo would continue her maneuvers to remain in power beyond 2010 either as prime minister if we switch to the parliamentary system or as president without term limits if we retain the presidential system
8696258 so even under my best case scenario i do not think there will be presidential elections in 2010
8696259 conflict affected areas outside the bje which shall be the subject of special socio economic and cultural affirmative action implemented by the central government read manila pending the conduct of a plebiscite not earlier than 25 years from the signing
8696260 a resumption of the war in mindanao and sulu as radical elements in the moro islamic liberation front and the abu sayyaf raise the ante by making demands on the manila government that they know the manila government cannot accede to
8696261 president arroyo would respond positively to a call for martial law whether the causes are real or manufactured
8696262 but there would also be the possibility of a military takeover on or before 2010 precisely to prevent president arroyo from staying in power beyond 2010
8696263 in both scenarios martial law by president arroyo or military takeover on or before 2010 congress would be abolished civil and political rights would be suspended and there would be no presidential elections in 2010
8696264 but president arroyo would continue her maneuvers to remain in power beyond 2010 either as prime minister if we switch to the parliamentary system or as president without term limits if we retain the presidential system
8696265 so even under my best case scenario i do not think there will be presidential elections in 2010
8696266 conflict affected areas outside the bje which shall be the subject of special socio economic and cultural affirmative action implemented by the central government read manila pending the conduct of a plebiscite not earlier than 25 years from the signing
8696267 how the image would be perceived by a motorist passing it in transit
8696268 the reason we have advised you that we cannot post these as billboards is that out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8696269 my son and his friends would have been of draft age had there been a draft though none of them volunteered for military service since the war began i wondered about the young men and women who opted to serve and put their lives on the line i wondered about what they would experience at war and how they would manage their transition to civilian life in making these portraits i wanted to look into the face of a young person who had seen something unforgettable and i wanted to make that a serious and intimate view the way i would look at my own son
8696270 viewing these portraits of soldiers causes one to pause and think of the many sacrifices and efforts these men and women have experienced to protect us and defend this great country the portraits are a stark reminder of the reality of it all
8696271 for me looking at their faces serves also as a reminder to remember our service men and women and to thank them for all they do and have done i am disappointed that the billboards have been canceled and strongly hope the company will reconsider
8696272 we have every intention of moving forward with our plans
8696273 barring these images from billboards in the twin cities or any city for that matter not only deprives the public of seeing these beautiful portraits but it is an insult to the young soldiers who posed for these pictures
8696274 as a result senegals marine ecosystem has started to go the same way as ours between 1994 and 2005 the weight of fish taken from the countrys waters fell from 95 000 tonnes to 45 000 tonnes muscled out by european trawlers the indigenous fishery is crumbling
8696275 george monbiot is right i have campaigned hard in an attempt to discourage the eus
8696276 the government of senegal refused to renew its fishing agreement with the eu but european fishermen mostly from spain and france have found ways round the ban they have been registering their boats as senegalese buying up quotas from local fishermen and transferring catches at sea from local boats these practices mean that they can continue to take the countrys fish and have no obligation to land them in senegal
8696277 is it any wonder the world is facing a food crisis
8696278 the fisheries partnership agreements that have been concluded with third countries are totally unfair extremely damaging for the local population and have environmentally disastrous consequences like wwf oxfam and some others i strongly believe that they do not constitute sustainable development
8696279 will the commission maintain the same position will the commission stop these appalling fisheries deals
8696280 contribute to achieving the overall objectives of sustainable fishing through the establishment of partnerships with third countries which are based on the principles of conservation and sustainable management of fishery resources
8696281 e voc ainda me pergunta aonde que eu quero chegar se h tantos caminhos na vida e pouqu ssima esperan a no ar e at a gaivota que voa j tem seu caminho no ar
8696282 plaintiffs alleged injuries being induced to retire or resign were solely individual in nature
8696283 it would appear the damage was caused by an object fired from a catapult or similar device
8696284 firing objects at anything to cause damage causes expense for the owner and endangers lives
8696285 the man was riding a bicycle on one occasion but on each of the other occasions he was on foot
8696286 i need to identify this man and it may be that a friend or acquaintance of the man responsible is aware of his actions
8696287 it was a great event the last time we played
8696288 both clubs have passionate fans and were looking forward to it
8696289 were just proud to be scotlands representative in there and to be playing the european champions
8696290 its not easy but the three teams are fairly close by and theres no challenging trips there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8696291 im sorry for what happened and if she ever wants to return to our museum she will be more than welcome
8696292 the room guard was over zealous he should not have done it she already passed security and his only duty was to guarantee the safety of the artwork in his room
8696293 for doing his duty and making sure the law was respected
8696294 in the interests of the safety of all students as well as in recognition of the schools physical environment
8696295 the school will work with its parents and citizens committee and the school community to ensure an appropriate balance between student safety and their right to engage in gymnastic activities
8696296 we always love to draw the champion of europe as we did last year with fc barcelona
8696297 all of those things add up to good things and get us to the next round again theyre going to be fantastic games
8696298 with fernando and the other spanish players there will be huge huge interest in that one
8696299 its great thats what makes the champions league so exciting its fantastic
8696300 a partir de ah el resto de rivales nos van a pelear por entrar como segundos

8696308 para nosotros estar en el sorteo ya era una ilusi n muy grande tenemos que disfrutar de esta competici n y estamos contentos aunque el manchester united va a ser un rival dur simo
8696309 es igual de peligroso relajarse que pensar que no puedes ganar al manchester
8696310 adem s el madrigal ser un campo peligroso tanto para el manchester como para celtic o aalborg los otros dos rivales del grupo
8696311 los grandes equipos todo el mundo sabe quienes son y como juegan pero que hay otros que la gente los conoce menos
8696312 tomarse estos partidos seriamente para poder estar lo m s arriba posible y si es posible llegar como m nimo a octavos o cuartos
8696313 el placer de disfrutar cada d a de la adrenalina que supone correr en moto

8696315 si no fuese por los problemas con las gomas quiz tendr a el cuarto puesto un poco m s asegurado pero tambi n hubo ca das y malos resultados as que pensar en la tercera plaza tambi n se antoja complicado
8696316 una pista menos cr tica que laguna seca y brno as que en principio deber amos estar m s cerca de los bridgestone
8696317 las pruebas en brno fueron bien para m y para mi pilotaje y para michelin porque probamos nuevas gomas que mejoraron el rendimiento si esos neum ticos nuevos van a funcionar aqu eso ya es otra historia
8696318 es un grupo dificil simo porque est el mejor equipo del mundo
8696319 kun me habl muy bien del club y vengo a darlo todo por l
8696320 lo conozco muy bien y es un gran jugador no pudo estar muy bien en el valencia y ojal que ac est muy bien nosotros lo vamos a ayudar con los argentinos que le conocemos para que l pueda triunfar aqu en el atl tico
8696321 el partido de la previa de la liga de campeones era muy importante hay buenos futbolistas y este a o se podr conseguir algo con los jugadores que hay hay que confiar en nosotros que somos un gran equipo y seguro que se va a conseguir algo algo es un t tulo cualquiera me gustar a
8696322 la afici n del atl tico y nosotros mismos necesitamos tener algo y vamos a hacer todo por conseguirlo ojal que podamos llegar lo m s lejos posible en la champions y en la copa y si se puede ganar mejor todav a
8696323 para m fueron dos finales en los juegos ol mpicos y sta estaba muy contento con la medalla y sab a que en tres d as ten a un partido muy jodido y que si no gan bamos la medalla no la iba a recordar e iba a estar pensando que lamentablemente nos hab amos quedado fuera y gan las dos finales
8696324 se jug bien pero no yo sino todos corrimos todos salimos muy bien y se gan as que estamos todos muy contentos y hay que seguir para adelante anduvimos muy bien y supimos manejar a un equipo muy fuerte como el schalke que ya ten a experiencia de liga de campeones

8696329 this mammoth does not have any defects except for the fact that its tail was bitten off in terms of the state of preservation it is the most valuable discovery of this kind in the world

8696410 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8696411 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8696412 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off

8696501 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8696502 i am scheduled to be in minnesota tomorrow to be at the state fair
8696503 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years

8696563 although the story has been well known for years there are no documented sources and no published mentions of it
8696564 im not afraid if i knew it was going to happen i would go ahead and be president and do the best i could for the last day i could
8696565 wed follow you to hell sir but you damned sure didnt go that direction

8696568 the important thing for the team at the moment is that weve identified where improvements can be made with the fw30 and are making the necessary adjustments to take us into the final few races
8696569 the work everyone at the factory is putting in should help us out in spa
8696570 were not going to make a huge jump but well definitely be heading in the right direction
8696571 im really looking forward to the belgian grand prix because spa is an amazing race track
8696572 i finished sixth which was one of my best results of the season
8696573 t will be difficult to score points there this year but you can never predict what will happen somewhere like spa so well have to wait and see
8696574 its going to be the first time ive driven a formula 1 car around spa so my first priority will be to learn the circuit and to find out how the car behaves on this track
8696575 i have of course driven spa while racing in gp2 so know what a great racing track it is
8696576 in fact its probably one of the greatest tracks on the calendar so im really looking forward to taking my fw30 out and doing that first lap
8696577 we spoke about it at the beginning of the year
8696578 i consider it to have been a continual evolution since the malaysian grand prix
8696579 massa is going strongly he is determined he wants to learn and he pays attention to detail
8696580 he will become even quicker because he has gained what he used to lack continuity and a race rhythm
8696581 he is mature enough to cope with the pressure and we will help him
8696582 hell react hell soon come back strong he knows how to brush off criticism and polemics
8696583 he isnt happy with the way the car turns into corners
8696584 he would like a more aggressive front end and this affects him its up to us to carry on giving him a hand
8696585 it has been decided to strengthen controls over the whole component production of the cars
8696586 we have 40 people between the quality control and metallurgy departments
8696587 we are putting a lot of effort into finding the right settings on the car for this track
8696588 on top of that we are obviously paying careful attention to reliability and the way the car behaves over the monza kerbs an aspect of the package that saw us in difficulty last year
8696589 i think we are working well even if we will only have the first real confirmation of this after qualifying for the italian grand prix
8696590 it was a busy day as we tried lots of different settings on the car to try and improve the overall balance
8696591 once we were happy with the basic set up we did some work on the brakes as this circuit is very demanding in that area
8696592 we found out some interesting things and learnt quite a lot about how the car behaves with low downforce

8696606 i get that everybody doesnt love college football believe me i know
8696607 because to be clear college football is the greatest sport in america i say that as someone who has experienced everything from english premier league soccer to nascar a tennis major to the masters there is absolutely nothing in sporting life that compares to being on campus for a big time college football game nothing
8696608 i always find it so lame when people whove never experienced a college football game trot out excuses for why college football is overrated
8696609 theres nothing else to do in insert college football town here thats why people go
8696610 id put the average fan going to college football games in an intelligence test against the average fan going to any other american team sporting event and id feel pretty comfortable that college football fans would win
8696611 the nfl game is a pale shadow of college footballs fun but you dont have to take my word for it if youre a sports fan and you havent traveled to the sec the acc the big ten or the big 12 for a game then youre wasting your sporting life seriously you are
8696612 here are things that are guaranteed to happen to you this fall youre getting one year closer to being the old guy who hits on fat college chicks at your tailgate remember when you were in college and it always astounded you how the old guys would without fail hit on the most mediocre chicks when they walked past last year your buddy pointed out a fat chick and you guys all ogled her dont bother denying it
8696613 youll refresh your debate about which college quarterback had the most sex with the largest collection of attractive women
8696614 someone is going to suggest going by his old frat house you really cant do this fight hard especially if youre 30 or more and your own son isnt a member there but you know what youre going to end up there

8696627 my standard for doing another year is really high i need to make sure if i do another season its something that a i am proud of and b i am unbelievably happy with and c i can do something artistically different
8696628 when i look back i want to say i did everything i want it to be fun and i want to be able to do something new and different
8696629 fortified with nutrients to help keep dogs of all ages healthy and active and flavored for tastes that dogs love
8696630 dogs love hero water because its tasty and dog owners will love what it does to keep their dogs healthy and active
8696631 independently conducted taste tests at kennels showed not only that dogs are attracted by the scent of the water but they also loved drinking it
8696632 both took a couple sips then started to wander off i dumped the hero water and offered them a dish of fresh tap water and both dogs returned and took big long drinks from it so my guess is that after exercise on a warm morning theyd rather have tap water than hero water
8696633 the best man the best team isnt automatically entitled to win the winds of fate can turn you around run you aground sink you and sometimes you cant do a thing about it
8696634 you learn incredibly powerful habits from your parents everything from using food as a reward or to calm nerves and emotional upheavals
8696635 a family who decides to shift habits together will be able to create a less tempting and more inviting environment
8696636 moms and dads have to be the models and captains of the team so to speak theres nothing more hypocritical than parents doing something different than what theyre saying
8696637 i see the impact of the economy on the media
8696638 in boston there were rows and rows and rows of radio stations and it seems like there were a lot more reporters there i think the economy has impacted the media because i dont see as much of it as i did four years ago
8696639 i dont think since brown v board of education in 1954 will there be one singular moment that will make a bigger difference in race relations in this country than when on november the 4th we elect barack obama
8696640 one thing i have learned in this game is that its nice to have people talking about you but ive been the attorney general now for 8 months and im loving the job
8696641 i ran for attorney general to make a difference as attorney general weve got a lot of good stuff we are working on
8696642 its really a long winded way of saying i just turned 39 years old and who knows what the future holds for me but i know that i will never get re elected attorney general or to any other job by failing to do good work right here right now as attorney general
8696643 what our preliminary investigation has shown is that we have what appears to be a monopoly in the louisville market at the wholesale level
8696644 when ashland and marathon oil companies merged in the late 90s the effect over the ensuing ten years is the creation of what appears to be the market dominance of marathon we think thats the reason why louisville gas prices are so much higher than chicago or even the surrounding counties in kentucky
8696645 i dont think since brown v board of education in 1954 will there be one singular moment that will make a bigger difference in race relations in this country than when on november the 4th we elect barack obama
8696646 there is an energy here that was missing at some previous conventions

8696653 we have spent a lot of time studying the emotional curve of the game and worked to ensure that the challenge of each enemy wave creates an enjoyable pace and progression throughout the campaign
8696654 we added a number of game mechanics in each level to create a large dynamic range of emotion and strategy so that we can engage both the hardcore gamer and the novice through one shared emotional experience
8696655 the arm twisting to get that vote a lot of people are hurt there are a lot of hurt feelings
8696656 the people that were trying to get everyone to change from clinton to obama i think had good intentions i dont think those people who were trying to get those vote switched between breakfast and lunchtime realized how deep emotionally the clinton people are about hillary clinton
8696657 i was elected by the people of the 4th district to represent hillary clinton and thats what i did
8696658 last night i had a chance to spend time with my good friend joe biden
8696659 he has pledged to come to kentucky to work and i have pledged to give barack obama and sen biden all the time and backing that i can give
8696660 i dont think since brown v board of education in 1954 will there be one singular moment that will make a bigger difference in race relations in this country than when on november the 4th we elect barack obama

8696667 congress shows that lessons in eco driving techniques can bring down fleet fuel economy by as much as 26 percent
8696668 among the eco driving practices that drivers can begin practicing on their own are driving 55 mph instead of 65 mph keeping tires properly inflated at the recommended pressure and eliminating prolonged idling

8696682 none of us can provide a cast iron guarantee that salmonella saintpaul will not re emerge
8696683 is an important indication that this particular outbreak is over
8696684 one of the most important reasons is that russia must protect abkhazia and south ossetia against genocide by the war criminal georgian president mikheil saakashvili
8696685 saakashvili is totally militarized and brought in outside support washington gave them all of the weapons and it has started to give weapons to the war criminal again
8696686 russia waited for 20 years to accept south ossetia and abkhazia south ossetia and abkhazia never lived together with independent georgia never the question is how many years should we wait russia now has to make a new course a new policy
8696687 if the u s and britain think they are first level countries and russia a second level country we dont agree
8696688 we are the first sort if you recognize that kosovo is an independent country fine we will do the same with other countries
8696689 this is a strong message to everybody those who think that aggression against russia is okay should know that there will be a strong response
8696690 the west is very much afraid of the militarization of russia they are afraid russia will solve its problems the way it did in south ossetia through military strength
8696691 we know there is a huge difference between the e u and the u s
8696692 we know that the bush administration is working for the election of john mccain
8696693 russias interests coincide closely with the e u the e u is not interested in civil war in ukraine russia will be very careful and not touch the pipelines because they influence many countries russia will be quite moderate on this issue the most important issue is protecting human life not pipelines pipeline politics is the tactic of the neocons
8696694 we are forming a committee to look into maybe working out some kind of compromise and work with them because we want them to be happy and we want them to stay here

8696707 the golf cart reminds me of the peaceful summers i used to spend golfing in the hamptons with my friends june and virginia
8696708 but then tishman speyer claimed it was my full time residence so now i am stuck spending my summers here in brown town with inebriated college kids vomiting in my mailbox such a shame
8696709 we dont think reports about dirt fluid or miniature golf are funny entertaining or helpful for our residents
8696710 the main purpose of making this film was to create something original truthful and from the heart usually with films of today we see filmmakers trying to copy their heros with this film i tried to reflect off the possibility and aftermath of a nuclear terrorist attack and the horrors that go along with war

8696712 shocked at what this specific death signifies in the scope of the terminator
8696713 in the first season my intention was to almost frustrate people by not giving them the savior or hero of the world that they were looking for i wanted him to be weak and young and slightly immature and impulsive
8696714 but this year the hero that will eventually save the world will emerge and it doesnt happen just by accident
8696715 i wanted so badly to play the anger and the strength and the power and fight of my character and finally thats all ive been doing this year
8696716 everything has become much heavier for john ive gotten to do a lot of action and fighting but more importantly ive gotten to do some strong scenes with the other actors
8696717 i think we feel a little bit more confident this year because weve established ourselves as our own entity
8696718 before we were so concerned about staying true to the film which we still are but i think we feel that we can be more experimental now and more confident in taking risks

8696730 its because of all of you that michelle and i have this great honor of helping to lead the party and win back this white house
8696731 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8696732 matt and i are big entourage fans and we were introducing daniel to it
8696733 i told matt to improvise a few lines from the show i edited it and it ended up coming out really cool so i thought we should make some more
8696734 we posted it on here so people could see it in the absolute best quality
8696735 we were hoping to show our friends and family just personal enjoyment more than anything
8696736 i received a message through my video account on vimeo
8696737 this is probably the best exposure we could ask for
8696738 thousands of people will see this and thats a lot of industry people if they like what we did theres a possibility they could contact us and maybe some sort of job offer or internship could come of this
8696739 were hoping we can get some more things started here on campus and keep making bigger and better things
8696740 each year about 40 percent of sbir phase i awards go to firms with no prior sbir experience so there are plenty of opportunities to win funding
8696741 i have a different political standpoint i think obamas proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer
8696742 i wouldnt vote for john mccain if he was a democrat
8696743 i would not vote at all before id vote for him
8696744 i question whether cindy is someone id want to see in the white house
8696745 the fact is my mother and cindy had lots of contact
8696746 cindy continues to make the point that shes an only child and my mother has to relive it
8696747 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally

8696754 what are the things that evolution has at its disposal to define a creature to mix and match the parts and eventually come up with a unique organism thats going to live its life and try to reproduce
8696755 its kind of a biologists dream to be able to design your own animal to pick and choose the traits of animal groups that you most enjoy oh my gosh i love this
8696756 we get a lot of questions like why is that one on top of the other one
8696757 we do talk a lot about the birds and the bees
8696758 it would be like the brakes on a subway except with more rapidly fluctuating amplitude

8696762 to take advantage of ajax functionality the control inherits from iscriptcontrol
8696763 its a really hard time for new bands its not that theres a lack of good music its just that labels are struggling financially
8696764 some people say that record labels are bad but people forget they are the ones who break the bands and get them on their way
8696765 in the eighties no one was really going to see live music now its big business
8696766 she sunbathed in the nude did the laundry in the nude and washed the dishes in the nude and i was impinging on that
8696767 everyone else in the san diego music scene just waits for something to happen to them ray is the standard of what everyone used to do but now no one does he goes the extra mile
8696768 he has a great ear he woodsheds he learns songs and hes dedicated to learning music i dont see that anymore in san diego bands theyre just trying to get their cool factor up so high that enough people will think theyre cool and someone else a friend or manager can take it from there rays not waiting around
8696769 my introduction to national touring was opening for a band the killers that i had no idea was as big as they are
8696770 they had full on catering at every show which we mooched off it was a very different lifestyle than id known
8696771 dave asked if i wanted him to submit my name if ted sablay the killers touring keyboardistguitarist ever left
8696772 of course i said yes but i wondered why would ted ever leave my mom had always wanted me to get an advanced degree in medicine and funnily enough dave left the killers to go back to med school
8696773 they asked me you play violin too right and i tried to be nonchalant about it
8696774 but i saw the wheels turning not just in their heads but with their managers that a violin could add a new element to the band on stage
8696775 the killers members appear very cognizant that they are at a very high level and they seem very competitive with other bands
8696776 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try help people who are hurt through this
8696777 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind

8696891 a safe natural high potency sweetener would be a welcome addition to the food supply
8696892 but the fda needs to be as sure as possible that rebiana is safe before allowing it into foods that would be consumed by tens of millions of people it would be tragic if the sweetener turned out to cause cancer or other problems
8696893 i am not saying that rebiana is harmful but it should not be marketed until new studies establish that it is safe
8696894 the whole issue of what gets gras status needs to be reviewed by congress

8696904 the mahdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
8696905 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to support the iraqi people
8696906 the proof is always in the actions and not just in words
8696907 we have set a cultural programme for the mahdi army and we have named it al mumahidun supporters of the mahdi and everybody should abide by it and whoever does not agree with it will be expelled from the army
8696908 we want to transform as large a number as we can of mahdi army fighters into a social organisation
8696909 the resistance is for the professional fighters only that will be selected according to sadrs rules
8696910 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8696911 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8696912 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8696913 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8696914 we were on an operation in beit awwa to arrest some wanted men and had reached a darkened basement when we found two naked human beings
8696915 the place stunk like a stable and the ground was covered with hay
8696916 they shouted saying that if we go near the place their son bassam would cut us to pieces we later learned that he is mentally disabled
8696917 they are mentally disabled but we are taking very good care of them the police are lying
8696918 my husband was married to his maternal cousin and they had seven children five of them were born with various types of handicaps and have all passed away only nawal and bassam were left and we could not place them in any institution
8696919 we lock them up to keep them away from people and children out on the streets who could harm them we are not holding them prisoner
8696920 some people hide their mentally disabled children and dont speak about them because they are afraid this will harm their reputation
8696921 will not enter his plea to the indictement until the new one which he will be judged upon is finished

8696925 atletico madrid had ook zomaar in pot 2 in plaats van pot 4 kunnen zitten bij de loting het zijn hele mooie wedstrijden maar dit wordt heel zwaar
8696926 voor de rest zou ik niet kunnen voorspellen wie er doorgaat
8696927 jammer dat we atletico er nog bij kregen als je een kleine club uit pot 4 trekt heb je nog een goede loting nu is het erg zwaar liverpool is de favoriet maar daarachter zijn we met zijn drie n aan elkaar gewaagd

8696939 outgrowing homegrown is your in house billing system hampering your growth
8696940 one of the questions is why do they do it
8696941 do they do it because they believe twitter or facebook or blogs create more discourse and citizen engagement or do they do it because being in that world draws attention to the news media as being hip or technologically timely i have the sort of cynical suspicion that they do it for the latter reason more to appear current than it is for some strong romantic or moral belief that citizen contribution has an impact on a sense of self government
8696942 theres nothing wrong with old uses modified for the new channels of communications
8696943 but it is somewhat suspicious to say oh look how progressive the new technology is its an incremental improvement not some kind of magic silver bullet it does show that news organizations are really paying attention to this stuff the lesson learned from the early 90s when the web was new was that the news industry totally missed out it signals a shift to me that news organizations have recognized theyre going to think more about this stuff theyve recognized that they have to think more about technology in their strategic planning

8696987 its been a fantastic group i think this went off without a hitch
8696988 the past seven years of the bush regime have seen a dramatic escalation of attacks on immigrants on many fronts
8696989 obama has made no call to reverse this whole ugly program
8696990 stop the attacks on immigrants stop the ice raids stop the criminal bush program
8696991 we want to build bridges and not walls between our countries
8696992 we want pathways to citizenship we want to decriminalize immigration
8696993 we didnt know what happened to her something has to be done to open our borders i still have family members who come here to make a better life
8696994 there is no issue more important than how we care for immigrants
8696995 the way that families cannot be united is a problem as well as the way people have been criminalized and end up in jail
8696996 the goal is to teach history as it happens about the democratic process about social justice
8696997 i dont know how someone could stay home and watch dr phil with all this going on but they do
8696998 i think its a mistake on the part of a company to think that simply because they enroll that they are going to be protected from any kind of government audit or raid
8696999 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8697000 we have to have strong enforcement if were ever to have a chance for comprehensive reform
8697001 without very significant changes we would look at all options to stop a final rule including a court challenge
8697002 i think the general public thinks its an answer all to this whole illegal worker identity theft problem and its not
8697003 this should not be an arizona tucson or umc issue im sorry that the federal reimbursement is going to go away

8697006 if the patients are under arrest the border patrol has to pay for them
8697007 the arizona mexico commission serves as developing linkages and friendships when you need to work on the transfer piece
8697008 we particularly in our hospital here have developed a relationship with hospital general across the border
8697009 i think it would be helpful if there was a methodology and agreement developed between mexico and the united states on how patients would be transferred
8697010 it would be nice to say lets develop a system at this point everyone is doing the best they can

8697020 the basic problem that we all face nowadays is how to handle vast amounts of information at a sensible rate
8697021 the first idea of building the semantic desktop arose from the fact that one of our colleagues could not remember the girlfriends of his friends
8697022 because they kept changing you know how it is the point is you have a vast amount of on your desktop hidden in files hidden in emails hidden in the names and structures of your folders nepomuk gives a standard way to handle such information
8697023 the price good men pay for indifference to public affairs is to be ruled by evil men

8697045 we applaud the republican party and especially the members of the platform committee representing grassroots pro life republicans across the country for making such a strong and unequivocal stand supporting life at all stages
8697046 the work of the platform committee makes clear in no uncertain terms that the republican party is the pro life party
8697047 strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
8697048 the democrats have gone out of their way to alienate americas pro life majority by embracing the radical pro abortion agenda of barack obama
8697049 the republican party has once again demonstrated that it is completely in line with the majority of americans who oppose the vast majority of abortions
8697050 that speech was amazing but its not going to change my mind
8697051 i talk to plenty of people like me who just wont accept an unqualified president
8697052 obama has said a lot of stuff but nothing with a concrete vision
8697053 i have heard at least some sensible things from senator mccain hes a comeback kind of guy and ive heard from many other people who are clearly leaning in his direction
8697054 had it been a different republican democrats would not have been able to consider defecting so easily
8697055 but given the perception that mccain is a moderate there is a good chance that some clinton supporters will defect to him
8697056 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it

8697068 it is for the people building the new online tools to also develop and boldly evangelize ways of measuring the contributions made with the tools to understand what this means imagine youre a scientist sitting on a hiring committee thats deciding whether or not to hire some scientist their curriculum vitae reports that theyve helped build an open science wiki and also write a blog unfortunately the committee has no easy way of understanding the significance of these contributions a sk yourself what it would take for a description of the contribution made through blogging to be reported by a scientist on their curriculum vitae how could you measure the different sorts of contributions a scientist can make on a blog outreach education and research these are not easy questions to answer yet they must be answered before scientific blogging will be accepted as a valuable professional scientific contribution

8697109 the record presented demonstrates that far from encouraging copyright infringement veoh has a strong dmca policy takes active steps to limit incidents of infringement on its website and works diligently to keep unauthorized works off its website

8697251 our existing contracts are in place the volumes of what they are though have been reduced as demand has slowed

8697314 the junior senator from illinois continues to play defense rather than carry the fight to the republicans over say their central role in the foreclosure catastrophe a genuine national crisis obama lets his opponent shift the national spotlight onto phony issues such as support for offshore drilling as if lining our coastlines with oil rigs is somehow going to roll back the 4 gallon of gasoline or turn back the pace of global warming
8697315 economic anxiety is the new terrorism how we dig out of this quagmire is the american story that obama must tell it is not a story of endless conflicts abroad but a potentially inspiring tale of serious economic educational energy and health care mobilization at home we dont have the time or resources to go off on more quixotic military missions or to indulge in culture wars

8697323 sean was a part of our office and the loss is immeasurable our thoughts and prayers are with his wife and family
8697324 it is very rare i cant even remember a murder of a prosecutor in colorado this is a very heinous act ive already talked to a number of state and federal prosecutors everyone is very focused this is a reminder of how important the work of prosecutors is and that they are involved with dangerous and violent people

8697337 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8697338 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8697339 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8697340 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8697341 i was always impressed by his verbosity hes a skilled writer however its what he wrote about and how he framed his opinion that was absolutely disgraceful his arrogance is galling his attempts at being funny by injecting pop culture into his columns were embarrassing he doesnt deserve to write in a sports town like chicago

8697346 over four years several of these officials said operatives of the cia paid the tinners as much as 10 million some of it delivered in a suitcase stuffed with cash in return the tinners delivered a flow of secret information that helped end libyas bomb programme reveal irans atomic labours and ultimately undo dr khans nuclear black market
8697347 the tinners played an important role in a clandestine american operation to funnel sabotaged nuclear equipment to libya and iran a major but little known element of the efforts to slow their nuclear progress
8697348 the relationship with the tinners was very significant said gary s samore who ran the national security councils nonproliferation office when the operation began thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges which enrich uranium for nuclear fuel
8697349 the sabotage first came to light diplomats and officials said when inspectors from the international atomic energy agency traveled to iran and libya in 2003 and 2004 and discovered identical vacuum pumps that had been damaged cleverly so that they looked perfectly fine but failed to operate properly
8697350 a more serious disruption involved a power supply shipped to iran from turkey where dr khans network did business with two makers of industrial control equipment
8697351 the iranians installed the power supply at their uranium enrichment plant at natanz but in early 2006 it failed causing 50 centrifuges to explode a serious if temporary setback to irans efforts to master the manufacture of nuclear fuel the hardest part of building a bomb

8697358 if i had to hand out a rookie of the year award for hockey blogging for the 2006 07 nhl season one of the top contenders for the award would have to be the forechecker

8697360 under the collective bargaining agreement the players have no voice and no role in a technical manner as it pertains to relocation or expansion and we dont derive any financial benefit from that which i think is a mistake
8697361 but if youre in phoenix or youre in florida its really tough for those teams to put people in the seats and sell the game we understand that and maybe the revenue sharing system is part of the answer but our view is that if teams in any region suffer financial losses three or four years in a row then stop complaining about it in a business system you created and imposed here and start asking the question whether youre in the right place
8697362 you know i was a federal prosecutor for 10 years and a white collar practitioner for 12 years thereafter so i know a little bit about due diligence and financial fraud we at the nhlpa dont get involved with any of this but i think if someone is a sophisticated fraudster they can conceal anything from anybody its pretty hard to find

8697385 who is going to finance the nabucco project now let alone supply it with the gas it needs
8697386 we do not want to comment on the political or military situation
8697387 in any event we are optimistic that the project will go ahead
8697388 the countries involved in making nabucco happen and the eu should support the project and not be intimidated by russia
8697389 russia by creating the impression that the entire caucasus was now so unstable is exactly what it intended to do in order to destroy nabucco
8697390 it is still not clear which countries will supply nabucco with the gas and there are still problems with turkey
8697391 we provide millions of barrels of oil each month to china and the united states but dont have enough to fill up our own tanks
8697392 the oil industry wants stability and access to oil reserves and therefore an expected victory from the mpla party will be good news for them
8697393 the oil industry is not bound by ethical or moral constraints but by principles of profitability
8697394 all they want is for things to remain as they are
8697395 why should these oil companies want a change in government
8697396 assuming no unrest is associated with the elections the expectation is that the mpla will again dominate parliament and the process will pass peacefully i dont think much will change

8697440 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care

8697460 the clubs go back a long way and many celtic fans have a soft spot for united but of course they wont when we play them
8697461 we had two fantastic games with them two seasons ago losing 3 2 at old trafford and beating them 1 0 in glasgow to qualify for the last 16 and alex ferguson wont want a repeat of that defeat
8697462 the games against celtic will be huge i am sure the players and the fans are all looking forward to that one fixture in the calendar
8697463 even after seeing the teams we have to face you never know if it will be an easy first phase or a difficult one
8697464 our first aim is to get through the group our second is to try to finish first in group b certainly we are very motivated and confident we want to start playing in the champions league as quickly as possible

8697468 wenn man 22 jahre lang bei einem verein wie manchester united besch ftigt ist und mit all dem druck klarkommt dann muss man eine au ergew hnliche qualit t haben und ferguson hat diese qualit t ich habe viel respekt vor ihm und seinem team
8697469 diese anpassungsf higkeit von glasgow nach st petersburg zu gehen zwei v llig gegens tzlichen orten ist sehr bemerkenswert er hatte eine fantastische karriere und war immer kompetent sowie erfolgreich egal wo er war

8697513 ive been watching it and marking my calendar until dec 11
8697514 i think its going to be a good marriage us and sioux city this is my seventh olive garden and this is the one im most excited about
8697515 sioux citys business activity and growing population make it the perfect location for the newest member of olive gardens family of local restaurants
8697516 the decor the colors we just want to make it feel as warm as possible
8697517 our glassware and plateware is imported from italy we want to make it as traditional as possible
8697518 which is rustic charming and beautiful the perfect atmosphere to enjoy a genuine italian dining experience
8697519 we have probably 10 dishes that are actually inspired from that we have a culinary chef in the mountain area over there and she works with people from orlando company headquarters and they develop dishes and bring them back here
8697520 were known for our soup and salad specials we have three different kinds of soups soup and salad and breadsticks thats kind of our lunch staple everybody loves it and they always rave about it
8697521 we have anything from a chicken parmesan to my favorite the pork filettino
8697522 so if you come here you go to omaha or you go anywhere else that has an olive garden you should be able to sit down and have the same bowl of soup and have it taste the same
8697523 actually by the time people leave here hopefully theyre warm enough inside they forget about the weather
8697524 my biggest thing is to keep my employees happy make sure theyre having a good time that way i can make sure my guests are happy and having a good time
8697525 we dont want to open the doors until were ready
8697526 i dont want you to come in monday night and not have the service youre supposed to get and have the food not tasting quite right

8697531 let them keep the olive garden franchise but lift their voting franchise
8697532 great now i can go to taco bell for lunch and then for a fine dining experience i can head on over to the og
8697533 this might be the best restaurant review i have ever read
8697534 seriously if you havent already tried this place you should
8697535 how about a cracker barrell they have the best breakfast in the whole wide world
8697536 what is sioux citys obsession with the sub par itialian food served by olive garden
8697537 its clear that north carolina is being left behind while people like elizabeth dole choose politics over people to the detriment of working families across the state
8697538 how are families here supposed to get ahead when they are consistently ignored or cast aside altogether in favor of the washington special interests and their bottom lines dole has voted with president bush 92 of the time and its clear hes done nothing to help working families throughout his tenure so we shouldnt be surprised that dole hasnt either but its time north carolina has a voice that speaks for them not against them and someone who works to help them not hinder them
8697539 we need to level the playing field for families around here
8697540 we need to hold street dumpers accountable i live in berkeley and its rampant there along with old couches stained mattresses electronics etc with free signs

8697568 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8697569 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
8697570 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
8697571 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8697572 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8697573 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
8697574 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8697575 the fact that barack obama chose to launch his political career at the home of an unrepentant terrorist raises more questions about senator obamas judgment than any tv ad ever could
8697576 we reiterate our request that the department of justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the american issues project and we further request that the department of justice investigate and prosecute howard sic simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits
8697577 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech
8697578 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8697579 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8697580 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8697581 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8697582 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8697583 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8697584 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8697585 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
8697586 data from european demographers and statistical bureaus show that a majority of children in sweden and norway are now born out of wedlock as are 60 percent of first born children in denmark
8697587 kurtzs argument which oreilly embraces is that when legal rights are accorded to gays through some unspecified process heterosexual couples begin bearing children out of wedlock and refuse to marry when they otherwise would there are many government policies that alter the incentives to get and stay married and thus have direct and unsurprising effects on marriage for instance the availability of no fault divorce leads to more divorces and laws providing the same rights for cohabitating heterosexual couples as married couples lead to fewer marriages as couples make private commitments to each other without seeking the imprimatur of the state but neither kurtz nor oreilly has provided a plausible justification for their belief that extending rights to gay couples harms heterosexual marriage
8697588 back at national review online contributing editor stanley kurtz makes the same point
8697589 the replacement of a traditional ethic of sacrifice by a post 60s ethos of self fulfillment
8697590 nursing was once built around a spirit of feminine compassion and sacrifice in the new feminist world that is unacceptable
8697591 i think the vote of no confidence in lawrence summers is a wonderful thing harvard continues to discredit itself with the american public the faculty is trapped if summers resigns this extraordinary example of political correctness will come back to haunt harvard and the entire academy for years but if summers hangs on the faculty itself will have been humiliated checked by the very fact of public scrutiny either way harvard is tearing itself apart so long as the public simply writes of the academy the mice can play but the intense public scrutiny in this case puts the captains of political correctness into a no win situation like the closely watched susan estrich fiasco this battle is doing lasting damage to the cultural left as they say sunlight is the best disinfectant

8697600 this race is very precarious its very much in play
8697601 you tell me how big the obama surge is in north carolina and ill tell you how the senate race goes for hagan to be within five points of queen elizabeth at this point must make the republicans very nervous
8697602 is probably the best available candidate the democrats could have nominated but its still a pretty long shot for her to win
8697603 the national mood is clearly not in the republicans favor but dole is likely to outperform the gop brand in north carolina because she has major crossover appeal
8697604 anyone who thought dole was going to run away with the race just doesnt understand north carolina
8697605 if she has enough financial support i think she has a shot though shes going to have to work really hard to pull it off
8697606 if that number gets up to 23 percent the democrats win the state
8697607 the national democratic party used to be a drag on the state party but not this time
8697608 sacrificing your future for a slightly more comfortable present is not worth it if you keep building you can come back strong

8697852 these results showing the beneficial impact of alpharadin in terms of pain palliation are important as improved quality of life alongside increased survival are the two key goals of anti cancer therapy of patients with skeletal metastases
8697853 these results build on the positive phase ii clinical data package that we have already assembled with alpharadin the highlight of which was the significant survival benefits that we have already reported in patients with hrpc based on our clinical trials to date i am very confident that alpharadin has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with prostate cancer this view has been reinforced by the enthusiastic and positive response we have received from key opinion leaders around the world to our unique approach to treating hrpc
8697854 these data demonstrate that treatment with velcade plus melphalan and prednisone leads to a survival benefit and a high complete remission in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma

8697928 and yet as reported by several media outlets the obama campaign is engaged in a multi pronged effort to intimidate media outlets including radio and television stations into not airing information or advertisements focusing on the issue
8697929 the tennessee republican party rejects barack obamas view that the media should carry only good news about him and avoid delving into his murky past and we reject his campaigns effort to use the department of justice to persecute political opposition and suppress political speech an effort that ought to scare journalists and fans of the first amendment everywhere

8698008 as in all situations of loss the most significant issue for family and friends around divorce etiquette is being supportive available for what they need not necessarily what you think they need

8698026 there is frequently this debate about any addiction because addictions are normal behavior gone out of control and the debate is really about when you draw the line about out of control
8698027 addictions have been designated pathology in order to get insurance funding and some people maintain theres no disease only bad choices
8698028 i would term someones sexual behavior an addiction if its creating big problems in his or her life such as messing up career ruining relationships resulting in huge debt repeatedly creating medical problems or stds or resulting in arrest that last one is especially problematic because in some places behavior that is deemed normal gay sex sex with a 16 year old sex between consenting adults in arab countries is criminalized but those are the standard criteria for determining whether behavior is addictive if its a problem and you cant stop it its deemed addictive
8698029 its bandied about as a diagnosis but one of the problems with idea of sex addiction is that it is not as simple as being addicted to a drug or even addicted to running every day
8698030 sex is a complicated behavioral activity that has a lot of variables and another person often has to be involved
8698031 mostly when i think of something as an addiction its someone engaging in behavior that causes danger to self and or loved ones whatever it would be compromises their values
8698032 i pass no judgement on people with active sex drives who have sex with those who are appropriate and want to have sex
8698033 if someone realizes that they need a lot of sex and goes to swing parties thats not addiction
8698034 i largely feel we here in the west we have a lot of prudery around sexuality we think of some things as addiction
8698035 the umbrella that some people put it under is much too big for me
8698036 i just bristle at the word addiction i can say that there are patterns of behaviors patterns of pornographic behaviors that mirror addiction all factors involved in addiction happen in these types of activities being preoccupied or focused on sex sexual release or achieving orgasm it can look very much like addiction
8698037 my concern is people use the phrase sex addiction as an excuse for their irresponsible or immoral behavior if the adage for aa applies namely that i recognize that this is out of my control and this is a disease that abdicates personal responsibility in engaging in the sex act
8698038 i agree that there can be sex addiction but i think it is overly used perhaps it would apply in situations where they do culturally inappropriate behaviors with others who dont want to be a part of it such as pedophilia or rape where they dont think of the place or the person or with those who are exhibitionists and like masturbating in public or perhaps peeping toms it comes down to how to manage your sexuality i basically differ with some sexologists about this definition
8698039 i guess the distinguishing characteristic with sex for the sex addict would be relatively indiscriminate there would be no reason to continue with one partner versus another if only for the self gratifying act of having sex for the sex addict falling in love with someone only serves the purpose of actualizing his sexual needs it is secondary to sex

8698041 celebrities rightly or wrongly are role models for many people
8698042 their behaviors are modeled by others who admire them so when celebrities have children out of wedlock or enagage in infidelity or abuse some members of the population will model or imitate these behaviors similarly when celebrities adopt children from poor regions some members will do the same thing celebrities can be trendsetters for many behaviors and attitudes
8698043 sex is a very powerful urge and not too many people can resist it
8698044 monogamy is a lovely idea but it isnt very reality based
8698045 some couples can and do practice monogamy voluntarily and joyously because it comes naturally to them however the rest would benefit more from honesty than lets pretend monogamy
8698046 a marriage certificate is not for everyone nor is fidelity
8698047 it takes tremendous integrity more than most of us have at given times to risk losing that which you love by telling the truth so whether we make one little slip one night away from home after too much to drink or whether we have a long meaningful affair outside our primary relationship the human tendency is to cover up lie about it
8698048 youre going to be attracted to people in our marriage vows we didnt say forsaking all others the vow that we made was that you will never hear that i did something after the fact
8698049 if it came down to it then one can say to the other look i need to have sex with somebody im not going to if you dont approve of it but please approve of it
8698050 the strength of any relationship is measured by the honesty and commitment two people consistently show each other
8698051 in whichever way two people set up their boundaries if they keep their word to one another whether outsiders agree or not then the marriage is working this is america and people are free to engage in any number of marital permutations problems arise when a person discovers his her mate has gone back on his her promised word what most people want is trust because it gives them security

8698055 ideally every family should have a mother figure and a father figure it is what the legislature intended thus barring any unusual circumstances such as abuse domestic violence or a cross country move the default arrangement should always be joint physical and joint legal custody

8698058 there must be a substantial change in circumstances or a strong reason why the custodial arrangement should be changed from one parent to joint custody
8698059 joint legal custody is granted in excess of 95 percent of all divorces in michigan
8698060 courts are granting more and more joint physical custodial arrangements
8698061 some type of joint custodial arrangement is happening perhaps in as many as 25 percent or more of the divorce cases with children that i am involved in
8698062 the non custodial parent should always request joint legal custody legal custody is decision making power it governs decisions involving the health education and welfare of the child as a parent this is an important power and should never be waived

8698081 i congratulate south gloucestershire trading standards and local police for successfully shutting down gary boulters criminal operation
8698082 elspa would like to thank the efforts of everyone concerned in their attempts to protect legitimate local traders and remove illegal products from the marketplace
8698083 mr boulter has been dealt with severely by the court and this should stand as a stern warning to others who are tempted to engage in this type of activity
8698084 in our culture we have such an emphasis on one mother and one father
8698085 the traditional family roles are so ingrained in all of us
8698086 there is a disengaging pattern on the part of biological fathers when their ex wives remarry
8698087 there is not a context that allows for the same level of disengagement from the mother that we often see in fathers
8698088 after a great deal of anguish and consultation with my pastor and counselor i decided that it would be best for my son if i backed out of the picture
8698089 i found that she was taking our son to everyone and introducing her new husband as donalds new dad she was saying the same to him
8698090 she even got a counselor to work with donald to tell him that this was perfectly normal unfortunately there is no limit on the number of counselors who will back up anything the mother wants to do
8698091 this was the toughest decision i have ever made i am hoping that at some time he will come around to ask why i left and i can show him the papers regarding how she asked the court to terminate my parental rights
8698092 i dont think i ever had a single client come to see me for an initial appointment who did not balk at the cost
8698093 the divorce organizer amp planner and the complete divorce handbook
8698094 most attorneys require a retainer up front and then bill hourly getting that retainer together is hard enough for most people but coping with the monthly bills afterward can be overwhelming
8698095 detail and write down all of the shared and individual liabilities that exist
8698096 settle or get a judgment on how youll allocate these liabilities
8698097 there are some very important implications if a spouse does not meet his her end of the bargain on liabilities allocated through the divorce proceedings
8698098 if your spouse does not make payments after the divorce it could come back to haunt you and your credit rating
8698099 if you find yourself in trouble during this stressful time in which you must make many financial decisions seek help immediately from a reliable professional debt resolution firm
8698100 being a single parent is difficult and divorce creates two single parents
8698101 you no longer have that dual parent tag team to fall back on where one parent can step in when the other is tired angry or frustrated
8698102 sometimes just differences in parenting styles can cause an impression of child abuse or neglect
8698103 its not necessarily abuse or neglect if your ex and the new family allow your child to do something differently than you would allow
8698104 children can easily adapt to two sets of household rules in fact they do it all the time they know to behave differently between their friends house home and their grandmas for example it isnt a big deal unless you or your ex makes it a big deal
8698105 for example one parent may believe in spanking and the other be totally against it
8698106 its the very rare parent that thinks they need to verify their childs claim
8698107 you are too close to the divorce drama to do a fair assessment so if you are out there really looking for signs of abuse odds are youll probably find something to fit the bill

8698116 my husband is gay a womans guide to surviving the crisis
8698117 when your spouse comes out a straight mates recovery manual
8698118 you realize that this person you are married to is not who you thought they were
8698119 you may still love him or her but suddenly you realize you were in love with someone who might not really quite exist thats a huge shock
8698120 the straight spouse feels as if they werent enough before he or she realizes they didnt have anything to do with the sexual orientation of their mate
8698121 such as keeping the knowledge of being gay secret for some time experimenting sexually outside the marriage or by buying into religious and societal views that being gay is immoral
8698122 after the disclosure the homosexual usually feels some level of repentance for the impact of their previous closeting
8698123 on the other hand most straight spouses feel self blame before the disclosure and some feel moral compunction right before the decision to divorce
8698124 its more likely that the gay spouse feels the most guilt due to issues surrounding deception affairs and breaking up the family
8698125 sometimes the gay spouse also feels guilt over the risk of carrying stds or aids to the straight spouse which is a real possibility and does happen
8698126 at first the straight spouse may feel inadequate like there is something wrong with him or her
8698127 that is a different feeling than guilt its the whole idea of not being good enough but in my experience ive seen those feelings pass pretty quickly in my case when i learned that the person my husband was involved with was a man i realized i cant compete with that if it had been another woman i would have tried to win him back
8698128 the straight spouse may blame themselves during the marriage for sexual problems with lovemaking that were actually caused by the gay or lesbian spouses lack of sexual desire
8698129 frustrated as they vainly try ways to attract their gay spouses they believe they are the ones at fault
8698130 one is a common request by the homosexual partner to not tell anyone that they are gay
8698131 keeping the secret lying to friends and family and or covering up the situation publicly cause pangs of guilt for straight spouses
8698132 she and chris want to live together they play their music loud though so they want a condo that s soundproof

8698136 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i know i am being used i am just a pawn easy to sacrifice in order to feed his addiction i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him
8698137 i dont know if its going to work with the story and we dont want her to come back for a visit if it doesnt feel important something only addison can do

8698177 we have our computer area open all hours that were open and we keep that space unmonitored and many different people have come through here in the last 30 years
8698178 but i can say that theyve been working very hard since the release of shadow of the colossus
8698179 tokyos more focused on consumers so were still working on the intricacies
8698180 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control
8698181 i go to church i go and help people in rehab thats control how can she say im out of control
8698182 i want lindsay to be in a good place when i started looking at what samantha was doing dragging lindsay to clubs drinking around lindsay samantha is one of the biggest problems in her life thats what dina told me im reacting on what dina said but then dina steps out of the picture because she wants to look like the good guy
8698183 dinas a two face she wants to try to look good and stay on lindsays good side instead of being a good parent i dont give two hoots about my relationship with lindsay as a friend one day shes going to turn around to me and tell me daddy you were right
8698184 if theyre going to say im lying im out of control im going to show that theyre lying and theyre out of control
8698185 i regret my actions i want to apologize for these actions i take full responsibility for these actions
8698186 lost its focus at least in part because of the influence of alcohol
8698187 the situation in the region should be resolved in dialogue
8698188 ive got a 3 year old daughter and i figure that every plane we build engines for has someone with a 3 year old daughter riding on it
8698189 it cant be more than four 1 000ths of an inch out of round
8698190 this has never been four 1 000ths of an inch out of true in the four years ive been measuring these
8698191 i came from northrop grumman in palmdale california where i was working on the b 2 bomber
8698192 that plane which used stealth technology was as high tech as you can get but someone else wrote the assembly process here i write the process at the mechanic level there i was on a team but i also had a supervisor he had a boss and there were other bosses above him in two years of working there i never saw the plant manager every day my boss would just hand me my job i had no input at all none im much happier here i can change what goes on
8698193 my old faithful working as a laborer at a shipyard
8698194 but i never even gave it any thought i didnt know if i was up for it but a job i was up for that
8698195 the interview now that was one heck of an experience
8698196 it lasted eight hours i talked to five different people i participated in three group activities with other job candidates i even had to do a presentation i had 15 minutes to prepare a 5 minute presentation
8698197 my first six months at the plant were something i wasnt prepared for
8698198 we had to come up with a schedule we had the chance to order tools tool carts and so on we had to figure out how the assembly line to make the engine should flow we were put on councils for every part of the business
8698199 i was never valued that much as an employee in my life
8698200 i had never been at the point where i couldnt wait to get to work but here i couldnt wait to get to work every day thats no bs
8698201 but weve had training on how to reach consensus weve had training on how to live with ideas that we might not necessarily agree with
8698202 all the things you normally fuss and moan about to yourself and your buddies well we have a chance to do something about them
8698203 you dont hoard your skills that way when im on vacation the low pressure turbine can still be built without me
8698204 there should be no reason for barriers between people here
8698205 one we have a layerless organization there is just one classification of worker two people are paid according to their skills three everyone is an faa power plant mechanic meaning that he or she comes highly skilled and four this is a team environment that requires a highly involved workforce
8698206 you have to be above the bar in all 11 of the areas helping skills team skills communication skills diversity flexibility coaching ability work ethic and so forth even if just one thing out of the 11 knocks you down you dont come to work here
8698207 we ask for instance if there were something in your past that you could change what would it be
8698208 we wouldnt hire donald trump here but that doesnt mean he isnt good at what he does
8698209 but when you put someone with the new guy you cant expect that person to get as far as he would if you put him with an experienced guy as the materials council rep keith did the right thing by confronting me and i did the right thing by confronting him back by explaining it was friendly
8698210 an employee came to me and said paula you realize that you dont need to follow up with us to make sure were doing what we agreed to do
8698211 how do we do that engine which weve never done before and do it fast we were going to do it with just one new team and with no new hires
8698212 they have been producing the cfm engine for eight weeks
8698213 in evendale we have been producing it for years and years and in durham they are already producing it for 12 to 13 less cost than we are here
8698214 and we call it an a decision it was a unilateral decision i dont make very many of those and when i do make one everyone at the plant knows it
8698215 i make maybe 10 or 12 of those a year
8698216 they sell for less this year than last year and that has been true for the past five years in a row to sustain our business we have to reduce our costs every year the nice thing is that here instead of one person saying mush harder everyone has 15 people looking at them 15 peers to whom they are accountable
8698217 each team or group of teams may be optimizing itself but whats the right way to optimize the plant if weve optimized each engine program how do i free up resources for growth and for process improvement
8698218 they financial incentives are not part of the culture at ge aircraft engines
8698219 then as new work becomes available we have the potential to bid on it internally and to get it
8698220 the idea of being the boss having a big office or whatever doesnt turn me on
8698221 it never really has ive had a nice big office and i felt uncomfortable removed from what was going on but i know im the boss here it comes out in funny ways i hadnt been here long before i started hearing the phrase paula says after awhile it became a joke
8698222 i had never worked in this kind of environment before
8698223 the workforce is highly skilled and highly motivated and highly demanding as well it is demanding of information time resources results i consider that a good thing because a lot of managers ive talked to are lulled to sleep by the layers of insulation around them but with 170 people reporting to you you really have to balance face time with getting your work done
8698224 has been the most challenging four years of my life and also the most rewarding to do it well requires a different level of listening skills significantly different
8698225 more and more of what i do involves listening to people to teams to councils to ideas trying to find common themes
8698226 the beauty of this job is that there are very few limits that youd associate with its structure or its responsibilities
8698227 when there were some big budget challenges we wanted to reduce costs at this facility by 1 2 million and we wanted a plan to do it in a few days id been through this kind of thing many times in many different places but id never been through it here before
8698228 at the time this plant wasnt very cost conscious so i formed an expense council to educate people at the facility about why keeping track of expenses is important and how expenses fit into the total scheme of things
8698229 it was a real rudder change to get the plant to focus on expenses
8698230 that was the year when everyone decided that i was a cheap skate but in a place like this you have to trust people to a degree that you never would have before
8698231 when i had a new plan i called my boss back and said take that first plan i sent you and throw it in the trash
8698232 we are very close to producing twice the output of cf6s from this plant with the same number of employees as when i came here
8698233 they are the best in the ge aircraft engines division
8698234 they used to go up on ladders to work on those engines
8698235 the ge90 teams said could we build some platforms i said thats a great idea once we decided on a design it took a month to build the first one and now we have two not having to climb up and down the ladder or to move it each time you need to reach something new has reduced the assembly time of the engine by eight hours
8698236 we have method engineers and process engineers and you give them a job and they hem and haw for a year and then they come up with something
8698237 now down in durham you dont hear about process improvement they are constantly swinging away at it every time i go down there im amazed they have their washers all sorted into holders like poker chips sorted into trays you can easily get the washer you want its things like that they dont ask anybody they just go and do it down there you can get more going in a weeks time than you can here in a year
8698238 i think what theyve discovered in durham is the value of the human being

8698249 team obama has become so overwrought at the mere thought of criticism that they now overreact on a constant basis
8698250 we have been so lucky and at the end of the day it could have been a lower medal and that would have been nice but there is nothing like gold
8698251 beef and lamb have become less expensive compared with other competitors
8698252 that does not mean they are cheaper but the difference is less we have had increases over the years particularly lamb when prices improved offshore but the price of chicken has become much pricier through feed prices
8698253 a fresh vegetable dug straight out of the garden is going to be a bit better but if it sits on a shelf for two to three weeks sometimes frozen vegetables are better because they are often frozen within two hours
8698254 i feel the way it has been said in the radios and newspapers is that people are on the wrong perception
8698255 we cannot even get a tractor on the ground and we do not know when we will be planting stuff we will not be moving until september 10 as long as the weather clears
8698256 we got a decent boost from the stimulus which hit the economy at a time when we really needed it
8698257 it will have less of an impact going forward though and we may even have a payback in the fourth quarter
8698258 we would have had growth even without the stimulus as much of the rise in gdp had to do with the trade deficit
8698259 without a price spiral the fed wont have to squeeze the life out the economy which should help sustain modest economic growth
8698260 because of that we have found that cheaper imports from low cost countries are becoming more attractive to new zealand importers
8698261 my message is that we need to support our new zealand growers and we need to expect to pay a little more for new zealand grown quality produce that you can rely upon for taste and safety
8698262 new zealand growers have to add value not volume and get smarter and use technology and innovation and pull out all the stops to keep us going forward the next 20 years
8698263 obviously its a subordinated debt loan that they had so it wasnt a question of us needing a change between equity and debt though thats always nice
8698264 we pride ourself on having a clean green image but it is severely tested by our major export industry adopting this as a standard for processing dairy farm effluent would reap major international accolades
8698265 as far as we know this is an unique system
8698266 you can find ice banks in dairies for rapid cooling of milk although it may not be done automatically and you will find biogas producing electricity on farms but to my knowledge no one has integrated the whole system
8698267 when cows are put into housed fed situations they will produce 20 per cent more milk they are healthier and they will last 20 per cent longer

8698273 i appreciate there are differences of opinion about how it should work
8698274 to unify growers and consolidate the clip they should have an ownership stake in the business beyond the farm gate
8698275 thats the only way well get farmers to actually invest in brands into the market
8698276 we could survive but i am not going to pay carbon tax on my animals farting and burping
8698277 i will kill all of them before i do that if it goes to that level too right
8698278 i cannot accept a tax on animals doing a natural thing
8698279 they have evolved over thousands of years burping and farting and to think we can change that in a short time is stupid several hundred years ago there would probably have been more animals than today
8698280 farmers do not think it will happen but once it is legislated the tax has to be paid and if you do not pay the ird will send you a penalty and another demand and then we are dealing with a faceless bureaucracy
8698281 the money should stay here to develop our own country
8698282 this is a giant leap into the abyss heres hoping we do not kill the golden goose
8698283 florenz darf nicht untersch tzt werden obwohl sie nur in topf vier waren steaua kann ich nicht einsch tzen es h tte leichter kommen k nnen gegen lyon haben wir 2001 0 3 verloren und dann doch die champions league gewonnen so kann es wieder kommen
8698284 diese gruppe hat es in sich lyon ist ein brocken florenz hat seinen reiz durch luca toni es wird eine sehr sehr spannende angelegenheit aber wir freuen uns sehr auf die spiele in der champions league
8698285 nach der vergangenen saison im uefa cup freue ich mich jetzt noch mehr auf die champions league wir k nnen uns endlich wieder mit topmannschaften messen der fc bayern ist wieder da angekommen wo er hingeh rt wir wollen jetzt richtig angreifen
8698286 ich h tte lieber gegen eine andere gro e mannschaft wie chelsea manchester oder arsenal gespielt aber nicht gegen lyon aus eigener erfahrung wei ich nur zu gut dass das eine sehr gute mannschaft ist die schwer zu schlagen ist
8698287 das wird schwierig aber nicht nur f r uns wir haben im letzten jahr den deutschen meister stuttgart geschlagen weshalb soll uns das nicht auch mit dem meister bayern gelingen insgesamt ist die gruppe sehr ausgeglichen
8698288 wir sind zufrieden auch wenn die gruppe auf dem ersten blick nicht spektakul r erscheint ist sie interessant inter mailand ist eine gro e herausforderung die griechen k nnen sehr unangenehm sein mit der berraschung famagusta erleben unsere fans eine premiere auch das hat seinen reiz ich w rde l gen wenn ich behaupten w rde dass wir die aufgabe nicht l sen k nnen
8698289 diese auslosung hat einen gro en reiz wir m ssen diese gruppe sehr engagiert angehen und d rfen sie auf keine fall untersch tzen famagusta k nnnen wir nicht einsch tzen sie haben aber viel geleistet um hier mitspielen zu k nnen sie waren gegen rapid wien und olympiakos pir us krasse au enseiter
8698290 you might have to edit the forgiveness part of the cd you went a little crazy
8698291 well there was the part when you said that telling people to forgive can be arrogant then you said that in our culture we have a hard time of letting go when we really want to kick someones ass and they actually deserve to have their ass kicked you also said that its almost like forgiveness is un american
8698292 you might be the only mental health professional ive heard who didnt preach about forgiveness with certainty and more importantly one of the only ones who didnt tell me that i cant heal until i totally forgive thank you
8698293 hmm whats worse an affair or losing a parent in an accident or having a parent who was distant or having a child who was hurt
8698294 i shouldnt complain look how much worse she has it
8698295 interpersonal forgiveness is a willingness to abandon ones right to resentment negative judgment and indifferent behavior toward one who unjustly injured us while fostering undeserved qualities of compassion generosity and even love toward him or her
8698296 so and so made me so mad and i dont want to get over it because she was wrong it feels good to be right even when its keeping me angry and tired
8698297 however when i talk of forgiveness i mean the belief that you can come out the other side a better person a better person than the one being consumed by anger and hatred remaining in that state locks you in a state of victimhood making you almost dependent on the perpetrator if you can find it in yourself to forgive then you are no longer chained to the perpetrator you can move on and you can even help the perpetrator to become a better person too
8698298 well this is who i am and you should be used to it by now
8698299 they were devastated so we closed the set immediately as people were trying to come to terms with the tragedy

8698403 our own observatory at armagh is one of the oldest in the world and has been observing solar cycles for more than 200 years what this work has shown is that over all of this time short and intense cycles coincide with global warmth and long and weak cycles coincide with cooling most recently this pattern continued in the 1980s and 1990s when cycles 21 and 22 were short less than 10 years and intense and it was notably hot but all this now looks set to change cycle 23 which hasnt finished yet looks like it will be long at least 12 to 13 years and cycle 24 which has still to start looks like it will be exceptionally weak based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years however temperatures have already fallen by about 0 5 degrees c over the past 12 months and if this is only the start of it it would be a serious concern northern ireland is not noted for extreme warmth at the best of times and has much more to fear from cold weather than it does from hot we really need to be sure what is going to happen before spending too much money on combating global warming we may need all the money we can save just to help us keep warm

8698440 rock solid images recently concluded a successful study of one of our key drilling prospects in west africa this work unequivocally demonstrated the impact that rigorous rock physics analysis can make on risk reduction in rank exploration areas such as those that characterize our deepwater west african and ukrainian exploration portfolios this multi year agreement with rock solid images demonstrates vancos commitment to deploy advanced modeling and inversion technologies for prospect high grading and risk mitigation
8698441 it is gratifying that our decision to focus on rock properties studies in west africa has been vindicated through an endorsement by one of the leading deepwater acreage holders in sub saharan africa we were able to effectively demonstrate the crucial role that rock physics plays in unraveling the oftentimes subtle interplay between reservoir properties and seismic expression we are looking forward to the technical collaboration and hope to be able to make a substantial contribution to vancos operational successes in both deepwater west africa and ukraine
8698442 we are delighted to have been awarded this contract with bp this contract is a result of our continuing ability to deliver complex subsea projects safely and on time within budget and to the highest standards this combined with our expertise as solution providers aligns our world class skills and technology with the needs of our clients ensuring that acergy delivers exactly what is required on this key field development project with bp

8698444 it has rained by the bounty of allah and his mercy
8698445 there is strong connection between birth order and divorce rates
8698446 this has been studied very well from a psychological stand point the most successful marriages are those where the oldest sister of brothers marries the youngest brother of sisters
8698447 think about it the older sister of brothers all her life has been taking care of little boys growing up the youngest brother of sisters all his life he has been taken care of by older sisters its a natural fit and there is a direct positive correlation between their place in their birth families and the stability of their marriage
8698448 when you get two first borns together they tend to be bossy they are typically the movers and the shakers the perfectionists of the world first borns are leaders
8698449 when you talk marriages of first borns that is two sheep butting heads for territorial rights its a bad match
8698450 a first born is much better with a baby notice there are extremes here babies of families they are the little schnookies they are the playful ones who always got away with murder they often are laid back and manipulative
8698451 there is an interesting phenomenon that happens with the baby of the family he is the last to leave and parents will create more of a dependency in order to keep what looms large at bay which is namely going back to their adult life without kids its scary so they will often that last child around longer keep him more dependent and those traits will spill over into his marriage which if he marries a first born daughter can work out quite nicely as both all their needs are met
8698452 the highest divorce rates are when an only child marries an only child
8698453 it makes sense when you think about it an only child is used to being the center of attention and when the only child marries another only child usually its hard for them to share the spotlight
8698454 if you want the job done right hire the only child these are very capable people they do extremely well in life because they are pretty much little adults by the time they are five six and seven years of age
8698455 but you dont want them marrying each other that can be very hard especially when they turn the spotlight of their perfection on each other and find some flaws
8698456 the thing about birth order isnt so much about who came out of the womb first but who are the children modeling first borns and onlies have as models their parents who are adults to be blunt our parents practiced on them they were their little guinea pigs
8698457 my grandparents were very indulgent of me i had anything i wanted when i wanted it i was very mature and spent a lot of time with adults old adults my grandparents friends

8698464 its a very laid back and easy going experience people realize when they come into this program theyre going to get out of it what they put in it

8698466 quarter by quarter analysis of dhs spending through eagle since its inception shows the use of the vehicle has ramped dramatically compared to some other task order vehicles making eagle too important for technology vendors to ignore especially in fourth quarter fiscal 2008
8698467 eagle may very well be the place dhs buyers go to use it or lose it in the fourth quarter
8698468 it provides dhs program offices and contracting officers with a fast and flexible procurement vehicle that is consistent with the dhs enterprise architecture
8698469 this allows them to quickly and effectively obligate fourth quarter funds dhs has several on going eagle procurements that should be awarded prior to the end of the fiscal year
8698470 run dont walk to dhs to look for 4q eagle spending
8698471 and certainly you cant make a marriage better by adding a whole nother person into the mix
8698472 i think when people get to the desperate stage thats when they start to do all kinds of dramatic gestures to stave off the apparently inevitable disaster at all costs
8698473 that usually means that the switch has been flipped by the time the person says they will leave
8698474 once that switch has been flipped its pretty hard for the switch flipper to flip it back
8698475 thats a really bad way to get the relationship back
8698476 its really rare for people who have reached a crisis to be able to put it back together without outside help

8698478 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
8698479 the first right presented in this list is the right to life from conception to its natural end 318 which is the condition for the exercise of all other rights and in particular implies the illicitness of every form of procured abortion and of euthanasia
8698480 as we well know anybody trying to find where the church says that abortion is morally acceptable or can be allowed in certain situations or is just another issue open to debate is going to fail miserably which is probably why biden and co dont bother to quote from the compendium of the social doctrine of the church
8698481 between those who accept and understand that certain matters of faith and morals are settled and those who think that it is ones all powerful conscience that makes the final decision even while paying lip service to loving the church
8698482 perhaps biden pelosi and others do suffer from invincible ignorance or perhaps they are simply denying or ignoring what they know the church does clearly teach
8698483 regardless any child receiving decent catechesis and anyone capable of reading the english language should recognize that senator bidens beliefs are not totally consistent with catholic social doctrine
8698484 if i am president advancing the cause of life will not be above my pay grade
8698485 when i began i had very little computer programming experience knowing what i needed i waded through java gui tutorials only to be continually faced with frustratingly confusing java jargon i needed a programming environment designed to give graphic feedback instead of visual feedback processing an open source programming environment built on top of java turned out to be a perfect fit for the project

8698487 making over your wardrobe is a great way to start fresh treat yourself to something nice and give your self confidence a boost
8698488 its an opportunity to re assess how you want to present yourself and explore aspects of your personal style that you have otherwise ignored neglected or been criticized for
8698489 giving the old clothing collection a makeover can make you concentrate on the future certain outfits and even individual items can bring back painful memories and they can chain you to the being you were before during and even after the divorce
8698490 new clothing and accessories help you to focus on creation after the procedure of dismantling and destruction and this is a positive way to start rebuilding
8698491 a man with a look of confidence and attention to detail without being too metrosexual is a very attractive quality

8698501 we have got to come up and play some good cricket
8698502 the pressure is on england to win the series i think its going to be a tough couple of games
8698503 the way people reacted when we walked off the field and they booed thats more than enough motivation for the guys to put in a big performance
8698504 weve been in this situation before we turned that around so we fully believe we can do it again its an ideal opportunity for me
8698505 weve got some work to do were by no means out of this series we can still come back and win this 3 2 but were going to have to play really well
8698506 i think england are a very good one day side i think theyve made a conscious decision to maybe get rid of their bits and pieces players
8698507 when theyre all firing and all fit they have specialists in their team that make them one of the best one day sides in the world theyre looking a very very good side and they are being very very well led at the moment
8698508 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant

8698517 air france klm confirms its interest and its wish to continue as the strategic partner for alitalia
8698518 with this in mind and if prospects for the new company are confirmed air france klm is ready to take a minority stake in the capital of the new company alongside the investors gathered together by italian bank intesa sanpaolo
8698519 we received the information from the italian authorities in the form of a draft text for the privatisation plans for alitalia

8698533 from seven in the afternoon until three in the morning
8698534 victor is dead his body has been found in the morgue you must come because unless his body is claimed they will take him away and bury him in a common grave
8698535 the important thing is in our country we do have trials going on we are advancing and under my government we will still advance on three great principles truth justice and reparation for all the victims all the families of the victims we have been walking in that direction and i will do all my efforts to continue in that direction i mean no impunity no because im a doctor i know when you have an injury it will heal if its clean enough to heal if your injury is dirty it wont heal and so when you are talking in societies we are also talking in healing processes and for a good healing process you need to make things right
8698536 the people at the top of the chain of command a chain which in the case of victor jara and other victims of the pinochet regime leads all the way from chile to 1600 pennsylvania avenue in washington d
8698537 i think that the professional soldier from the fact of wearing a uniform and having power over the rest of the contingent loses the sense of his own class i think the exercise of command makes him consciously or unconsciously put himself on a different plane and see life from a different point of view he believes himself to be superior as a shaven headed private i remember having to polish an officers boots or do the cleaning in his house and i thought it very natural indeed i thought it almost a privilege to be called upon to do it because it meant that i was a very disciplined bloke who could be trusted to do the job properly but looking at it now without innocence i think it was a conditioning it conditions the servility of the private just as it conditions the superiority of the officer

8698628 the difficult economy is taking a toll on companies all around the country and is particularly affecting our company in florida

8698648 his obamas accomplishments are nonexistent or essentially nonexistent and he hasnt run anything
8698649 he hasnt been an executive or been in charge of anything and lastly the big problem or one of the big problems facing our country is the ability to work across party lines and get things done john mccain actually has a record in that regard barack obama does not he has good oratory but when you shut the teleprompter off theres not much else there
8698650 it looks like they are getting ready for the emperor to arrive
8698651 the facade is metaphor for production purposes but theres not much behind it its the perfect metaphor for barack obamas readiness to be president of the united states
8698652 republican strategist karl rove called sen joseph i lieberman i conn late last week and urged him to contact john mccain to withdraw his name from vice presidential consideration according to three sources familiar with the conversation

8698656 with this agreement we can immediately deliver an automated walk away solution for cell analysis to meet the ever increasing need for higher throughput cell biology that many labs face in todays environment of fast paced answer focused and efficiency conscious research
8698657 nothing pleases us more than to meet customer needs and now with hudson not only can we do that right away we can also pursue development of even higher value automated solutions going forward
8698658 we have already worked in partnership with hudson to install this new system in several drug discovery labs
8698659 so far response has been fantastically positive customers are very enthusiastic that we added walk away automation to support higher throughput research without sacrificing our friendly turnkey approach to cellular analyses
8698660 hudson is very excited to work with guava technologies to develop innovative solutions that will accelerate results for researchers working in cellular analysis by integrating our microplate robot for plate feeding and our liquid handling and scheduler products with guava r systems we deliver a level of automation for cell analysis beyond what is currently available and together we offer life scientists higher value solutions for high throughput cell analysis than each company could offer independently

8698663 framed the case for sen barack obama and against the republicans in a way that no one at this convention had done before
8698664 always finds a path to redemption when he is down and in many ways he proved that again with this speech and he might also have accomplished something larger and less self centered by doing all he could to bring obama up at the same time
8698665 bill clinton did for obama what obama has not been able to do for himself millions of democratic votes are now his to win or lose this is not an analysis but a lackluster summary of the best speech anyone will hear this year or for many a year
8698666 when we are able to put the common good ahead of the demands of our contracted and insatiable egos our true nature our essence radiates and brings light and hope to all thank you bill thank you hillary
8698667 great speech by a great democrat and an even greater statesman never in doubt the democratic party is a cause not a personality cult
8698668 will never get my vote give us a candidate we know we can believe in where are you jesse jackson when we need you 1 write in hillary 2008
8698669 too bad the dems have once again nominated the wrong person joe biden does not help his speech this evening was ridiculous hillary had my vote not the new democatic party
8698670 hillary ran a great race but she lost too little to late now obama is the nominee period please understand that this is so much bigger that womens rights its about saving this country before it too late and one more term in office with someone that is like bush will do it
8698671 do you really think that senator clinton wants you to vote mccain in for 4 more years of this downward spiral we have been in for 7 so she can run again in 2012 and if so how could you support someone who would want that for this country
8698672 i hope those hillary supporters will let go of their bitterness just as hillary was gracious and person enough to do not for themseleves or hillary but for the good of their country
8698673 after yesterday and tonight i do not believe the republicans will be so anxious to use senator clinton or president clinton to attack senator obama
8698674 what bill clinton failed to mention is that obama has no experience in governing in leading people obama may be an intelligent good looking guy who can read a teleprompter well but his credentials to govern this nation are nonexistent what are the democrats thinking or perhaps smoking
8698675 senator obama may become president of the united states but it is crystal clear that senator hillary rodham clinton and former president bill clinton are the reigning queen and king of dignity and the democratic party
8698676 last night i watched bill once again give a speech which showed a grace that clinton haters would choke to death before admitting this country should not have to undergo another 4 years with bushs proxy mccain in the oval office
8698677 as an inexperienced first term democratic president bill clinton did nothing about february 26 1993 that is the day the world trade center was attacked the first time by osama bin laden bill clinton had 100 opportunities to take out this menace and he treated the wtc bombing like a nyc crime instead of an international attack both bill and barack suffer from hubris and fpdd foreign policy deficit disorder
8698678 clintons speech was the dagger in the neo cons heart even karl rove was babbling incoherently afterwords
8698679 there are two facts americans can believe status quo politics and there is nothing so constant as change
8698680 all year long bill and hill said it loud and clear obama is not fit to lead so did biden
8698681 every day it seems like im in sort of a dream world
8698682 to raise the bar a bit more in the world of swimming
8698683 this is an exciting day for hockey fans in alberta and throughout canada
8698684 the bid group from alberta put forward a great plan and the site selection committee was particularly impressed with the bids focus on making tickets affordable for all hockey fans
8698685 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8698686 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8698687 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8698688 the volunteers have been deployed to assist the passengers weve got our food providers helping them out with snacks and stuff to try and make the best of a very challenging situation for them
8698689 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors
8698690 we are ready we are well organized we are determined to win this election
8698691 i think we had good reason not to trigger an election before canadians learned more about what this government represents
8698692 the whole reason i came on here was to get exposure and to show people something
8698693 people get all sad like this is the end or something or you just disappear off the planet or something but its not like that like i said before its just another stepping stone you just continue on you have your direction you want to go and nothing can sway your dream of what you want everything to be so you just continue on the path and see what happens maybe winning wouldve been the most detrimental thing in the world you dont even know really whatever happens you just accept it
8698694 from being three years ago i wouldnt even sing to anyone to jumping off the stage and mumbling words its wild really
8698695 youre unabashed youre uninhibited youre just out here to be earl quintessential earl i love it
8698696 i dont know you know theres such a large demographic this show its from tots to old people grandmas great grandmas even so you can expect that if youre really going to do what you want to do you can expect that just like in life anyones whos strong in what they do theres going to be people who dont agree with them for me music i just want to have fun i want to connect with all sides of myself
8698697 i fed off him a little bit he fed off me because were just kind of the same idea you know you can tell when people are just kind of floating the same way so i think me and mookie might do some stuff in the future were planning on maybe moving in together so hopefully well just have a huge jam room in our house and it will be soundproof so we wont wake up the neighbors and well have some producing stuff with the computer yeah just go to town on it try to get our own things going
8698698 it was crazy from the second i woke up that morning to the second i went to bed you know there was something about every 10 minutes i was going to have to do you know talk on a radio station talk on tv go home to thousands of people so a day like that is just out of this world because its a big deal to talk on a radio station for 10 minutes and just do one of them in a day so to do 50 things in a day is just like craziness
8698699 i wasnt able to finish the season last year and i want to finish the season
8698700 if youve been doing the same thing for a long time its hard to do
8698701 but if its going to make him back to the player he was in 2004
8698702 everybody is out there for one reason thats to try to get to october and the playoffs
8698703 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad its very dangerous and a mistaken policy
8698704 it that was the case then the recent events could have a american domestic political dimension
8698705 i dont think this issue is a small matter its best to look at it in its complexity
8698706 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8698707 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8698708 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8698709 were glad to see were in the forecast path because they never get it right this far out
8698710 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8698711 your message should be it is now under investigation and anyone who has any specific knowledge about the break out should contact the investigators
8698712 with notes indicating that in fact we do not have a gang or violence issues in our provincial correctional system
8698713 securing the future the saskatchewan partys plan and new ideas
8698714 hiring more corrections workers to eliminate drugs and gangs in jails
8698715 banning gang colours and paraphernalia in jails by instituting jail uniforms
8698716 delegats will continue their programme of acquiring land and developing vineyards to meet the needs and also we see real opportunity to continue to grow our independent grape grower base we are a growth stock and we will take every opportunity to grow our business incrementally
8698717 when you get onto retail shelves and you return a high rate of sale big retailers embrace you because youre the brand that generates them the most gross profit margin
8698718 effectively the nzru will be paying for the players payments
8698719 if we didnt they would not have been able to carry on and we would have been up for that amount to pay the players anyway
8698720 we dont want the competition to be disrupted and tasman if it withdrew could have impacted on other provincial unions
8698721 we are seeking further information before we think about challenging the nzru
8698722 itll help us sell a hell of a lot more xero licences and it will help sell more acclipse licences and all of us will have a much better relationship with all our clients its one of those true win win type deals
8698723 each accountant works with hundreds of small businesses so its a very leveraged opportunity for us
8698724 acclipse shares our vision of making it easier for small businesses to be successful and empowering accountants to be the trusted adviser to small business
8698725 the crusaders along with the new zealand rugby union have said that i can still help out to some degree
8698726 but thats probably only one day a week with the tasman side
8698727 ill be helping them out as much as i can along with fulfilling my crusaders duties
8698728 ive been focusing on tasman and then the crusaders but as of next week i will focus on both roles
8698729 its been in the back of a few minds theres no doubt about that
8698730 but when weve been together as a team the guys have really been focusing well on their rugby but theres always that underlying sense of anxiety
8698731 you just have to say to them what are you doing for next season and obviously theyre looking to their future it hasnt been easy for our guys and weve just had to focus on our rugby as much as we can and in some ways the rugby has been a really nice distraction
8698732 its been a busy time personally let alone having the distraction of coaching a side thats about to be exited at the end of the year
8698733 its been quite a challenge but all in all rugby is rugby and i absolutely love it and live for it
8698734 i think the set piece is massive and canterbury have got such a good set piece ive had a good look at their lineout and theyve absolutely dominated that area so far in the npc and thats going to be a real challenge for us
8698735 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8698736 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8698737 i felt so much for kerry and how wonderful a person she was
8698738 she did everything she could for people and loved animals and you couldnt have wished for a kinder more sincere person
8698739 its really fun a lot of kids enjoy it and my parents are really pleased
8698740 children these days have built up strength in video but reading was their weakness and i decided to use their strength to build up their weakness
8698741 results have revealed it to be the fastest reading improvement for children ever recorded in research
8698742 we had a huge response from families with kids saying they love going to school and cant be late because they will miss their reading class
8698743 more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8698744 joanna really trusts my driving and most of the time i trust hers
8698745 julia tem ajudado a criar designs bonitos e exclusivos para mulheres e homens o que ser um lembrete vis vel de que todos n s podemos participar da luta contra a aids na frica
8698746 adoro trabalhar com julia e agrade o mais uma vez o fato dela ficar sempre ao meu lado em colabora es importantes como esta
8698747 we are not controlling it and are not blockading it
8698748 battleships do not normally deliver aid and this is gunboat diplomacy it does not make the situation more stable
8698749 our role is to coordinate the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies that have been identified
8698750 the government of georgia has made a request for assistance when they do that the us government is always prepared to assist
8698751 people will support all efforts to increase security so that sort of attack does not repeat itself
8698752 to hide arms in boxes is an old russian fear
8698753 when georgia will receive arms it will receive them openly
8698754 we are thankful for america that they sent some help and europe
8698755 but we told them that we dont want those boxes of mres any more
8698756 i am glad to be back after a decade i really feel vindicated i feel great
8698757 second political tsunami the government is a titanic that will sink
8698758 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8698759 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8698760 we cannot afford to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall
8698761 the participants of the sco summit underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people for efforts aimed at the preservation under international law of the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8698762 support the active role of russia in assisting peace and cooperation in the region
8698763 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8698764 i hope it the sco statement will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white
8698765 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the united states deliberately created this conflict in order to worsen the situation and create an advantage for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8698766 hes involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there but that obviously state and local authorities have responsibilities
8698767 and by all accounts and purposes they are following through on those
8698768 these storms have a tendency to change and so i dont have a scheduling update for you now
8698769 we continue to remind gulf coast residents about the importance of taking precautionary measures to prepare for an emergency situation or evacuation before gustav approaches our shores
8698770 evangelizing all people in our modern world remains an essential church mission today
8698771 please describe what net neutrality is and your position on the issue
8698772 it does make you wonder this blog culture that grew up outside of the traditional media are we starting to step up to the stage and be with them as equals
8698773 evangelizing all people in our modern world remains an essential church mission today
8698774 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8698775 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8698776 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8698777 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8698778 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8698779 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8698780 we have some talented students working on it and we have a great swimming pool for testing
8698781 para cubrir la homosexualidad de newman y un modo de renegar su amor por otro hombre
8698782 vergonzosa traici n por parte de la odia gays iglesia cat lica
8698783 this crime is not typical for azerbaijani society it is not about azerbaijani mentality to solve conflicts by means of grenade explosions moreover at a mosque
8698784 forces that want to see chaos instability confrontation and fear in the south caucasus
8698785 their aim is the escalation of tension in azerbaijan and the confrontation of society along religious lines
8698786 it cannot be excluded that azerbaijans northern neighbor russia is involved in these events
8698787 on additional measures to reinforce security of the pipelines bridges power stations and main electricity lines in azerbaijan
8698788 evangelizing all people in our modern world remains an essential church mission today
8698789 i think its an important thing for the township and i hope the residents support it
8698790 im not going to say that we have this great crime spree going on but we have incidents that come up from time to time just to have our own deputies here we could greatly increase our response time and our follow up abilities on cases
8698791 holland saugatuck douglas allegan county and state police all pass in front of my house every day we do not need more police protection
8698792 if you had attended the meetings wherein there was a presentation on the cost of accidents and crime you would have been made aware of the data provided to support the need for additional preventative action
8698793 this year will be an election year and the turn out will likely be at 80 percent or more
8698794 right now they have a population of more than 5 000 if you looked at a city of 5 000 they would probably have a police department of at least 10
8698795 theres definitely a need they have a lot of stuff going on in laketown township
8698796 maybe this is a quirky reaction but the more i get to know barack obama the more he reminds me of chief justice john roberts their politics are very different of course perhaps 180 degrees apart but there is something about the two men that strikes me as similar
8698797 a company must go out and find what the customer wants the need is not for say half a million inch drill bits the needs is that there are ten million inch holes that need to be drilled
8698798 as long as the hurricane has louisiana in its sights this is where ill be were still hopeful that the storm will miss us but weve got to prepare as if its coming our way
8698799 we wanted to come up with something unique and different
8698800 to us mint means fresh green organic and mint condition its so many good things
8698801 our most popular item is the fancy tuna sandwich made with daves tuna
8698802 still a long way from oil and gas infrastructure but gas traders will be keenly focused on direction magnitude of this summers first storm to potentially impact energy markets
8698803 our state is better prepared that it has been before
8698804 i also want to remind people of their personal responsibility the time has come to get prepared dont wait until this friday when this storm is in the gulf
8698805 when we shipped internet explorer 7 we talked to communities around the world to understand what end users want
8698806 they say rome wasnt built in a day i wasnt on that job
8698807 incorrect parameters for super gives me a system incompatibility error media convert com online convertion so very slow free flv converter 1 3 very slow any video converter e simple mencoder shell gui create a speed up video with an audio not synchronized
8698808 like the vision of a laughing satan i get whenever my co worker bends down to pick up a pencil
8698809 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8698810 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8698811 for that reason everyone in gulf needs to be monitoring the storm at that point were expecting it to be a category 3 hurricane
8698812 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8698813 station owners have to value whats in their tanks based on what the replacement costs are whats it going to cost them to buy off the rack basically
8698814 so when that price goes up theyre going to start raising the price at the pump although its usually a short term thing
8698815 if alcohol containers refuse in excess of the alcohol limit is present residents of the suite may be held accountable for an alcohol violation
8698816 i think overall the event was a great success unfortunately the rain changed the dynamic of it but the overall purpose of the event was to allow people to interact with one another and that was definitely achieved
8698817 suddenly i heard this loud crash and this huge chunk of plaster fell onto my roommates bed
8698818 when the plaster got wet it started saturating and becoming very heavy and detaching from the wood lath across the ceiling once that all gets saturated the weight of that plaster was sitting on top of that sheetrock
8698819 since the room is so far gone lets take the opportunity to do the job right
8698820 the wall is leaking on the back side of the house and it looks like the shower drains are still leaking there was a repair to sheetrock in the toilet room that was never prepped and repainted
8698821 i dont know if i want to stay in another historic house if its going to fall like that
8698822 i dont believe the college is in any obligation to provide a weight room for their faculty
8698823 students really do expect that for paying a fair amount for their tuition and its an important part of students development
8698824 several student leaders that i talked to felt that the students did not believe they should be paying for faculty access
8698825 when all the students come to work out not all 10 000 students will be able to work out
8698826 east shore will never be able to meet the demands with the number of students going in there
8698827 we feel like were keeping you from doing something you really want to
8698828 my character sic are every womans dream their prince in shining armor thats what makes them so sexy
8698829 to provide the campus with coverage of news and events as well as comment on the social and educational level of the college community the organization holds itself to be independent from censorship in order to provide objective material to its readership the organization is also committed to providing students with an opportunity to learn and gain experience to carry on into the professional world
8698830 if we can run our offense and keep things fast and pass well ill be very happy and that will give us a good shot at winning
8698831 things that you usually look to juniors and seniors to do were looking more to our sophomores
8698832 im looking to those younger groups to accept responsibility faster than the older players
8698833 theres a lot of excitement and energy and its something weve talked about is controlling that excitement and getting ready to compete
8698834 really any setting where a split family gets together can be very awkward it requires new rules
8698835 it felt like in fairy tales were always the bad guys i didnt want to be the evil stepmother i wanted my own happily ever after
8698836 a code of behavior based on consideration kindness and unselfishness
8698837 in the end if its about the children you do the best you can because all of a sudden its not about you
8698838 a common misconception is that adventure travel is only for young people often its the unknown that can frighten people we have very experienced tour guides and well planned itineraries statistically speaking getting in your car and driving through manhattan is more dangerous than anything we do on our trips
8698839 international volunteering attracts a lot of different people from different places in their lives and with different perspectives on what theyre looking for people who love to travel but who want to do something different and be more than a tourist can benefit from international volunteering its a beautiful heart warming and inspiring experience
8698840 what we offer isnt tourism as in taking a traditional vacation we provide a real cultural immersion that allows participants to see into the daily lives of people in a community within one of the 12 countries we currently operate it
8698841 a typically day involves at least five hours of volunteering plus scheduled cultural activities language lessons group meals and free time to explore we believe that anyone who has a desire to volunteer can make a difference
8698842 a lot of the time people are feeling a loss of connection and love in their marriage so they kind of hold this fantasy that if they have a child that that will bring everything back to being okay part of its an idealization and the solution to fixing a problem
8698843 people dont stop and think about how even positive things in our lives bring in stress so if were already in a bad place in our relationship that will bring stresses and make our marriage more stressful
8698844 when marriages get kind of rocky people start casting about for reasons to stay together
8698845 sometimes for some reason its usually a woman and she thinks if she gets pregnant she can hang onto the husband because were having this baby together which is not a good reason to stay together or to have a child
8698846 one thing is that people whose marriage isnt working well tend to focus on their child and then the child gets brought into that lot slow down and at least get some advice from people who are sound
8698847 another reason is clearly the ability to communicate and resolve problems is important so bringing a child into the relationship so theres more instability that makes it harder to meet demands we set for each other
8698848 i do believe that many many marriages can be saved go to couples therapy find a therapist they can both relate to and try to work things out
8698849 leasing a vehicle is best for someone with good credit consistent driving habits that involves traveling relatively few miles and who has a financially stable lifestyle it can be extremely costly to end a lease early
8698850 once you accept a leased vehicle and have signed the leasing agreement youre committing to keep that exact vehicle and make all of the monthly payments associated with the lease
8698851 i can see all different kinds of circumstances why you might end up dating someone youve broken up with
8698852 i think what you can bring in to dating your next spouse is a new beginning taking in and bringing in new learning that you have about relationships because were different people every day and were changing and growing every day youre kind of bringing in your new self
8698853 thats a natural thing to come up to people its not an accident
8698854 what do you want to do is it an unresolved relationship have they worked on it before have they been to therapy has it not worked
8698855 if theyve done it all hey need to say this wont work lets not do this we have the kids and everything else if we want to try this we cant just have these little rendezvouses i guess id have to ask myself this how does it serve me to stay stuck why am i allowing myself to remain emotionally stuck instead allowing myself to stay here
8698856 a couple gets a divorce and has their reasons for doing that and after the divorce can decide for any number of reasons that they want to get back together again
8698857 that can be a good idea i suppose provided that theres been a real honest assessment of why they got divorced in the first place and how each of the parties contributed to that and how they contributed to the overall dysfunction in the marriage
8698858 for instance if he is moving into her home or she into his will there be contribution to bills how much on what basis if they are going to be renting a place together and there is a breakup is one partner going to be left with an expense that he she cant handle
8698859 may become adversaries and the fight is draining and expensive
8698860 the reality is that most people in living together relationships break up and the party holding the assets isnt eager to write a big check to someone he or she no longer loves and may no longer even like
8698861 this guy i really like has debts he doesnt want to get married and i am okay with living with him how do i protect my assets and stay independent of this guys debts so i am not financially responsible thank you in advance for any constructive advice
8698862 so if you do in fact have an affair its often a sign youre already on your way out the door
8698863 how many sexual partners have you had in the last year
8698864 that figure was pretty constant no matter what the age of the respondents so whether they were 27 33 or 44 about 4 5 percent of men and 2 5 percent of the women were annually defecting on their partners
8698865 when we asked married people have you ever had sex with someone other than your spouse during this marriage
8698866 they say i lived with him her for 10 years and it was all a lie
8698867 theyre very angry that they were misled violation of trust is a very very big story and its the destruction of trust that makes it so hard to restore the relationship
8698868 in the old days women had to look the other way because they were economically dependent on the men today they can pick up and move on therefore the expectation of a commitment is easier to enforce
8698869 many taxpayers are unaware of many of the available strategies they could deploy to save on their tax bill for instance it might make sense to defer a year end bonus or other income until 2008 if it works to your advantage
8698870 one to 1 2 million us residents are living with hiv infection or aids about a quarter of them do not know they have it about 75 percent of the 40 000 new infections each year are in men and about 25 percent in women about half of the new infections are in blacks even though they make up only 12 percent of the us population
8698871 dont think that love equals sex where you might jump into a physical relationship and construe that as love when its nothing more than a physical bond
8698872 the biggest thing i go over with women is when they chase somebody whos really not interested in them learning when someones interested in you and when somebodys not establishing boundaries learning not to parent the other person not looking for somebody to fix as a project
8698873 increasing numbers of chlamydia infections have made it the most widespread std in the usa
8698874 i tell most of my clients to start dating themselves until theyre ready to move onward
8698875 it was safety and i couldnt forgive myself if something happened to my kids
8698876 for several years i didnt realize how bad it was and it was getting progressively worse
8698877 if mankind is to survive we will need new ways of doing things if you keep doing what youve always done youll keep getting what you always got
8698878 take stock and ask yourself how did i contribute to the problem was i too na ve did i step over red flags did i allow something i was uncomfortable with are there things in the way i make decisions that i need to take a look at
8698879 our trust in another individual can be grounded in our evaluation of his or her ability integrity and benevolence the more we observe these characteristics in another person the more our level of trust is likely to grow
8698880 every time you neglect to take a stand or protect your time and energy you send a message to yourself that you cant be trusted
8698881 the worst thing an attorney can experience is to go to a hearing or trial and for the first time learn negative information about a client
8698882 i think its very important to let your attorney know everything about that marriage the client needs to feel comfortable raising any questions and sharing any information they have the client needs to be willing to share any bad news about him or herself with their attorney
8698883 for me the decision to get a divorce was tough but i had know idea just how tough it was going to be
8698884 a divorce process can be highly stressful it can be very hard on ones life a client may need to consider some counseling to help them deal with the stress which will depend in part on how contested the divorce is and how hostile the other party is
8698885 my psychiatrist helped out a lot she was there to listen and that was nice i remember she kept telling me over and over again that what i was going through was difficult and that i needed to realize just how difficult it was
8698886 the legal process can be very slow depending on the number and complexity of the issues that are in the case and its not at all atypical to have a divorce last six to 12 months and sometimes longer
8698887 always understand what your attorney is doing and make sure the attorney is explaining everything to your satisfaction
8698888 the attorneys attitude should be if there is anything you dont understand or agree with lets talk about it
8698889 once i felt comfortable asking my lawyer questions about the divorce process my mind was put at ease knowing why we were doing what we did helped a lot
8698890 they asked questions like what is the square footage of your apartment
8698891 that made me feel a lot better about the whole deal it didnt feel like an outright attack on my personal life
8698892 i had been married at that point for 11 years to a man i adored who had never given me one reason ever to doubt his sincerity or to not to trust him so this was an aberration in my husbands life
8698893 how am i going to throw something so valuable away because he made a stupid mistake
8698894 although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him
8698895 ive seen very cultured gentle people who never curse completely break down and do a lot of screaming and swearing
8698896 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8698897 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8698898 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8698899 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8698900 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8698901 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8698902 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8698903 is thought to be one big reason why macs have boosted their share of the u s personal computer market to nearly 8 percent
8698904 the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative
8698905 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to suspend all zoom operations it is a tragic day for our passengers and staff
8698906 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8698907 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying
8698908 we prepare for the worst but hope for the best
8698909 to be part of history like this is just amazing its unbelievable
8698910 as you gain more real word experience you gain wisdom
8698911 and with wisdom you can apply that to your relationship
8698912 couples can look at compatibility problem solving how to navigate the relationship
8698913 it means that some of the benefits that exist out there for couples to be successful there are support systems to encourage that
8698914 so you being to look at things a little bit different
8698915 that wisdom that comes with life experience gets played out in choosing a partner
8698916 the educated classes take longer to finish their education and therefore feel socially and financially ready to marry
8698917 for alimony to be deductible the payer and the recipient of alimony cannot file a joint return
8698918 which parent receives the benefit of the tax exemption for a dependent child is also subject to irs regulations
8698919 neither can file as head of household because the dependent child resides with neither parent for more than 50 percent of the year
8698920 in general employed custodial parents of a dependent child under the age of 13 are eligible for the credit for child care expenses incurred so that the parent can earn an income
8698921 as the custodial parents income increases however the credit phases out
8698922 there are people who have always been unsatisfied with their appearance these people have rhinoplasties nasal surgery for large noses chin implants for small chins and ear setbacks for protruding ears
8698923 and then there are those people who were happy with their appearance when they were young but are disturbed by the changes of aging these people might have facelifts or eyelid lifts and also abdominoplasties tummy tucks and breast lifts
8698924 plastic surgery among men is getting more and more popular its become more acceptable for men to be concerned about appearance
8698925 i moved to tulsa and got a lower paying job just to see my son more everything was going all right until two months ago when she decided to move to oklahoma city now i have to take her back to court to try and get custody
8698926 by oklahoma law she is suppose to petition the court before she moves with him however when she moved to tulsa she failed to file anything a point we brought up during our last ordeal in court but the judge simply offered a warning and no consequences for moving
8698927 the mother of my son has literally done everything within her ability to keep me from getting
8698928 i have been tempted to just leave this whole situation simply because at times its just so frustrating and i know the impact it will inevitably have on my son
8698929 when he is older he will want to know where i was and i will have to explain to him that a guy he never met when he was very young argued by two people who had no interest in his life decided how much i could see him the police department cant help my lawyer gets tired of my phone calls and in the end im out 6 000 and still cant see him anymore than 4 days a month
8698930 healing you healing me a divorce group leaders guide and getting up getting over getting on a twelve step guide to divorce recovery
8698931 i think that knowing first of all that you are not alone in this it is a very important piece of information
8698932 to share ones story but also to hear other people in the group share their stories helps people to understand that divorce is normal today it is not strange or unheard of
8698933 people wont be afraid they will be attacked or embarrassed people can take their time or not at all
8698934 in other words i can say whats on my mind and no one is going to say no youre wrong
8698935 someone will be really upset and choked up about something and the natural instinct is for people to comfort someone
8698936 then people jump on bandwagon with advice it becomes overwhelming we discourage that
8698937 we just let the person be in the moment and that in itself can be really healing
8698938 a handbook of divorce and custody forensic developmental and clinical perspectives
8698939 divorce is high on the richter scale there it is probably the second most stressful thing one goes through
8698940 talking to people helps answer those questions and keep things in perspective
8698941 unlike previous generations who turned to family for dating guidance online daters dont have the benefit of getting advice from parents and grandparents about how to handle situations like when to take down your profile
8698942 it says im interested in you and i dont want to date anyone else
8698943 studied more than 10 000 families in the to study the links between family structure non resident fathers and kids eating habits
8698944 one of the best moves a single dad can make is to let the kids help with the cooking
8698945 once you get them involved you can show them how to serve carrot sticks and raw broccoli with low fat ranch dressing to dip in or nibble on before dinner or make spaghetti squash by having your kids use forks to pull off the strands of the squash so they look like spaghetti
8698946 make them scrambled eggs a hardboiled eggs low fat cheese or yogurt
8698947 it will keep them filled up until lunch time studies show that kids who eat breakfast do better in school
8698948 when you go make a list and stick to it
8698949 dr susans kids only weight loss guide the parents action guide to success
8698950 take the list with your planned in advance treats like a box of cookies or a box of reasonably healthy cereal and draw the snack line right there
8698951 dont give in to tantrums in the candy cookie and cereal aisles
8698952 on the other hand dont go overboard pushing only super healthy foods you have to find the right balance
8698953 soda is the biggest culprit of overweight over sugared kids
8698954 i think they would say weird because at one time i can be very witty other times my humor is caustic and still other times its rather predictable
8698955 it can bring about an atmospheric change in the boardroom as quickly as it can create a breathing space between quarreling spouses or playground rivals i believe that god has a beautiful sense of humor and has graced us with a portion of it to use as a tool of communication common to all humans because of its equalizing properties i have put it to good use with difficult customers difficult students and their parents as well as being able to keep myself uplifted and positive
8698956 even though im now financially secure i worry about money constantly and flinch at paying full price for anything
8698957 the higher the educational and occupational level the higher the income and the less likely you are to divorce
8698958 kids who drop out of high school and get married very quickly suffer from the strains of not being emotionally mature and not having the income to help weather the difficulties of marriage
8698959 marriage is more difficult today than it was in the past
8698960 couples who excel in one area probably excel in others areas too and people who are high school dropouts probably have a higher propensity to drop out of marriage
8698961 the way we used to look at marriage was that if women were highly educated they had higher earning power they were more culturally liberal and people might have predicted less marriage among them
8698962 whats becoming more powerful is the idea that economic resources are conducive to stable marriages women who have more money or the potential for more money are married to men who have more stable income
8698963 usually i try not to let something like that bother my job performance but i thought about it all the time
8698964 any time youre under stress at home it puts you under stress at work
8698965 people might have difficulty concentrating they might have fluctuating moods or they might be more fragile emotionally
8698966 real close friends some people who were going through the same situation or have gone through the same situation
8698967 the main thing is to make sure youre taking care of yourself eating right sleeping right you have to get your sleep or youll be stressed make sure that youre exercising regular and doing stress reducers like meditation
8698968 if you arent getting enough sleep the right way you can ask for a prescription for sleep medications also try to reduce issues as effectively as possible with your spouse and whether thats seeing a counselor or going to an attorney to resolve your differences
8698969 i worked at the same job for a long time until it went out of business
8698970 i always worked my hardest it stress from the divorce didnt get to me
8698971 emotionally he got me right at the right time i was very excited about shedding a 195 pound problem
8698972 people want to do something it might be the wrong thing but they want to do something
8698973 they just want to feel like theyre making progress emotionally they need to do something
8698974 i was scared i didnt have a ton of money and i didnt know how i was going to pay for an attorney i didnt even know how much an attorney was going to cost me the whole process was just devastating
8698975 i didnt know where i was going to get the money but it seemed like the best option at the time
8698976 if the parties are willing to negotiate compromise and agree the costs can be reasonable if they decide to litigate the costs can be considerable
8698977 keep emotions in check and work toward a respectful settlement to avoid litigation
8698978 i just wanted to get it over with and thats not how i should have gone about it
8698979 the truth is i lost out my daughter lost out all because i was scared of those legal fees
8698980 why did i marry you anyway overcoming the myths that hinder a happy marriage
8698981 three big issues money sex and kids these are the top issues couples fight about
8698982 most people dont want to think less of themselves and want to believe that they are doing their best
8698983 when i got married a part of me was relieved because it meant my days of playing the dating game were over but then it ends and youre thrust back into it
8698984 its like moving to a foreign country and not speaking the language
8698985 at first youre still reacting to whats happened often people at this stage do short term relationships with little future and this is a kind of safety for them
8698986 a person should ask themselves how afraid am i of being alone if the answer is very then thats a sign youre not able to develop standards and are just reacting
8698987 i think generally just the fact that if there are many generations between you and your spouse one theres a lack of commonality and experience
8698988 you refer to things that your partner doesnt understand thats part of the experience problem you dont share things together
8698989 for example one person might bring up the beatles and the other person might not understand because they didnt live through that
8698990 what happens is when you have people who are at different developmental states in their lives they have different needs
8698991 you have to decide if youre going to introduce your children or have children together one person might have already gone through that
8698992 if hes older his level of parental adequacy can be limited because hes maybe raised his own children or he is invested in other areas of his life because hes with friends or his rigidness to participate in raising children who are much younger
8698993 people might have different sexual appetites and power struggles thats problems with age experience again
8698994 men who are older may have established themselves financially so thats going to present some challenges to working out differences between who takes responsibility of the checkbook who pays the bills those are always issues of power in a relationship
8698995 one of the most immediate things is to get a good handle on your assets your income and your expenses
8698996 its easy to figure out income whats a little more difficult to figure out are expenses you have to understand youre not going to have the same lifestyle as prior to the divorce and things are going to keep changing what may make sense today might change drastically over time so keep meticulous track of your expenses
8698997 rushing is one of the worst things you can do
8698998 oftentimes rushing means making decisions one at a time when actually you shouldnt make isolated decisions when it comes to your finances there are so many intertwined areas it makes more sense to take your time and then take action all at once
8698999 you really need to trust your advisor so interview several before making a decision to go with one
8699000 he got away with a lot of things he wouldnt have if i didnt know astrology
8699001 these include both close intimate relationships and also open enemies which is what two people in a divorce often become
8699002 if youre in one and its not working youre miserable if you dont have one and you want one youre miserable
8699003 i think you would find if you talked to most astrologers relationships are probably the number one issue that we talk about
8699004 most of the clients i see have relationship or break up issues
8699005 it helps to know that youre coming into hard times
8699006 most people think their problems are going to last forever but theyre not
8699007 your chart will tell you what you need from a relationship what lessons youve learned from that other person
8699008 if you know a little bit more about how you love why you love what value you place on love then you can respect share and tolerate your partners perhaps very different values surrounding love
8699009 i dont think the chart can say oh this persons going to divorce
8699010 but the chart can reveal factors about the potential for break ups and bad relationships there are many signs and pointers to the individuals ability to sustain a commitment and the kind of partnerships they need
8699011 youve got to meet my friend hes brilliant gorgeous and tons of fun
8699012 the novelty of being with someone will turn on anyone
8699013 there are many ways to escape a family making a lifelong commitment with someone who isnt a worthy partner isnt the best choice
8699014 why did i marry you anyway overcoming the myths that hinder a happy marriage
8699015 infatuation is instantaneous and some experts suggest can be hormonal
8699016 when the zing is gone they assume they married the wrong person and go looking again
8699017 we are desperately sorry for the inconvenience that this will cause passengers and those who have booked flights
8699018 even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying

8699033 while we are constantly evaluating investment opportunities in the local media sector and continue to have a very strong pipeline of future opportunities we did not see the grand island operation as a good strategic or geographic fit and felt we could redeploy the capital more effectively elsewhere i am delighted to announce the sale of these publications to the omaha world herald company which has a significant and venerable presence in nebraska
8699034 yes it was a lot higher than people expected but conditions are dramatically different now than they were in the second quarter

8699071 i think its pretty remarkable that i get to see people that are below 9 showing up at our festival and then people in their 50s showing up at our festival and they all seem to appreciate and enjoy the music across the board
8699072 i think our partners have always pretty much stood by the fact that were a family festival
8699073 obviously lollapalooza for the last four years hasnt been like lollapalooza of the early 90s
8699074 we are a company of 25 38 as well and we know what we were going to want to go do if we were going to pay the money turns out thats who come to our festivals too
8699075 but we always keep in mind that its getting a little older and thats very interesting especially for lollapalooza
8699076 theres certainly some thought that goes into how do we make the event as broad as possible
8699077 we really wanted to have a whole stage to dedicate to that genre of music to appeal to a little bit of an older audience
8699078 in some cases theres actually three generations that are out there

8699329 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8699330 we were surprised to find that long in fly time before a fly takes off in response to a predator or swatter it plans the direction of the jump by making a rather complex series of postural movements
8699331 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8699332 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting
8699333 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8699334 in the new paper i show that time reversal followed immediately by conventional reflection from a mirror has the same effect as negative refraction
8699335 although my paper is purely theoretical in content it does give a practical road map for realisation of the concept by exploiting and developing existing technology we can make negative refraction a practical proposition
8699336 if follow up research suggested that dissemination of normal breast cells can account for metastatic relapse in breast cancer patients a hypothetical situation at present we would argue that treatment strategies should aim to compromise viability and or proliferation of normal breast cells and not just breast tumour cells
8699337 in anticipation of gustav reaching hurricane strength today wx4nhc the amateur radio station at the national hurricane center in miami will be activating today at 12 pm edt 1600z
8699338 if you are in the affected area and normally monitor on a local net on vhf 40 or 80 meters we would appreciate your checking into the hwn net or echolink irlp net once per hour to receive the latest hurricane advisories and to report your local conditions
8699339 please do not venture outside during the hurricane to gather weather data
8699340 there are a few echolink and irlp nodes in the affected area of jamaica and we hope that amateur radio operators with these capabilities in neighboring caribbean islands and the international radio emergency support coalition iresc can support us with contacts in the affected area via hf and other means as well as direct contact via echolink and irlp all information will be helpful for wx4nhc the amateur radio station at the national hurricane center
8699341 the department of homeland securitys federal emergency management agency fema is coordinating plans and preparatory activities of numerous federal agencies in close communication with state tribal and local officials as tropical storm gustav threatens to return to hurricane strength prior to impacting gulf coast states
8699342 fema and its federal partners are in close communications with states along its potential path in order to review plans pre station assets and personnel and respond to any request for assistance femas work with states using a gap analysis tool to determine in advance of storms where federal assistance is most likely to be needed has helped federal and state agencies to develop pre scripted mission assignments and other contingency plans to help improve response and recovery efforts

8699345 the channel senses the pressure inside the bacteria as a result the channel alters its shape and creates an opening releasing the pressure the motion is just like that of a camera iris and being able to see this motion is an amazing discovery
8699346 not only is this a major step forward in scientific understanding of a fundamental process in biology but it paves the way for the development of new drugs against bacteria
8699347 new chemicals designed to forcing channels to stay open or shut are likely to kill or at the very least greatly slow down the growth of bacteria
8699348 for the average child who went to a particularly effective or high quality preschool their maths scores would be boosted by around 27 per cent
8699349 the effects of the early home learning environment were very strong much stronger than people had anticipated
8699350 an ideal home learning environment would be rich in stimulation and very responsive to the childs communications and activities
8699351 parents would talk to their children frequently read to them maybe visit library to increase range of books for child provide opportunities to draw paint learn songs and rhymes dance and physical activities play with numbers and shapes the important thing is that the home provides lots of learning opportunities the fact that learning is taking place is more important than the actual content of the learning this provides the child with the mental structures needed to learn new things
8699352 this detailed data allows us to examine the effects of various factors while allowing for the differences in the other factors and backgrounds of children
8699353 our study is the first to show that preschool shows advantages across the whole population while being able to allow for other confounding factors
8699354 preschool particularly high quality preschool boosts childrens development in several ways when children start school and these early effects persist particularly for the children who went to high quality preschools in addition good quality teaching in primary school also matters
8699355 so a child who has a good home learning environment good preschool and good primary school will do better than a child with only two who will do better than a child who has one who will do better than a child who has none of these
8699356 the difference between a childs development with all three compared to none is very great
8699357 a play based curriculum that offers lots of learning opportunities that cover reading and play with numbers and shapes and some time in individual one to one activities as well as small group work

8699363 back in 1962 hed been the first british rider ever to wear the race leaders yellow jersey
8699364 various factors led to simpsons death on july 13 1967 the heat the mountains the lack of support he was riding with a weak national team the pressure on a rider nearing thirty to win the tour before his time passed but the prime cause of simpsons heart attack on mont ventoux was his use of methamphetamines which helped his body ignore sense and make his last words a dying pley to be put back on his bike
8699365 youd have to be an imbecile or hypocrite to imagine that a professional cyclist who rides 235 days a year can hold himself together without stimulants
8699366 these changes will affect any federal project that affects any endangered species
8699367 if these changes had come into place fema would have been able to make that decision
8699368 to ensure that decisions arent being made for political reasons
8699369 what were looking to do is remove some of the bureaucratic red tape on common sense projects
8699370 what this doesnt do is offer a federal agency a sort of get out of jail free card
8699371 they have an expertise that is unrivaled by any other agency

8699434 banks the traditional leader in payment systems see mobile banking as a new threat if private telecom operators are allowed to use their outlets for money transfer without law
8699435 we wont let anything which hurts the banking industry happen
8699436 we have given our opinions at the meeting and told the central bank that banks have no objection to using modern technology as a tool of expanding delivery channels
8699437 i think well have a pretty good year in 2008 it looks to me that well grow about 15
8699438 its hard to really look beyond 2008 but 2009 shouldnt be any different
8699439 sagicor really emerged from a caribbean base and is seeking to grow beyond the caribbean into the us and the uk in particular
8699440 the caribbean remains an integral part of their base that allows a kind of springboard to expand and acquire business in first world countries
8699441 within the caribbean jamaica is a significant part of sagicor in terms of revenues and assets under management jamaica until the end of last year was about 30 to 35 of sagicor as they expand that proportion will sink and sink but its not going to shrink because the jamaica operations are shrinking its because theyre expanding more rapidly elsewhere
8699442 what the merger will do for us is give us economies of scale to deliver a product that is even more cost effective than what we do now so there are ways in which the customer will win out of this transaction
8699443 im sure that sentiment is out there but its not a business where there are any big barriers to entry
8699444 for example guardian life entered the market about three years ago and took quite a market share they have about 25 now so a brand new player came into the market and found they could carve out a piece for themselves
8699445 the blue cross brand is not something we are buying so that brand becomes available about 18 months after the transaction is complete if somebody wants to enter the market and use that same brand they are free to do so
8699446 that is largely because loj is a very institutionalized name in jamaica
8699447 it has a pretty rich background but we felt that our effort to contribute to the groups international brand building should make jamaican clients feel theyre not just clients of a strong jamaican company but ultimately clients of an international company
8699448 its a strange thing id say people over the age of lets say 50 who have known loj over these many years are the ones with some reservations the brand that they knew is gone people of 20 30 40 years old they have not had that association with loj so its not so important to them
8699449 it was in recognition of the rebranding and name change to sagicor i dont think they the parent company have any expectation of necessarily raising capital here

8699471 this car wash system is usually done in summer in the united states and canada a fund is generally raised in the name of a school sport association or for charity purposes the pretty school girls in bikinis call by the donors at the roadside with colorful cardboard signs and the cars are then washed by their male and female classmates at a nearby place

8699509 even if someone has to cart me into the car on sunday and ive done all i can i can be pleased and proud of myself
8699510 they are going to be fantastic games the rivalry is there between england we played against them a couple of years ago and got a victory it promises to be a great atmosphere in both games
8699511 our home form is very good its just our away form that has been very poor if we can get that right it will go a long way to getting through to the next round
8699512 we dont have to travel far and the fixtures have fallen nicely weve got a home game against villarreal inbetween the games against liverpool and chelsea
8699513 i remember the last game at celtic distinctly they beat us to qualify and the atmosphere from their fans was unbelievable they will be two huge games

8699522 one of the issues for arsene is the distances we have to travel they are long trips and he prefers more local matches so we get back a little sooner
8699523 the important thing is making a good start we took one point from the first three games last season and weve got to do better
8699524 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8699525 we know it wont be easy but we know liverpool from p laying them last year that could be an advantage for us but also for them
8699526 romanian football has come on a lot and fiorentina were semi finalists in last seasons uefa cup and had a good season in italy well have to get points pretty much everywhere

8699588 possessing a desire to understand the universe an intp is constantly looking for natural law curiosity concerning these keys to the universe is a driving force in this type for intps the world exists primarily to be understood reality is trivial a mere arena for proving ideas it is essential that the universe is understood and that whatever is stated about the universe is stated correctly with coherence and without redundancy this is the intps final purpose
8699589 intps are known for their quest for logical purity which motivates them to examine universal truths and principles
8699590 intps have a special gift with generating and analyzing theories and possibilities to prove or disprove them
8699591 people with the intp personality type are global thinkers they see everything as one giant entity that is connected and seek knowledge about that entity they constantly seek the truth and have ultimate respect for the truth it is not easy for the intp to reach a conclusion about the truth their auxiliary function of extraverted intuition allows them to absorb the many complexities in our world and they are driven to consider each of these complexities before reaching a conclusion once they have reached a conclusion or discovered a truth they are very particular about the way that truth is expressed and understood they want to know that the principles of their understanding have been understood correctly and demand absolute precision and correctness from others when describing these principles they also apply these standards to themselves when communicating their knowledge if they take the time to develop their communication so that it meets their own approval they can be extremely good educational writers
8699592 intps live in the world of theoretical possibilities they see everything in terms of how it could be improved or what it could be turned into they live primarily inside their own minds having the ability to analyze difficult problems identify patterns and come up with logical explanations they seek clarity in everything and are therefore driven to build knowledge their natural drive to turn theories into concrete understanding may turn into a feeling of personal responsibility to solve theoretical problems and help society move towards a higher understanding
8699593 da kommen jede menge spieler die unglaublich viel erreicht haben mit denen in einer mannschaft zu sein oder gegen die zu spielen das macht schon stolz
8699594 but god can you be a mother when your babys not with you

8699611 cuando se desagregan los factores que determinan ese incremento nos encontramos con una realidad en el ndice nacional de precios al consumidor los alimentos representan por encima de 30 del conjunto de factores
8699612 en 1989 lleg a 81 en 1996 lleg a 103 desde 1998 hasta 2001 se redujo significativamente vinieron los conflictos del golpe de estado y el paro petrolero que influyeron en la inflaci n de 2002 luego se fue moderando y ahora viene subiendo
8699613 la econom a venezolana es estructuralmente inflacionaria por qu el ingreso nacional supera varias veces la productividad como consecuencia de esto la capacidad de compra supera tambi n varias veces la producci n nacional eso obedece hist ricamente a que desde 1934 se produjo una fuerte revaluaci n del bol var cuando en el mundo se devaluaban todas las monedas comenzando por el d lar lo cual impact fuertemente la producci n agroalimentaria del pa s
8699614 con la apertura de los puertos de los mercados venezolanos a la importaci n indiscriminada de productos alimentarios fue demoledor para el sector de producci n de alimentos en venezuela
8699615 para este a o tendremos completamente satisfecha la demanda de arroz e incluso con algunos excedentes que permitir n acumular ciertos stocks igualmente la producci n de ma z blanco y amarillo as como otros rubros tienden tambi n a incrementarse como el de la leche
8699616 el sector manufacturero est por encima de 4 con tendencia a nuevos incrementos e incluso recibiendo nuevos impulsos como la creaci n del fondo para el financiamiento de nuevas empresas y ampliaci n de empresas que fue presentado el pasado martes por el ministro de planificaci n y el milco ministerio de industrias ligeras y comercio

8699619 ser n desmantelados los monopolios y petr leos de venezuela pdvsa garantizar al pueblo venezolano el consumo de combustible l quido de manera m s eficaz eficiente y segura todo lo cual obedece tambi n a razones de seguridad y defensa de la naci n
8699620 esta es una ley revolucionaria la asamblea nacional en correspondencia con el mandato de la constituci n de 1999 est aprobando leyes a la justa medida del pueblo que antes estaba excluido y ahora lo beneficia
8699621 que juegan al retardo y al retraso lo que traj como consecuencia que en nuestras fronteras se permitiera el contrabando de extracci n de gasolina

8699628 wir bekommen unterst tzung von menschen die uns gar nicht kennen vielen dank daf r
8699629 you were blaming sara if darnell goes you kept on going on in your usual way grinding her down harping on about it
8699630 you dont want anyone to like me because youre a jealous little man you cant take the fact that people like me that makes you a very pathetic man and i feel sorry for you honestly you should think about the things you say
8699631 you dont realise youre a control freak and bullying everybody
8699632 rex will never accept any responsibility hes a classic bully
8699633 id prefer it if you didnt talk to me or mention my name if thats how youre going on its pathetic
8699634 why do you think ive nominated you six times rex
8699635 varick media management is the first digital media management company that allows media trading in real time across all online exchanges ad networks and websites similar to hedge funds we also use proprietary algorithms to manage our clients investments and deliver the best roi our algorithms enable us to aggregate audiences and optimize the media mix
8699636 we are pleased to register continued growth in revenues for the group from albeit a modest start to first quarter revenues of some 30 000 we now report quarter two revenues of 69 045
8699637 thats like sending erik paulsen to washington and after two years saying hes ready to be president
8699638 to me the cottage is home family memories deep relaxation and great fun and the loons that wake me in the morning arent tory mps
8699639 you are asking me to support you and risk something what are you risking shouldnt you have something valuable on the line
8699640 if security sweeps are the giveaway former massachusetts gov mitt romney may be on the brink of being selected as sen john mccains r ariz vice presidential running mate
8699641 this could be richmond in just a few years theyve figured out a lot of things here that we could do with the right investments and planning look at this
8699642 ive fought and won contested primaries and elections ive served in both the majority and the minority of both the house and the senate i have over 50 000 recorded votes and i know how to get things done
8699643 ill do anything and everything i can for obama im proud to serve as a surrogate but ill spend most of this political year stumping with mark warner and our other great congressional candidates the only race that cant be won is the one you dont run we have great candidates across virginia and its clear that we could pick up three to five seats
8699644 well pick all of this up only after we elect barack obama and mark warner but if you ask who my opponent is for 2009 ill tell you its bob mcdonnell
8699645 none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines
8699646 i know lots of people hate hinder and im fine with that
8699647 it doesnt matter our fans matter and they know we work hard and put on a great show
8699648 i think it is brilliant i welcome it for west bromwich
8699649 this is still at an early stage and the indication is that they will be submitting more plans in the future
8699650 i know there may be more to come but i think the ring and ride and the space for taxis is very important it is what people have always argued for and i think we need to make that clear to tesco
8699651 in a strange coincidence to earths last eden good vs evil emerges as a major theme this season i think the audience will quickly identify with one group or the other
8699652 ho ancora la forza di starvi a racconare di tutti quegli sbagli che per un motivo o laltro so rifare
8699653 ma se io avessi previsto tutto questo dati cause e pretesto di attuali conclusioni
8699654 has offended the religious feelings of many people who consider the cross a symbol of gods love and of our redemption
8699655 pokes fun at the catholic population and offends religion and the pope
8699656 with humor and a tragicomic sense which belongs to art since the times of greek tragedy kippenberger faces his condition of suffering which he expresses in many works also for example in a video in which he crucifies himself
8699657 if no more survivors are found this would be one of the deadliest losses at sea involving people trying to reach europe from

8699659 he is terrified by the prospect of going to america
8699660 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8699661 the department doesnt comment on matters of extradition unless and until an individual is extradited and on u s soil
8699662 democrats traditionally consider our hard earned tax money forcibly extracted from our pay checks their money
8699663 we the people get the government we vote for in massachusetts they gave us one party rule of law out of fear of vindictive democrat legislators should the people rise up and attempt an override those same legislators will ignore it anyway as they have other important initiatives
8699664 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some dj and now shes writing a book lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
8699665 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse sam is using my daughter my daughter isnt working because shes always with sam even my ex wife dina knows it she just isnt doing anything about it
8699666 hes out of control i want him to stop hurting and talking to the media about the people i love
8699667 job seekers in some fields are competing aggressively for open positions giving employers the edge in those segments of the hiring market at the same time however companies continue to face a shortage of highly skilled professionals in fields such as technology and accounting these in demand workers may not be willing to leave secure positions unless firms extend very attractive job offers
8699668 i think this convention provided an opportunity for the american citizens to see not only what our party is about but what barack obama and his familys like
8699669 there was a lot of emphasis on who the candidate is where he came from his background his family and particularly with michelle obama
8699670 i think we are going to pick up a substantial number of seats
8699671 all over the country we have candidates who have outraised either incumbents or republican challengers and who are doing very well in the polls
8699672 very very few of our candidates are under severe challenge so i think were going to pick up a good number of seats expand our majority in the united states house of representatives and expand our majority in the united states senate
8699673 jack and roy are both respected public servants and eastern shore leaders and im honored to have their support in this race
8699674 this race isnt about party labels it is about bringing change to washington so we can finally start addressing the challenges we face fixing our energy policy cutting wasteful spending cracking down on illegal immigration and protecting the bay will require leaders who can work across party lines to get real results
8699675 but but theres a big but here we cannot have motion commotion emotion and no results
8699676 thank you for doing what is in your heart for coming home this is your home
8699677 the us is a great country the uk is a great country but this is your country
8699678 i believe israel is a place where all jews should live
8699679 but my decision is for both zionist and religious reasons and because i love the country its an intellectual reasoning to an emotional desire
8699680 i feel like im finally where im meant to be
8699681 its a new form of aliyah adapting to the 21st century
8699682 most of the jews are no longer behind iron curtains or in areas of political persecution or poverty they are in well to do countries like the uk and they are not running away from anything they are simply coming home
8699683 i felt an extra pull because of the media coverage
8699684 in the uk i became very used to the idea that jews often have that they have to keep their heads down or they have to keep quiet and not respond to criticisms of israel so to be part of a huge body that actually welcomes you because youre jewish is very stimulating i wanted to go back to the army ideologically i feel part of something in israel rather than being on the outskirts
8699685 but at nefesh our model is to focus on the absorption we help olim to bridge the gap between the ideals the vision the dream and the every day practicalities finding jobs good homes education social networks and support
8699686 when they arrive the work of nefesh is only just beginning and once they are absorbed well not only do they stay but they also send back to their friends and families and communities the message that its a great place come over
8699687 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
8699688 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
8699689 the device sounds absolutely amazing we have been raising money for supplies for wounded israeli soldiers for more than 30 years and we used to give a lot of money to the sheba medical centre for that kind of equipment
8699690 since tests havent begun yet we dont know what the ailment is
8699691 he comes every six months for a routine checkup around a month ago a checkup was conducted and he was in perfect health
8699692 mladic may have had a plastic surgery but he is not hiding like karadzic
8699693 he not only changed his image but also the way he walked and talked
8699694 but when he cut his hair and the beard he started walking quickly like old karadzic that was the disguise
8699695 karadzic likes public appearances in the hague hell be like a fish in the water like milosevic
8699696 in a climate where it is increasingly difficult to shine commercial bank amp trust co proves it can be done
8699697 in fact local residents should be proud that their bank is one of the elite financial institutions in the nation
8699698 our business frankly was to demonstrate that we could work together we have some healing to do
8699699 were not always going to agree on everything we may not always agree to the point that we may want
8699700 so were not reliant totally on our own marketing resources to do that
8699701 over time the subscriber growth will be much more a function of cable and international distribution deals
8699702 this study adds to our evidence that social interactions are important for health and well being
8699703 interestingly we found that social integration may be particularly important for individuals with low levels of education fewer than 12 years of school completed
8699704 elderly with low levels of education experienced on average more rapid decline in memory but also a suggestion of a greater benefit due to social integration
8699705 when you get to be this age a lot of people need social interaction which stimulates your brain
8699706 it also improves your physical fitness skills since your brain tells your body what to do its all tied in together

8699729 nectar which was thought to be natures soft drink may not be so soft after all
8699730 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8699731 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8699732 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8699733 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8699734 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8699735 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8699736 visually mediated motor planning in the escape response of drosophila
8699737 improving crystal quality and purity leads to explosive materials that are safer less likely to react violently when subjected to mechanical impact or heat
8699738 the design of custom solvents through first principles modeling opens up new possibilities for the dissolution of materials that are hard to dissolve
8699739 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8699740 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8699741 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8699742 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8699743 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8699744 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8699745 our ultimate goal is to develop interventions that we can apply after a traumatic brain injury to improve outcomes and reduce the long term risk of alzheimers
8699746 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8699747 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8699748 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8699749 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure
8699750 the c f bond is difficult to transform into other bonds under mild conditions because it is inert and unreactive its a challenge to chemists
8699751 but we found a way to take a c f bond that you can do very little with and break it and convert it cleanly into something else at room temperature
8699752 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8699753 our discovery that t costata was already on a trajectory of decline prior to this period corroborates this hypothesis by providing the first circumstantial evidence that humans were not only using but also depleting reef resources making t costata the likely earliest victim of anthropogenic degradation of coral reefs
8699754 declining marine and terrestrial resources by human and climatic factors respectively may have acted in concert to thwart the precocious but short lived colonization of the near east by anatomically modern but technologically primitive humans at the end of the last interglacial
8699755 we were surprised to find that long in fly time before a fly takes off in response to a predator or swatter it plans the direction of the jump by making a rather complex series of postural movements
8699756 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8699757 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response

8699759 these instruments have done for the time domain what the electron microscope did for space
8699760 as these instruments become more common i think we will see that animals perform many behaviors on rapid time scales that simply evaded the detection of our sluggish eyes
8699761 i have a lot of respect for paris hilton shes ballsy shes learned to play with the paparazzi attention and have fun with it and she creates little mysteries in the tabloid arena i have fun with her but its always been platonic our relationship wasnt sexual though i understand that sex sells

8699763 we hope to develop these techniques further and apply them to more volcanoes worldwide
8699764 potentially these techniques could extend our knowledge of volcanic recharge considerably as they can be applied to material erupted before volcanic monitoring was commonplace
8699765 we hope that what we find in the crystals in terms of timescales can be linked with phenomena such as earthquakes
8699766 if we can relate the timescales we measure to such events we may be able to say when we could expect a volcano to erupt
8699767 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8699768 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8699769 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests

8699783 israelis of all generations will be excited at the prospect of celebrating our 60th anniversary with such a musical and cultural legend
8699784 the beatles have always enjoyed huge popular support in israel reaching out across boundaries of generation background and faith in calling off your 1965 concert israel missed the chance to learn from the most influential musicians of the decade and the beatles missed an opportunity to reach out to one of the most passionate audiences in the world
8699785 i think its fantastic and im waiting for my tickets i dont think it would have happened if ron prosor hadnt come here and presented his letter to john lennons sister and to myself the least we would expect in return is an invitation for the two of us to attend so ill be watching the post

8699790 it is scandalous that such titles should once again seem to be available from wh smith they appear to have failed to implement sufficient measures to guard against selling hate material
8699791 it is completely unacceptable that the vilest calumnies against the jews are being peddled by apparently respectable retailers without any indication of their falsity
8699792 unless smiths get their act together and withdraw these publications permanently and put clear mechanisms in place to ensure this does not recur then i will table an early day motion when parliament resumes in october to draw attention not only to this problem but to the fact this is not the first time
8699793 i think its appalling wh smith is supposedly a reputable bookseller and newsagent and i cant understand why they continue to promote this material which causes such offence

8699801 mainly we are trying to understand the magnetic fields around the pulsar and the emission mechanisms that are making the pulsars pulse
8699802 the gamma rays we found are being produced by this cloud of high speed particles circling around the pulsar
8699803 yielding insights into the processes and mechanisms involved in making a dead star so active
8699804 the high degree and direction of polarization at high energies reported by dean et al provide valuable information on the site of acceleration of the particles and on the structure of the magnetic field associated with the pulsar
8699805 the important thing we were trying to do in the first place is actually measure polarization because people havent been able to measure polarization to a good degree of accuracy before
8699806 it is in our view an important step forward to understanding the properties of the

8699872 er ist auf seiner position einer der besten spieler der welt und ein guter typ
8699873 das interessiert mich berhaupt nicht mir wurde in meiner aktiven karriere auch so viel nachgesagt blazenko f ngt hier bei null an ich denke er passt sehr gut in unser team

8699877 hamburg war immer ganz oben auf meiner liste schon vor meinem wechsel von gladbach nach m nchen jetzt war nat rlich mein gespr ch mit j rgen klinsmann der hauptgrund ich hatte das gef hl dass mein stellenwert und meine perspektive von ihm etwas anders gesehen werden als von mir deshalb habe ich auf den wechsel gedr ngt und scheinbar auch die richtigen worte gefunden um jetzt hier beim hsv zu sein
8699878 am mittwochmorgen wusste ich eigentlich bescheid tags ber regelten sich dann die dinge mein berater stand die ganze zeit mit dem hsv in kontakt
8699879 ich finde hier einen sehr guten verein vor bei dem ich mich entwickeln und gas geben kann viele spieler hier kenne ich schon aus meiner jugendzeit und von der spielphilosophie hat mir der hsv schon immer gefallen es passt zu mir
8699880 ich m chte das verk rpern was ich in gladbach getan habe ich bin eher ein offensiver linksverteidiger und will mich austoben in m nchen konnte ich diese rolle so nicht spielen
8699881 er war auf meiner liste aber ich dachte dass das unm glich sei

8699890 if we look at your average medieval town or your average greek polis most are about the scale of those we find in this part of the amazon
8699891 only the ones we find are much more complicated in terms of their planning
8699892 some of the practices that these folks hammered may provide alternative forms of understanding how to do low level sustainable development today
8699893 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns
8699894 if you find it in europe its a city if you find it somewhere else it has to be something else
8699895 they have quite remarkable planning and self organization more so than many classical examples of what people would call urbanism
8699896 this throws a wrench in all the models suggesting we are looking at primordial biodiversity
8699897 deze regel echter is me altijd bijgebleven en dringt zich telkenmale aan mij op als ik weer eens starend door het bedruppelde raam zit te hunkeren naar het reveille van de vroegkinderlijke herinnering aan eindeloos lange hete zomers
8699898 that way lay danger who knows what will happen when the dragons are slain

8699901 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8699902 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8699903 the theater had picked up eraserhead the dark surreal first film by a young david lynch for a friday midnight slot with the manic popularity of the rocky horror picture show the midnight movie trend had blossomed into a full fledged craze in the year since it had reinvented itself as an art house the nuart theatre had held down the saturday midnight slot with pink flamingos john waters cult raunchfest including scenes of public urination mother son fellatio consumption of dog feces and the infamous chicken fuck whose success was measured by how many people threw up in the aisles of a given showing and which based on that measure had been a consistent raving success eraserhead with its dark themes and obscure plot line lacked the ready hooks of those films and was going to be a gamble for the theater
8699904 the movie haunted him its strange musical set piece was particularly evocative a character known only as the lady in the radiator a platinum blonde in a shiny 50s era dress with strange mufflery protrusions emanating from her cheeks sings a song consisting mainly of five words repeated slowly and sweetly to beautiful and incredibly unsettling effect
8699905 devo arrived at bobs big boy and with everyone assembled synapses began to fire peter and lynch were clearly excited and more than a little surprised at the groundswell of interest eraserhead had begun to generate in l a in devo they recognized fellow travelers and were flattered by the bands request

8699908 we have mediated histories of her stories always told by others that leave it open to a great deal of interpretation and reinterpretation by each generation as they search for a usable harriet tubman
8699909 i have walked the earth since the morning of time ive seen so many little men squandering little lives in petty power struggles that bring meaning to an otherwise futile momentary existences

8699911 its like jennifer is on nothing less than a revenge tour while in the past jennifer shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8699912 since john said it was he who broke off their four month romance jennifer has kept a stiff upper lip and let her actions do the talking making sure everyone sees her smiling and looking sexy
8699913 jennifer was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend
8699914 more inclined than women to exhibit a range of risk taking behaviours while on the road more inclined to speed show aggression fall asleep behind the wheel and to identify themselves as impatient
8699915 joanna really trusts my driving and most of the time i trust hers
8699916 my instinct was to try and grab hold of the door
8699917 how he didnt take out oncoming traffic i dont know
8699918 we are finding our businesses are banding together well with shared information this kind of collaborative work with the business association and police is getting solid information
8699919 in a society when we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
8699920 with so many modes of communication available these days its difficult to keep track of your partners whereabouts or who theyre chatting to and when
8699921 flirting is age old but the fact that it can now be tracked on your phone makes a nervous partner a paranoid text checker
8699922 id met kim but i really got to know her in our wrestling scene theres hair pulling and i hurt my back and got some burn marks but its also sexy were sort of playing with the idea that guys get turned on by girls wrestling
8699923 we get into some down and dirty positions so its a good thing we became friends kim is so cool not to mention being hot
8699924 ive sort of created that image but its definitely a part of who i am one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in mini skirts and high heels twenty four seven and go to the gym in heels
8699925 when people see me dressed normally they cant believe it
8699926 i was offered playboy last year and again a couple of months ago and i did turn them down but thats not to say i wouldnt consider it in the future
8699927 i have no problems walking around the house naked or anything
8699928 im pretty confident with my bikini body its not like ive got a skinny body either its very voluptuous but i do like it and thats great i work out and eat healthy and listen to my body
8699929 ive never lost my curves and got skinny i guess working out and genetics have helped me in that department i dont believe in dieting to lose weight
8699930 there were no seats the crowd was so huge many of the people who poured into carriages got off just as quickly when they saw there were no seats
8699931 in otaki we have no choice the capital connection is our only commuter train
8699932 people may decide to go and sit on a loo normally if people sit on a toilet they shut the door the night before as people were looking for seats passengers were told to remove suitcases from seats and we made staff stand
8699933 i did not see masses of people standing but there were eight to 10 standing in the door wells between corridors

8699935 this is an unprecedented collection of madonna memorabilia that represents every stage of her glittering career
8699936 these are museum quality pieces but they will be presented in keeping with the glamour and sense of theatre that the queen of pop has made her trademark and madonna fans should be very excited indeed
8699937 it was important for patients to take extra care until they were properly healed so that is one area to look at as part of the investigations

8699940 first there is a mountain then there is no mountain first there is a mountain then there is no mountain then there is
8699941 things are symbolic for these are the two covenants the one from mount sinai which gives birth to bondage which is hagar for this hagar is mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children but the jerusalem above is free which is the mother of us all
8699942 you have not come to a mountain that can be touched a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them but you have come to mount zion and to the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to innumerable angels in festal gathering and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect and to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of abel
8699943 i thought that mountains were mountains and waters were waters
8699944 i want this but cant have it because a mountain stands in my may
8699945 he who did not spare his own son but delivered him over for us all how will he not also with him freely give us all things

8699950 i am to precede you and i have been made a witness upon you by allaah you will meet me at the haud tank very soon i have been given the keys of the treasures of the earth or the keys to the earth by allaah i do not fear for you that you will turn polytheist after me but i do fear for you that you will compete each other in acquiring the worldly riches
8699951 peace be upon you o inhabitants of the grave the morning that dawns upon you is more relieving than that which dawns upon the living afflictions are approaching like cloudy lumps of a dark night the last of which follows the first the last one is bearing more evil than the first
8699952 pour out one me seven qirab water skin pots of various water wells so that i may go out to meet people and talk to them
8699953 the curse of allaah falls upon the jews and christians for they made their prophets graves places of worship
8699954 he whom i have ever lashed his back i offer him my back so that he may avenge himself on me he whom i have ever blasphemed his honour here i am offering my honour so that he may avenge himself
8699955 i admonish you to be good to al ansar the helpers they are my family and with them i found shelter they have acquitted themselves credibly of the responsibility that fell upon them and now there remains what you have to do you should fully acknowledge and appreciate the favour that they have shown and should overlook their faults
8699956 the number of believers would increase but the number of helpers would decrease to the extent that they would be among men as salt in the food so he who from among you occupies a position of responsibility and is powerful enough to do harm or good to the people he should fully acknowledge and appreciate the favour that these benefactors have shown and overlook their faults
8699957 allaah the great has given a slave of his the opportunity to make a choice between whatever he desires of allaahs provisions in this world and what he keeps for him in the world but he has opted for the latter
8699958 upon hearing that abu bakr cried and said we sacrifice our fathers and mothers for your sake we wondered why abu bakr said such a thing people said look at that old man the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam says about a slave of allaah who was granted the right between the best fortunes of this world and the bounty of allaah in the hereafter but he says we sacrifice our fathers and mothers for your sake it was later on that we realised what he had aimed at the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam was the slave informed to choose we also acknowledged that abu bakr was the most learned among us
8699959 the fellow i feel most secure in his company is abu bakr if i were to make friendship with any other one than allaah i would have abu bakr a bosom friend of mine for him i feel affection and brotherhood of islam no gate shall be kept open in the mosque except that of abu bakrs
8699960 come here i will cause you to write something so that you will never fall into error
8699961 the prophet of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam is suffering from acute pain and you have the quraan with you the book of allaah is sufficient unto you
8699962 by the winds or angels or the messengers of allaah sent forth one after another
8699963 you women are like the women who tried to entice joseph yusuf into immorality convey my request to abu bakr to lead the prayer
8699964 while the muslims were performing the dawn prayer on monday led by abu bakr they were surprised to see the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam raising the curtain of aishahs room he looked at them while they were praying aligned properly and smiled cheerfully seeing him abu bakr withdrew to join the lines and give way to him to lead the prayer for he thought that the prophet sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam wanted to go out and pray
8699965 the muslims who were praying were so delighted that they were almost too enraptured at their prayers the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam made them a gesture to continue their prayer went into the room and drew down the curtain
8699966 the first time he disclosed to me that he would not recover from his illness and i wept then he told me that i would be the first of his family to join him so i laughed
8699967 he will not suffer any more when today is over
8699968 i still feel the painful effect of that food i tasted at khaibar i feel as if death is approaching
8699969 one of allaahs bounties upon me is that the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam died in my house while i am still alive he died between my chest and neck while he was leaning against me allaah has mixed his saliva with mine at his death for abdur rahmaan the son of abu bakr came in with a siwak i e the root of a desert plant used for brushing teeth in his hand while i was leaning the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam against me i noticed that he was looking at the siwak so i asked him for i knew that he wanted it would you like me to take it for you he nodded in agreement i took it and gave it to him as it was too hard for him i asked him shall i soften it for you he nodded in agreement so i softened it with my saliva and he passed it on his teeth
8699970 so he brushed his teeth as well as he could
8699971 there is no god but allaah death is full of agonies
8699972 with those on whom you have bestowed your grace with the prophets and the truthful ones the martyrs and the good doers o allaah forgive me and have mercy upon me and join me to the companionship on high
8699973 to allaah we turn and to him we turn back for help and last abode
8699974 i have never witnessed a day better or brighter than that day on which the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam came to us and i have never witnessed a more awful or darker day than that one on which the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam died on
8699975 o father whom his lord responded to his supplication o father whose abode is paradise o father whom i announce his death to gabriel
8699976 some of the hypocrites claim that the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam died the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam did not die but went to his lord in the same way as moosaa bin imran did he stayed away for forty nights but finally came back though they said he had been dead by allaah the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam will come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death
8699977 i sacrifice my father and mother for your sake allaah verily will not cause you to die twice you have just experienced the death that allaah had ordained
8699978 and now he who worships muhammad sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam he should know that muhammad sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam is dead but he who worships allaah he is ever living and he never dies allaah says muhammad sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam is no more than a messenger and indeed many messengers have passed away before him if he dies or is killed will you then turn back on your heels as disbelievers and he who turns back on his heels not the least harm will he do to allaah and allaah will give reward to those who are grateful aali imran 3 144
8699979 by allaah it sounded as if people had never heard such a quraanic verse till abu bakr recited it as a reminder so people started reciting it till there was no man who did not recite it
8699980 by allaah as soon as i heard abu bakr say it i fell down to the ground i felt as if my legs had been unable to carry me so i collapsed when i heard him say it only then did i realise that muhammad sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam had really died
8699981 i heard the messenger of allaah sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam say a dead prophet is buried where he dies so abu talhah radee allaahu anhu lifted the bed on which he died dug underneath and cut the ground for the grave it was a lahd type of grave with a niche in the side
8699982 we did not know that the prophet sall allaahu alayhi wa sallam was being buried till we heard the sound of tools digging the ground at the depth of the night before wednesday
