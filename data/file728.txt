7280002 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7280003 keep coming back to these two hearts two angels who have been rescued from the fall

7280007 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7280008 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7280009 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7280010 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7280011 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7280012 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7280013 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7280014 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7280015 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7280016 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7280017 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7280018 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7280019 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7280020 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7280021 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7280022 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7280023 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7280024 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7280025 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7280026 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7280027 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7280028 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7280029 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7280030 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7280031 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7280032 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7280033 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7280034 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7280035 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7280036 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7280037 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7280038 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7280039 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7280040 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7280041 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7280042 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7280043 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7280044 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7280045 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7280046 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7280047 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7280048 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7280049 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7280050 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7280051 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7280052 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7280053 who are open to doing something on the production side
7280054 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7280055 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7280056 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7280057 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7280058 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7280059 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7280060 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7280061 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7280062 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7280063 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7280064 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7280065 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7280066 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7280068 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7280069 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7280070 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7280071 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7280072 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7280073 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7280074 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7280075 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7280076 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7280077 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7280078 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7280079 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7280080 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7280081 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7280082 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7280083 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7280084 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7280085 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7280086 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7280129 here i have to reveal a trade secret which punctures the mystique of intelligence analysis generally speaking 80 of the information one needs to form judgments on key intelligence targets or issues is available in open media
7280130 in his usual form former un weapons inspector scott ritter told a packed crowd to stop whining about corporate media and become their own intelligence operatives we the people have the same resources and tools that intelligence networks rely heavily on its called google as our own intelligence operatives we cant allow cnn fox nbc and abc to edit and cherry pick information but ask questions and find the answers ourselves

7280133 if you look at many of the important leadership positions what you ll see are some of the most radical rabidly anti gun politicians on the planet
7280134 these are people who have been working for years in many cases decades to revoke or redefine our second amendment rights out of existence
7280135 from one end of capitol hill to the other many house and senate committees that matter to gun owners are chaired by anti gun extremists

7280220 we definitely do have a lot of experience because weve got four guys in the rotation and we all played a quality amount of snaps last year
7280221 we still just working like were young and were competing for the spot
7280222 starter is just a name because there are some games i end up playing as much as jeff played

7280235 the first shot fired from the zionist entity towards iran will be met by a response of 11 000 rockets in the direction of the zionist entity this is what military leaders in the islamic republic have confirmed
7280236 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7280237 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7280238 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7280239 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7280240 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7280241 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7280242 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7280243 the rise of the internet and bloggers has made the party more progressive
7280244 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
7280245 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help
7280246 i follow enjoy and am interested in politics the same way a lot of people in this country are with football
7280247 it signals a new beginning a new beginning for our country
7280248 i think well demonstrate how far weve come since dr kings speech
7280249 i just dont think i should be going to a national convention when we have problems here at home
7280250 id hate to see us divide the party but i understand the thought
7280251 to see her personally and get a feel for her personally should be completely different
7280252 i think it goes back to sen obamas experience in community service and community organizing
7280253 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7280254 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7280255 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7280256 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7280257 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7280258 they had to choose between picking experience and change and they ultimately made the decision that obama has already established himself as the change candidate and what he needed to shore up is the experience side that people had doubts about
7280259 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7280260 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans to this new cause and during those 18 months i must tell you frankly i have been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and gave in to the swift boat politics he once so deplored
7280261 he has been a huge supporter of israel and has been so in a very erudite fashion because he knows all the players not only in israel but in the palestinian authority
7280262 hes a true lunch bucket democrat its a perfect choice
7280263 a generation of democratic voters that sen obama is not doing as well with as he would like at this point would be very attracted to joe biden
7280264 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7280265 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7280266 i dont think it helps in terms of hillary supporters who are still upset or among women who he hasnt really reached out to
7280267 friend i have some important news that i want to make official ive chosen joe biden to be my running mate
7280268 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7280269 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7280270 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
7280271 to have an african american nominee is such a big step for the country with so many implications for change
7280272 finally they are giving us the full vote its too little too late it should have been done from the get go
7280273 im seeing activists that i never knew existed and hadnt come out of their shells until just now
7280274 obama certainly brought a lot of new voters to the primaries
7280275 but will this convention captivate large numbers of regular americans far more than previous conventions or will he just be talking to his followers
7280276 if its a food fight that might draw in viewers who otherwise would not watch
7280277 then its a question of whether they will be turned on or turned off by what they see
7280278 but im waiting to see how they treat hillary that is going to be very critical to whether people this fall will do more than cast a vote
7280279 the countys property tax collections grew 92 percent nearly five times greater than the combined 18 percent growth in county population and inflation figures
7280280 absolutely this election is one of those historic moments im doing everything i can to campaign for sen obama
7280281 we are doing what the obama campaign asked us to i was asked to come here and i came we have said we will do what we can and what were asked to do thats really in their hands as well
7280282 the obama campaign did not authorize and was not involved in the production or distribution of this document sen barack obama has not endorsed warren dawson in the primary for district 59 state representative
7280283 those old timers didnt want to teach us anything because they didnt want us to become the competition
7280284 when you go into the voting booth youre not voting for the picture
7280285 he treats people right gives great customer service offers a fair price and has done so consistently for years
7280286 you can always count on him to be there bottom line he works hard and thats the only way a small business like his can survive and prosper
7280287 i think hes a unique individual and really loves what he does to say the least
7280288 he gave us a little education on how his signs were produced you can tell by all the signs on the walls that hes done a lot of work over the years for some very influential people in the area and throughout florida
7280289 i found out when i got a call from a neighbor
7280290 she said les was running for something in hillsborough county would i be willing to help him out
7280291 oh lord how do i get my name off of there
7280292 she said she needed some help for les because he wanted to run for i forget what the hell it is
7280293 i read the paper and told her it meant i would be a committeeman
7280294 i already told you what i have to say if thats what they said you write what they said
7280295 she may still be running and if thats the case it changes the whole concept
7280296 we really want people to sign up who are interested in doing the job
7280297 these are hardcore democrats and they want to see change in this country
7280298 the convention will be a good opportunity for everybody to come together
7280299 when we see him giving so much respect and honor to her and her delegates its a step in the right direction
7280300 we will join her in supporting sen obama i think they have very similar views and both the clinton and obama campaigns have been working together since june to bring people together
7280301 there is a lot of ground to be made up there
7280302 after the conventions once everybody focuses on the two candidates head to head the country will see that our party is the right choice
7280303 i feel good about his chances i think its going to be an absolutely stunning victory for him
7280304 the country is ready for change and hes bringing a message thats acceptable to america
7280305 right now everybody says its a dead heat with mccain
7280306 he obama has a lot of work to do but i think he can do it hes got a good ground game in florida and theyre registering a lot of people
7280307 if the church people come out and vote i should win thats a plausible explanation of how it could happen
7280308 i woke up mad one morning i figured if im going to whine about it i need to suit up
7280309 in a plurality race its going to be in your base whose base is biggest
7280310 there are so many veterans in the area and im very organized
7280311 its been overwhelmingly positive i just had a mailer land today
7280312 i sent about 8 500 hand written letters people remember that
7280313 i think the governor should lock us in the senate and house until we can come out with a plan
7280314 its a good thing its off the ballot because its a bad idea
7280315 im a big fan of a consumption tax the state needs to tighten its belt
7280316 after a difficult tightly contested election campaign fought hard every step of the way i emerged victorious
7280317 roughly 19 000 ballots were invalidated because voters chose more than one candidate for president

7280336 the democratic party has chosen their nominee who reflects the issues and values of the party
7280337 sen obama offers a clear contrast with the republican nominee and i think sen biden complements him well
7280338 sen biden has repeatedly expressed his deep lack of faith in sen obamas experience
7280339 lets just say that now obama has some adult supervision in the form of joe biden
7280340 optimists say this is the best of all worlds pessimists sadly agree
7280341 if you see something you dont understand you have to ask why
7280342 mr campbell often admonished his students at ridgeview high school
7280343 and mickey gets cuter because walt disney makes more money that way
7280344 evolution has been the focus of a lot of debate in our state this year
7280345 if you read the newspapers everyone is arguing is it a theory is it not a theory the answer is we can observe it we can see it happen just like you can see it in mickey
7280346 i can see that theres no way i came from an ape
7280347 is this really what they want us to teach for the next 10 years
7280348 i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man
7280349 we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird
7280350 we also failed to include astrology alchemy and the concept of the moon being made of green cheese
7280351 i can do this until the end of the semester and i can only assume that it will work the same way each time
7280352 bryce what is it called when natural laws are suspended what do you call it when water changes into wine
7280353 it cant tell you whats right and wrong it doesnt address ethics but it is not anti religion science and religion just ask different questions
7280354 cant test it cant prove it cant disprove it its not a question for science
7280355 but there is scientific proof that there is a god
7280356 over in turkey theres a piece of wood from noahs ark that came out of a glacier
7280357 if i could prove tomorrow that that chunk of wood is not from the ark is not even 500 years old and not even from the right kind of tree would that damage your religious faith at all
7280358 and science is not based on faith i dont expect you to believe the scientific explanation of evolution that were going to talk about over the next few weeks
7280359 i still dont have a good feeling on how well any of them are internalizing any of this
7280360 its maybe the size of a dogs jaw or a cats
7280361 i think a big reason evolutionists believe what they believe is they dont want to have to be ruled by god
7280362 thats why people stand strong with christianity because it teaches people to lead a good life and not do wrong
7280363 ill watch the discovery channel and say ooh thats interesting
7280364 but theres a difference between thinking something is interesting and believing it
7280365 homo sapiens appeared in africa 200 000 years ago based on fossil and dna evidence
7280366 the fossil evidence of hominids alleged human ancestors is extremely limited
7280367 but theirs is a longer hand because they live in trees and their arms are very long
7280368 but this is happening over millions of years with humans if im lucky i might see four generations in my lifetime
7280369 then whatever we evolved from where did it evolve from
7280370 how does our hand go from being that long to just a smaller hand
7280371 individuals with small hands will have more children while those with bigger hands will disappear
7280372 but if we came from them why are they still around
7280373 just because a new population evolves doesnt mean the old one dies out
7280374 if the environment is suitable a species can go on for a long time
7280375 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7280376 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7280377 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7280378 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7280379 when you walk into here and see what youre going to be able to do you cant help but get excited
7280380 quality health care close to home for our veterans is critical
7280381 this new facility will bring state of the art equipment and procedures to the greater pensacola area and will lessen the requirement for veterans to make long trips for their medical care
7280382 local veterans have been saying for a number of years that the current clinic is undersized for the number of visitors they have
7280383 this new facility quadruples the size of the old clinic
7280384 there are a lot of vets around the country that have never experienced a new facility but in florida because of the growth weve been very fortunate to get a lot of dollars for facilities
7280385 were shoulder to shoulder with the navy working together to do whats best for the vets
7280386 we want them to feel like this is home like this is a good place to come get their care
7280387 we did that for the veterans it helps guide them through the building and it also reminds them who they are and what they used to do
7280388 its been an extremely rewarding experience because as far as we are concerned our patients are no 1
7280389 and the local people feel like they have a voice somebody to watch out for them they feel connected
7280390 i dont need you to tell me my opinion i know what i think about these issues ive been doing this for 35 years and nothing in this campaign will be new to me
7280391 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism
7280392 over the last eight years he has been a powerful critic of the catastrophic bush mccain foreign policy and a voice for a new direction that takes the fight to the terrorists and ends the war in iraq responsibly
7280393 he has really established himself as one of the small handful of this countrys wise men on us foreign policy
7280394 i told him he was welcome to use them whenever he liked with or without attribution
7280395 to the best of my knowledge anything that is embarrassing about my past is pretty well public record
7280396 any of you who take a look at my life will not be able to conclude that i am not an honorable man
7280397 very few people deserve to be called an exemplar of anything but he deserves to be called an exemplar regarding his relationship with his family
7280398 im here for your kids im here for the cops and the firefighters the teachers and the line workers the folks whose lives are the measure of whether the american dream endures
7280399 the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
7280400 the dream will endure as a legacy to the kennedys
7280401 the only moment of conciliation at that convention was the tribute to bob
7280402 i dont think many republicans would want their kids to get in the car with senator kennedy
7280403 there is a resonance with the kennedys that motivates people to act on the basis of compassion
7280404 a continuation of a certain way of viewing government they tried to keep breathing life into the new deal ted kennedy carries that on
7280405 the great senators stand for something and they stay a long time and get things done ted kennedy didnt change
7280406 if the weather holds out well get out there and do some more sign waving
7280407 we had a couple of days where we didnt have volunteers in the office
7280408 we kind of put the campaign to the side for a bit
7280409 today was a busy day the weather didnt deter us
7280410 i have been an opponent of the war in iraq since before the invasion
7280411 it is typical washington gamesmanship it is what mr feeney does while other people are dealing with their daily lives
7280412 you cant trust anything he says he is just playing political games
7280413 were going to make the rounds again just trying to get out there and meet people keep on shaking hands and keep talking to voters
7280414 this platform we are at today sits above a field of 160 million barrels of oil and is capable of producing on a daily basis 55 000 barrels of oil and 72 million cubic feet of natural gas
7280415 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7280416 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing
7280417 biden is comfortable on the attack and that will serve the ticket well the democrats have to have the capacity to counterattack and need someone like biden who is comfortable and has the reflexes to counterattack
7280418 americans are very skeptical of barack obamas credentials on national security and foreign affairs of the potential running mates biden clearly had the strongest credentials in that area the question is whether the voter in lima ohio will see bidens 35 years in the united states senate as enough to alleviate the uncertainty about barack obamas ability to run the country thats unknown
7280419 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7280420 we now have the ticket thats going to bring the change weve all been hoping for i join all of the members of the senate democratic caucus in congratulating joe biden
7280421 i think hes made a great pick with joe biden its not just foreign policy he has expertise in matters of the judiciary in his work for families
7280422 dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows the names of every train conductor on the way to wilmington
7280423 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7280424 im here for the cops and the firefighters and the teachers and the line workers the people who are the measure of whether the american dream endures
7280425 yielded to the very swift boat politics he once deplored
7280426 will have to figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7280427 his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century
7280428 enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7280429 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7280430 who shares my vision of an open government who calls all citizens to a common purpose
7280431 its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7280432 thats the american story its about if you get up you can make it thats the america barack and i agree on thats the american dream
7280433 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7280434 takes the partisan politics out of the public eye and into backrooms stocked with political insiders
7280435 hears the authority of a judge invoked in the political consequences of every day and he naturally concludes that in the united states judges are important political functionaries nevertheless when he examines the nature of the tribunals they offer at the first glance nothing that is contrary to the usual habits and privileges of those bodies and the magistrates seem to him to interfere in public affairs only by chance but by a chance that recurs every day
7280436 its been a kind of beyond your wildest dreams experience to be mentioned
7280437 it was very very flattering to be considered to be mentioned by folks for that position was very gratifying
7280438 when i signed on with senator obama it wasnt to get anything
7280439 my complete expectation is im going to be governor until january 2010
7280440 senator obama has made a great pick in joe biden
7280441 senator obama and senator biden will work very very well in virginia
7280442 i can tell you i suspect theres a great sigh of relief
7280443 there are a bunch of folks who have said i would really hate to lose tim as governor
7280444 democratic caucus and a likely candidate for governor next year said he was proud of kaine as well as sen mark r warner d who were also thought to be under consideration for showing the country that democrats are succeeding in virginia
7280445 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7280446 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7280447 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7280448 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7280449 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7280450 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7280451 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7280452 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7280453 we dont send a message to anyone who hasnt initiated contact with the campaign and opted in
7280454 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7280455 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7280456 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7280457 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7280458 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7280459 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7280460 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7280461 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7280462 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7280463 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7280464 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7280465 its nice that you can get a twofer with one of the heaviest hitters on foreign policy in the senate and also get someone who has the capacity to reach these lunch bucket voters
7280466 single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids
7280467 hes still one of the poorest members of the senate
7280468 he came to washington to do good not to do well for himself
7280469 most of those who are disappointed that hillary clinton was chosen will readily concede that joe biden is a solid choice and highly qualified avoiding some of the hard feelings that might have occurred if some of the lesser experienced contenders had been selected
7280470 if its a referendum on obama then the question is much less about how bad bush and mccain are and about how good really is obama
7280471 and thats where the doubts that the republicans have tried to create begin to seep in
7280472 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7280473 get your man in line in the house if this comes out of the senate
7280474 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
7280475 its no longer safe to answer your phone or watch tv
7280476 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7280477 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7280478 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7280479 its nice that you can get a twofer with one of the heaviest hitters on foreign policy in the senate and also get someone who has the capacity to reach these lunch bucket voters
7280480 single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids
7280481 hes still one of the poorest members of the senate
7280482 he came to washington to do good not to do well for himself
7280483 most of those who are disappointed that hillary clinton was chosen will readily concede that joe biden is a solid choice and highly qualified avoiding some of the hard feelings that might have occurred if some of the lesser experienced contenders had been selected
7280484 if its a referendum on obama then the question is much less about how bad bush and mccain are and about how good really is obama
7280485 and thats where the doubts that the republicans have tried to create begin to seep in
7280486 a chronic structural deficit that shows no sign of improving
7280487 it cost a whole lot of money for a very low turnout
7280488 i think weve got about 6 percent of registered voters voting which isnt high but is higher than usual for a primary
7280489 that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic the kind of fighter who i want by my side in the months and years to come
7280490 champ its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7280491 thats your story thats americas story its about if you get up you can make it
7280492 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7280493 that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7280494 tragedy tests us it tests our fortitude and it tests our faith
7280495 heres how joe biden responded he never moved to washington instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done
7280496 i have also heard that laughing is a good thing it costs nothing but makes everything seem more tolerable
7280497 wij kunnen de natuur aardig beheersen maar hebben niet de regie
7280498 in a blistering new ad john mccains campaign accused barack obama of passing over hillary clinton as his running mate because she pointed out his flaws during the democratic primaries
7280499 5 things obama needs for his convention week to succeed
7280500 and now the monkey is coming out of the sleeve
7280501 una v a que est abierta y que evidentemente se utilizar
7280502 dise ar una reacci n pol tica leg tima legal plenamente v lida
7280503 el otro d a ibarretxe alardeaba de que lo mejor de la consulta ha sido que ha puesto de acuerdo a aralar ea y pnv
7280504 eso quiere decir que ha vuelto la pol tica de bloques enfrentados
7280505 haya partidas que vayan destinadas a la pol tica frentista a avalar la consulta
7280506 una v a que est abierta y que evidentemente se utilizar
7280507 el problema es que el acatamiento se entienda como sumisi n
7280508 la asamblea nacional y el cuerpo directivo del pnv est como una sola persona detr s de esta posici n
7280509 una mala papeleta para un gobernante que se tenga por dem crata el impedir una consulta
7280510 tiene mucho de simb lico y tiene mucho tambi n de efectivo y real en un sistema democr tico
7280511 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7280512 the girls have never forgotten that reality tv gave them their break now they want to give someone else the chance to enjoy a taste of the success they have enjoyed
7280513 the winner will get to perform with the group on stage during a one off concert but the girls hope theyll be able to discover a hidden talent who could join the band as a fully paid up member
7280514 the girls have a huge amount of commitments outside the band it makes sense to look for someone who can stand in if one of them cant make a show
7280515 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7280516 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7280517 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7280518 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared
7280519 however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7280520 non credo che sapesse quanto era amato stata una sorpresa per tutti molti lhyears scoperto dopo la sua assenza i suoi testi esistono la sua voce la ascoltiamo ma la voce che conosco quando mi parlava mi manca tanto il suo mondo laveva dentro di s
7280521 some people might think im mad with all this money but trains are in my blood
7280522 my father and grandfather worked on the railways all their lives i couldnt spend the rest of my life on holiday
7280523 after the win i went on holiday to various resorts abroad but i coudnt see myself doing that for the rest of my life
7280524 we went to greece gran canaria tenerife and spain but after a few months of holidays i was itching to get back to work
7280525 i was disappointed to be told that i could not go back as a driver because my hearing wasnt 100 per cent
7280526 but i was delighted when they offered a job in the offices and i was thrilled to take it because it meant i was working with trains and my old workmates again
7280527 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack

7280537 i have a lot of friends who wont vote now because they wanted hillary
7280538 when they didnt get her they wanted the dream team and now they dont have that either well try biden well try anything to win but i dont know
7280539 how to soothe a group of very angry hillary people who think mr obama stole the primary from her
7280540 they all think the water will part if hillary walks
7280541 ive lived here 10 years and im not allowed to say one thing bad about the clintons they look at you
7280542 i dont know anything about him i dont trust him we know about hillary and we know her husband what do we know about obama hes a senator and all of a sudden hes in the highlight
7280543 i would not be involved with a presidential candidate that was anything other than 100 percent supportive of the state of israel
7280544 i had one woman in my building practically spit at me
7280545 she said any jew who votes for obama gets what they deserve
7280546 if she would just say she was running for vice president if he would just take her
7280547 they really really wanted hillary they get set in their ways and its hard to change their minds
7280548 i tell my mother we need the democratic party and thats what she should think about but she loved bill she loved hillary and thats her mindset
7280549 this really is a democratic stronghold and i think once they get over their disappointment and look at the issues they wont vote for john mccain
7280550 make people understand the importance of electing obama even if theyre not crazy about him
7280551 oo i saw stars falling all around her head red gold and blue sherry fraser where are you cause i saw stars falling all around your head when we were young sherry fraser where have you gone
7280552 yeah i guess zims pretty hoaaaaaaat kilaneka covered up what she was really going to say as zim walked in the room
7280553 yeah i guess zims pretty hoaaaaaaat kilaneka covered up what she was really going to say as zim walked in the room yaaaaay xd
7280554 yeah i guess zims pretty hoaaaaaaat kilaneka covered up what she was really going to say as zim walked in the room
7280555 und f r alle die das grundgesetz gerade nicht unter der achsel haben wir kommen wieder nach vorn
7280556 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7280557 thank you to china to all the wonderful volunteers and to bocog the beijing organizing committee
7280558 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7280559 it is clear that china has set the bar very high
7280560 its going to be a challenge not only for 2012 host london but also for all the successive games
7280561 through the games china has been scrutinized by the world and has opened up to the world the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world
7280562 positively influence the climate and the environment in all of china
7280563 the eligibility of the athletes is the responsibility of the federation not of the ioc but of course we considered this to be a very serious issue
7280564 they fig have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be okay
7280565 the federation wants to examine them thoroughly because they are established in chinese of course they will report to us as soon as possible
7280566 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come true with protests
7280567 the ioc is not a sovereign organization we have to respect chinese law
7280568 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands
7280569 i take it with a big smile i gave usain bolt what i believed to be fatherly advice i dont want to enter into a further polemic i stand by what i said he is a young man of 22 he has time to mature
7280570 i believe and my hope will be that london can even set the bar higher so we have this constant evolution and improvement of the olympic games
7280571 we havent won gold in eight years a lot of people doubted that nba stars could play together
7280572 after i got into foul trouble early i played a little cautious
7280573 but in the fourth quarter coach k told me to let that momma loose and thats what i tried to do
7280574 its so rewarding to see your hard work pay off
7280575 but kobe and dwyane got the ball and they were hot
7280576 i think when that kind of thing happens the guys get a good taste of whats important in life
7280577 we were crushed by that i mean when you go out on the court its just a game of volleyball
7280578 for four years these guys have played for the common goal to be here for this match
7280579 we put so much effort and energy into this thing and we spent so much time together
7280580 after a very good preparation i wanted to deliver to the spectators a wonderful show but i did not expect that my opponent would get injured
7280581 they took some great shots and were great on offense but we came out a little flat at the beginning of the game
7280582 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7280583 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired in the heat when i slow down
7280584 it was a little humid but i was able to pull away because i had enough power and speed to overcome it
7280585 it took a lot of training and its been a long road we are yet to fully comprehend this victory
7280586 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
7280587 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians
7280588 six years in sodom from the journal of james hartline
7280589 its not part of the story hes just an athlete
7280590 why do gays announce to the world that they are gay we dont tell the world that were straight
7280591 i found a russia on the move a russia that is trying to intimidate its neighbors who are democratic in nature
7280592 this georgia conflict is not about a border dispute its about the desire by russia to send a signal to its democratic neighbors that russia is a dominant power
7280593 i told mccain that there was unity in georgia russia is doing a lot of damage the poles and ukraine see this as a very big step in the wrong direction by russia
7280594 basically that your view john of russia being up to no good is correct
7280595 we cannot sit on the sidelines and allow energy supplies to be controlled by russia
7280596 we cant allow these young democracies to be intimidated by russia
7280597 it is clear that the russians tried to create this provocation
7280598 they were looking for this opening theyre trying to lure these young democracies into a fight
7280599 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7280600 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7280601 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7280602 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared
7280603 however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7280604 in the tragic air strike and irresponsible and imprecise military operation in azizabad village more than 89 of our innocent countrymen including women and children were martyred
7280605 we went to the area and found out that the bombardment was very heavy lots of houses have been destroyed and more than 90 non combatants including women children and elders have died
7280606 so far it is not clear for us why the coalition conducted the air strikes
7280607 kami beli elpiji dari kkks kontraktor kontrak kerja sama melalui tender dan diawasi bp migas badan pelaksana hulu minyak dan gas bumi silahkan cek ke bp migas

7280609 ada kritik juga dari kppu katanya pertamina tidak mau naikkan harga elpiji karena ingin memonopoli

7280614 within a couple hours though our beds and couches were delivered and the next day the rest of our stuff tables etc showed up as well the boxes of books and other stuff weve shipped to ourselves have also mostly arrived
7280615 the mark of christianity is the paradox the absolute paradox
7280616 if subjectivity is truth and subjectivity is the existing subjectivity then if i may put it this way christianity is a perfect fit subjectivity culminates in passion christianity is paradox paradox and passion fit each other perfectly and paradox perfectly fits a person situated in the extremity of existence
7280617 we have had a president for nearly 8 years who has committed almost nothing but gaffes every day
7280618 ill say yes to that idea but not because it is already running or anything im just saying yes because its possible i think it is possible sorry to say we dont have specific plans at the moment but it is possible yes
7280619 si nu l astept sa vina pe un cal alb si nici sa mi aduca un camp de flori si nu vreau sa mi dai rasaritul dimineata si nici sa mi dedici apusul drept un final poate ca nu mi as fi dorit niciodata nimic din toate astea poate ca era mai bine sa fiu asa cum vroiam si daca tot ce am si vad ma misca e pentru ca nu ma lasa rece ignoranta nu naste principii iar principiile nu nasc gelozii si tot ce simti intr un final te doare si uneori e mult mai bine sa nu vrei sa stii si fericirea costa mult si stiu ca s omul sadic si rece uneori si asta nu o sa se schimbe atata timp cat vad ceva mai mult din ce ar trebui

7280625 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7280626 saya masih menyimpan surat berbahasa inggris dan arab tetapi akan saya keluarkan setelah eksekusi
7280627 they are ready because they are not in a position to choose whatever the methods is
7280628 there are only two forces existing 1 the forces of allah 2 the forces of taghout 1 the forces of allah thoughts feelings speeches and actions are only listening to the law of allah islam and as sunnah 2 the forces of taghout thoughts feelings speeches and actions are not for the sake of allahs law islam therefore we are the forces of allah because we are clearly doing jihad fie sabilillah whereas they who work and struggle for the sake of kuhp indonesias book of criminal laws are obviously the forces of taghout satan starting from the president the judges prosecuting attorneys and the police as well as the executor who planned for our execution are the forces of satan

7280640 this is a critical national security program that has been plagued by technical design and development errors basic management blunders and poor government oversight
7280641 the program not only cant connect the dots it cant find the dots
7280642 the collapse of the railhead program appears to be the result of poor technical planning and design potential contractor mismanagement and inadequate government oversight
7280643 these same problems have emerged again and again on government programs as millions of dollars in taxpayer funding is squandered at some point the government needs to learn how to manage its technology programs so that they actually perform as advertised this episode is particularly disturbing since we are talking about the safety and security of 300 million american citizens
7280644 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7280645 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7280646 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7280647 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7280648 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size
7280649 we do the same thing if we have a jehovahs witness parent who is refusing to allow their child to have a blood transfusion or a hiv positive mother who does not agree to her baby being given hiv drugs we need to look after the childs rights
7280650 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7280651 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7280652 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7280653 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7280654 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
7280655 we knew the tr memorial would not be a memorial for the next hour or so but a stage on which young people bored by the specific flora and fauna around them would congratulate themselves before the cameras for their love of the earth

7280658 con lamministrazione attuale si evince dallepisodio riportato in calce allarticolo
7280659 ah del gruppo prisa so che cosa ti hanno mandato a chiedermi
7280660 m s bocas de expendio para vender m s publicidad
7280661 hay varias transgresiones a la ley de radiodifusi n en primer lugar una delegaci n de la explotaci n porque la fm 104 3 fue adjudicada en 2004 con un plan cultural algo que con la retransmisi n de los contenidos de la am qued en el olvido no est n cumpliendo el pliego presentado a la hora de pedir la frecuencuia
7280662 el estado ve como un privado deja de cumplir con el rol para el que la frecuencia le fue adjudicada y la vende la alquila a otra empresa en este caso continental que ya tiene una fm la 105 5
7280663 aqu no hay una cuesti n de libertad de prensa hay un tema de libre empresa quieren tener m s bocas de expendio para vender m s publicidad y ah trasgreden el impedimento que plantea la ley de tener dos licencias de servicio complementario en una misma rea de cobertura pretenden m s concentraci n en la emisi n
7280664 la medida es sospechosa y discriminatoria encierra una clara muestra de persecuci n no s lo hacia un medio sino tambi n hacia periodistas que ejercen una l nea cr tica
7280665 me llama la atenci n que otra vez uno de los perjudicados directos sea v ctor hugo morales a quien se le levant un programa en canal 7 sin argumentos serios adem s no podemos dejar de recordar la conferencia que dio el ex presidente n stor kirchner en la que atac en particular a un periodista de la radio
7280666 por qu toman decisi n tan apresurada si el gobierno est tan apurado deber a permitir una discusi n seria y profunda de c mo manejar el espectro radiof nico en el mbito del congreso estamos ante otra prueba del doble discurso del gobierno que por un lado cancela un espacio en fm porque duplica contenidos pero por el otro no explica c mo va a distribuir las licencias me pregunto qu van a hacer con el resto de las cadenas que hay en el pa s porque si revocan la licencia de continental tendr an que hacer lo mismo con todo el resto
7280667 no se pueden poner limitaciones al contenido de la informaci n que transmiten los medios con la nica excepci n de contenidos contrarios a los derechos humanos o los contenidos da inos para menores de edad
7280668 considerar que magdalena ruiz gui az representa alguno de esos l mites es una enfermedad de la democracia y eventualmente del funcionario que firma la resoluci n
7280669 estamos ante una t pica medida de discrecionalidad del comfer claramente discriminatoria y sin fundamento
7280670 vuelve a aparecer con claridad la tendencia del gobierno a utilizar elementos leg timos como es la elaboraci n de un proyecto de ley en funci n de sus intereses particulares
7280671 el diario el pa s ha escrito editoriales particularmente duros contra el gobierno y en continental est n dos periodistas claramente cr ticos como ruiz gui az y morales
7280672 casualmente el gobierno se ocupa de esta repetidora cuando hay innumerables repetidoras en las mismas condiciones funcionando en todo el pa s
7280673 la medida dispuesta por mariotto condiciona y obstruye la libertad de expresi n y representa un error sin precedentes en gobiernos democr ticos

7280676 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7280677 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7280678 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7280679 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7280680 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7280681 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7280682 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem
7280683 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7280684 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7280685 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7280686 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7280687 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size
7280688 we do the same thing if we have a jehovahs witness parent who is refusing to allow their child to have a blood transfusion or a hiv positive mother who does not agree to her baby being given hiv drugs we need to look after the childs rights
7280689 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7280690 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7280691 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7280692 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7280693 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
7280694 itd be nice to get a championship ring on top of this
7280695 weve got a great squad back in salt lake and weve got a great chance of winning that thing

7280704 that was a great night for the jack daniels chevrolet
7280705 we got caught up in someone elses mess and gil and all the guys did an awesome job fixing the car so we could keep racing it was a total team effort tonight
7280706 on behalf of the european commission i want to congratulate the hundreds of european athletes who have participated in the beijing olympic games
7280707 the past two weeks have provided european athletes with yet another opportunity to show themselves at their best and they have certainly not disappointed millions of supporters
7280708 european athletes have not only delivered excellence in competitions as testified in the individual achievements of each participating countries but they have also demonstrated that team work and fair play are key values to the sporting community of our continent and to all europeans

7280714 require that 10 percent of our energy comes from renewable sources by the end of my first term more than double what we have now
7280715 we will get 1 million 150 mile per gallon plug in hybrids on our roads within six years
7280716 i will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming an 80 percent reduction by 2050
7280717 in colonial days when the only fuel we burned was wood

7280731 there is a vitality a life force an energy a quickening that is translated through you into action and because there is only one of you in all time this expression is unique and if you block it it will never exist through any other medium and be lost the world will not have it it is not your business to determine how good it is or how valuable or how it compares with other expressions it is your business to keep the channel open you have to keep open and aware directly to the urges that actuate you keep the channel open

7280734 everyone has a talent what is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark place where it leads
7280735 i believe we have been robbed of our true biography that destiny written into the acorn and we go to therapy to recover it that innate image cant be found however until we have a psychological theory that grants primary psychological reality to the call of fate otherwise your identity continues to be that of a sociological consumer determined by random statistics and the unacknowledged daimons urgings appear as eccentricities compacted with angry resentments and overwhelming longings repression the key to personality structure in all therapy schools is not of the past but of the acorn and the past mistakes we have made in our relations with it we dull our lives by the way we conceive them

7280740 we dont think its a big advance to be able to pose something as a question as opposed to keywords typing what is the capital of france wont get you better results than capital of france
7280741 we think that whats important about natural language search is the mapping of words to concepts that users are looking for

7280744 according to an e mail message dated november 1 2002 that has been entered as evidence in the iowa consumer antitrust case against microsoft some microsoft executives favored hiding the fact that microsoft paid international data corp idc for one of the total cost of ownership studies comparing windows and linux that the firm conducted at microsofts request
7280745 i dont like it to be public on the doc that we sponsored it because i dont think the outcome is as favorable as we had hoped i just dont like competitors using it as ammo against us it is easier if it doesnt mention that we sponsored it
7280746 for the past few weeks ive been kind of compartmentalizing my emotions finally the filters came down
7280747 obviously this doesnt change anything because it doesnt bring todd back and cant vindicate it
7280748 but i can enjoy this and mourn todds death at the same time its just something i have to do
7280749 he has taken this program a long way he had a smile on his face and we havent seen that in a long long time it was a beautiful thing
7280750 hugh said he doesnt wear his heart on his sleeve but he does
7280751 i think it fueled his fire even more to lead us to this victory
7280752 it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under my feet
7280753 the bottom line is i was working on it i was throwing out and giving away things every day
7280754 theres no blame for how our love did slowly fade and now that its gone its like it wasnt there at all and here i rest where disappointment and regret collide lying awake at night up all night when im lying awake at night
7280755 the let lashkar e tayyaba militant is the cousin of iqbal malik and he is working with him only we have recovered 195 000 rupees from him
7280756 i was a militant since 1999 i got my three months training in pakistan i came back to india in 2000 then i went to lucknow there i worked for some time then i went to jammu there i surrendered after i was released from the jail i went to himachal and it has been some two three years that i have been living there
7280757 this is my message to the leadership of the country we are with you as long as we are able to resolve the kashmir problem through dialogue peaceful means we are against violence any kind of violence be it from that side or this side we will not take it i repeat it again if there is a thought that we will suppress the peaceful protests through suppression by running around more security personnel i think we will not be this side then we will have to be on the side of the innocent people who are fighting for justice who are fighting for the resolution of the kashmir problem
7280758 a total of 586 blood samples have been taken and those patients who have tested positive for malaria are being attended to and given all necessary treatment we are also spraying in the areas fogging and spraying of ddt is also taking place in those areas
7280759 many children in our village were running high temperature but when two children died our village head informed the hospital authorities which then sent a team here the team referred us to this hospital where those suffering from malaria are being treated
7280760 this is last day for beijing olympics and the tibetans in dharamsala and all over the world will be protesting against the chinas illegal occupation of tibet this is not the end of the protest these protests will continue and the tibetans and the supporters of tibet will keep on fighting chinese illegal occupation of tibet
7280761 there is a 500 acre low lying land near the project site where the ancillary units can come up and the government can decide on it if the government agrees we will show it to them
7280762 that is an old proposition that will not solve the problem
7280763 the international situation in recent weeks has seen a increase in tensions which is very worrying
7280764 risk of a deterioration in the climate of trust between nations
7280765 recent events have weakened many peoples confidence that such experiences had been confined definitively to the past
7280766 nationalist confrontations which produced so many tragic consequences in other seasons of history
7280767 we are now present in 45 cities with 207 outlets and by end of the current fiscal we will add 10 more cities and take the total number of our outlets to 250 this is part of our rs 80 crore investment plan on store expansion in the current year
7280768 we plan to have a total of 500 stores in 75 80 cities by 2010 11 it would entail an investment of rs 200 crore during the period
7280769 during last four months we have opened outlets in jammu panipat surat baroda nashik trivandum meerut and patiala while earlier 70 per cent of our business used to be in metros and mini metros now the ratio is 50 50 between big cities and smaller tier ii and iii cities
7280770 we are the largest player and are aiming for 45 per cent share in the market which will grow to rs 650 700 crore by end of the current fiscal
7280771 we are transforming our brand slogan with our newly launched rs 35 pizza mania from hungry kya which had a comic message we are now moving to khushiyo ki home delivery where we are portraying a more serious message with a new television advertisement
7280772 american people understand where we are with the economy everything that is up should be down everything that is down should be up
7280773 looking back to the time that president bush took office eight years ago there was a surplus of usd seven trillion were now usd 11 trillion in debt we have the housing market which has collapsed we have the energy industry which is putting pressure on everyone
7280774 the last couple of weeks if you had asked me that i would have said i cant wait till its over ive mixed feelings
7280775 its obviously been a long association and i have had some fantastic times
7280776 this year has been a nightmare but i guess if you put it in with all the great times ive had then its not so bad
7280777 but this year has been extremely frustrating and disappointing its nobodys fault its just one of those things that happens in sport all the time
7280778 i thought jamal idris made a terrific debut he showed hes a good first grader of the future
7280779 his first 20 minutes was fantastic the pace of it caught up with him a little bit i think and he started cramping 15 to 20 minutes into the second half
7280780 but he certainly showed his strength and his speed and he can certainly jump and catch the ball
7280781 whether he stays there in first grade or not its hard to say but certainly on that performance you would think he would be there next week
7280782 he played well i thought he handled the step up pretty good and he was a handful
7280783 i thought they played particularly well probably the best theyve played for a long time
7280784 paramedics from the response vehicle travelled with the ambulance crew and provided additional assistance while the man was treated on route to hospital
7280785 but unfortunately despite the best efforts of paramedics and hospital staff they were unable to save him
7280786 its all drug and gang related theres just not enough policing in the area we need more officers on the beat
7280787 if they see more officers about then maybe it will deter them from coming into this area
7280788 fig tells us however they want to examine them thoroughly because they are established in chinese of course and they will report to us as soon as possible
7280789 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared
7280790 however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7280791 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7280792 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed
7280793 son incidentes que ocurren habitualmente es el pan de todos los d as
7280794 en la capital federal y el conurbano bonaerense funcionan varios carteles internacionales de drogas donde interviene traficantes productores exportadores compradores y proveedores de distintas nacionalidades
7280795 el barrio de villa soldati est copado por mafiosos de paraguay constituci n est captado por dominicanos los bolivianos hacen negocio con todos son cuentapropistas los mexicanos tiene oficinas en puerto madero los peruanos ocupan espacio en la villa 1 11 14 los colombianos est n por todo pilar y por supuesto tenemos grupos locales
7280796 la vulnerabilidad de los controles fronterizos a reos terrestres y mar timos son el principal problema
7280797 hay zonas que parecen intocables como territorio liberado para el narcotr fico por ello los grupos internacionales comenzaron a ver el negocio aqu y naturalmente abrieron sus cocinas
7280798 el laboratorio de drogas que se logr desbaratar en ingeniero maschwitz propiedad de mexicanos fue un golpe importante pero apenas la punta del iceberg de un fen meno lamentable ya instalado en el pa s
7280799 por el tipo de instalaciones que encontraron en la argentina la edad y la procedencia de todos los mexicanos detenidos all y por el destino de los cargamentos de efedrina contrabandeada desde buenos aires quien est instalado en la argentina es el cartel de sinaloa
7280800 para nosotros no es una sorpresa que el cartel de sinaloa llegue a buenos aires en la argentina seguramente hay una fiebre de autorizaciones legales que est n permitiendo el ingreso de sustancias que en un amplio porcentaje no est n destinados a la industria de los medicamentos
7280801 el gobierno es consciente de lo que est pasando nosotros le pedimos una reuni n al embajador de los estados unidos earl wayne y hablamos con tony grecco el representante de la dea para que aporten informaci n
7280802 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7280803 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt
7280804 for the last fortnight all weve heard is that rangers and celtic get every decision going this has obviously shown that isnt the case and never has been the case
7280805 obviously im a little bit disappointed that we didnt get what looked a perfectly good goal at the end
7280806 i just hope that referees and linesman are not bowing to the pressure that has been placed on them in that respect
7280807 i was really disappointed that decision was given in the light of whats been going on for the last couple of weeks
7280808 weve had two very difficult games and i feel we are improving with each game
7280809 it will probably go down in history as one of the greatest olympic games ever
7280810 im kind of crazy cause im watching the game all over again in my head
7280811 the intensity of the game was unbelievable i think you guys felt the intensity so if you guys felt it you know how crazy it was for us
7280812 everyone wants to talk about nba players as selfish as arrogant
7280813 it helped we had no problems with him saying that we all believed it when a teammate goes all out we all go out if your best player is going to say that youre going to support him
7280814 we wanted to take the low road but lebrons lebron
7280815 hes going to say what we feels in his heart
7280816 every guy on this team backs him he went out on a limb way back when and said look we cant be beat and we werent so you might want to start asking him about stock tips and other things he might be nostradamus
7280817 there was a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7280818 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions will be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7280819 if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7280820 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7280821 we are sure the event will be held in pakistan next year
7280822 the ecb board made it clear to icc chief executive haroon lorgat at a meeting at lords last week that ecb had a duty of care for england players and officials as well as a desire to ensure the interests of the media and spectators were not compromised
7280823 the ecb explained their reservations and security concerns about staging the tournament in the aftermath of the resignation of the pakistan president pervez musharraf last monday these concerns were shared by four other competing countries
7280824 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7280825 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7280826 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7280827 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7280828 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7280829 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7280830 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7280831 figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7280832 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the centre of an international crisis
7280833 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7280834 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7280835 the bad blood between the two the role of former president clinton in the campaign the concern that the clintons would be very difficult if sen obama becomes president i think those are all factors
7280836 but he should have chosen hillary as his running mate
7280837 i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training i stand by my statement
7280838 iwould be honoured to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7280839 sebanyak 40 persen lainnya hanya berupa sisa sisa bangunan benteng
7280840 saat kami melakukan pendataan di indonesia timur data awal kami ada 100 benteng tetapi saat pendataan di lapangan kami menemukan ada 107 benteng jumlah itu saja masih mungkin bertambah karena kami sempat kesulitan mencapai beberapa lokasi yang disurvei
7280841 setelah ada pendataan dan inventarisasi ini kami tinggal mengajukan ke pemerintah agar benteng benteng ini dimasukan sebagai benda cagar budaya yang dilindungi
7280842 theres just about everything you can imagine going on in this garage people talking to people
7280843 the funny thing is that the rumors that i hear were involved with were not and the ones i dont hear about are the ones were talking with
7280844 were evaluating all our options for next year to be able to build a great team and be competitive in the future
7280845 as we look at other teams situations some of them require different manufacturers and were having those conversations as well

7280856 we must have public officials who will stand up and tell the people exactly what they think our failure in recent years has not been the failure of the people to meet the challenges placed before them but rather the failure of both our great political parties to place those challenges honestly and courageously before the people

7280887 as president i have pledged that i will provide at least 50 billion by 2013 to combat hiv aids tuberculosis and malaria millions of lives are at stake we must make an investment that matches the scale of the epidemics
7280888 over one million people die yearly from malaria a preventable disease i have long supported efforts to develop a vaccine for malaria and as president i would expand these efforts and i would make it a priority to increase access to prevention tools we know they work in the 21st century no one should be dying from mosquito bites
7280889 the health and welfare of women and children are the foundation of every family community and nation as a senator i have introduced legislation to safeguard women and children in refugee and idp camps and i am the author of the international violence against women act as president i would build on these efforts to address the interlinked health needs and human rights of women and children
7280890 i co sponsored the education for all act and i have long supported universal primary education its the foundation of democracy an investment in the future and the most powerful tool we have to empower women universal primary education is simply put a fundamental need
7280891 water born diseases are one of the leading killers of children under five hunger and malnutrition threaten the health and well being of millions more global warming will just make these problems worse as chair of the senate foreign relations committee i have seen the consequences of unsafe water and inadequate food around the world as president i would invest in helping countries tackle these challenges as part of a comprehensive health and development strategy
7280892 care packages internships scholarships and other support give these young people hope
7280893 youre not the only one that needs food asshole i have an entire dining room in there and theyre hungry ill send your fucking soup out with that dumb ass runner jose when im done pissing it out of my ass
7280894 i had a good start to the race and gained three places to 13th but that was the highlight of my race really
7280895 we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid after we had expected to perform a lot better i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
7280896 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pit lane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race we need to get to the bottom of the brake problems that we have had all weekend as these cost me a lot of time and positions it was a poor weekend overall
7280897 jenson got a good start and was able to make up three places during the first lap however the midfield was quite close today and with a heavy fuel load he was unable to progress through the field starting rubens from the pit lane was the right decision as he benefited from the mel e at turn 2 and ended up being further up the field than he would otherwise have been contrary to expectation though there was relatively low attrition with only three cars failing to finish and no safety cars which meant there were no real opportunities to take advantage of
7280898 after qualifying yesterday i knew that me weekend was going to be difficult
7280899 at the start i was touched by nakajima and i lost my rear wing my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for the supporters who came here this weekend to support me i now want to concentrate on the rest to the season and the next race in spa
7280900 the first lap was rough as i was in the middle of the pack and lost several positions after that i tried to fight back but my front wing was damaged and it was difficult to overtake its a shame that we couldnt get into the top ten but i hope we can have a better race in spa for the belgian grand prix in a couple of weeks time
7280901 its a weekend to forget our objective remains to fight for fourth place in the championship and we must now stay focussed for the races to come and continue with our efforts to grow stronger
7280902 that was a good result and a great performance by the team
7280903 the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7280904 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
7280905 this has turned into one of those good weekends after qualifying everybody was a bit disappointed but today went much better due to excellent teamwork after jarno missed saturdays practice session the crew put timos set up into jarnos car and he delivered a very good performance and a very smooth race to 5th place today timo was not feeling well but he made an excellent start managed his tyres well and put in a huge effort to complete this race with the best result im very happy that we are confirming our good pace now we will push to keep these results coming with a particular eye on the japanese grand prix later in the season

7280939 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck
7280940 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7280941 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7280942 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7280943 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me

7280956 we wanted to take the low road but lebrons lebron

7280972 russias invasion of its neighbour is a clear demonstration that the us led effort to integrate postsoviet russia into the west has failed
7280973 a cold war mentality will strengthen on both sides the georgians hope to integrate quickly with europe and nato has been at best set far back

7281086 his point was that schools shouldnt ban the use of the devices but learn from the students and also create an environment that promotes technology
7281087 its exciting but i think we need to stay focused on what the outcomes are for kids as far as content
7281088 if a student brings their own laptop is it going to be on the schools network then what about viruses and filtering
7281089 im not sure schools are quite comfortable with it yet
7281090 one of the things weve talked about in proctor and west rutland because we have the small schools is maintaining the diversity of classes with a low enrollment with the camera software we could perhaps offer the class at one school and have students at the other taking it
7281091 what people are most excited about and interested in is all the negative stuff out there i liken the experience to taking your kids to washington d c there are streets that you better not let them go down and there are others that they shouldnt die without seeing
7281092 how do you accommodate the students that dont have the technology how do you equalize the access
7281093 its a way we can introduce math concepts without any kind of stress on the student without them having to memorize a bunch of rules first
7281094 we didnt want the kids to have to sell half of it to keep half of it
7281095 gritar a al mundo para que se entregue y responda a las terribles acusaciones

7281105 it was a shame to fight with him in the pit lane
7281106 we were side by side i was the lead car and he the lapped car but the gap was narrow and i didnt want to take much of a risk
7281107 i had to back off and i lost time but fortunately it was not too much
7281108 ive had a few problems health wise but ive pulled through
7281109 it was a hot weekend and i didnt have enough water it was like driving in a sauna but im pretty happy with the way ive come through it
7281110 the team has got some solid points me and heikki and it has been a solid weekend for us

7281127 no puedo casi recordar cuando vi a mi padre por ltima vez en 1962 crec sin padre en casa de mis abuelos ni se donde vive ni financio su huida si estuviese muerto desconozco tambi n donde puede estar su tumba
7281128 entre 1962 y 1967 encontramos dos notas en nuestro buz n en ellas figuraba una nica frase estoy bien pero no puedo asegurar que esas cartas fueran realmente de mi padre
7281129 gritar a al mundo para que se entregue y responda a las terribles acusaciones

7281152 there was a reference in the earlier u s draft to the desirability of india eventually accepting the npt and its safeguards that was more positive than what we have now
7281153 so i think america will have to come back to us with a new draft before any decision is possible
7281154 the group crossed the line and that while they may seem to be stifling public debate they are actually encouraging it
7281155 in a free society healthy public debate requires giving people some leeway to speak but accusing people of criminal acts without any evidence is defamation if people are going to start resorting to that any kind of intelligent public discourse is going to break down
7281156 these groups are allowed to make almost any claim they wish regardless of the facts and the media rarely question them
7281157 now the old king is dead long live the king
7281158 in my view they wont do aggressive counterinsurgency because they cant

7281188 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7281189 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7281190 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7281191 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
7281192 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7281193 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7281194 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7281195 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7281196 the more people learn about them obama and hillary and how they handle the pressure the more their support will evaporate
7281197 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
7281198 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
7281199 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
7281200 frankly i think im more qualified than other candidates and the issues facing the american public are all in my wheelbarrow

7281207 its just like sometimes you see some of the biggest rallies in stocks during the start of a bear market or even during a bear market
7281208 it seems like the slowdown in industrial world growth has finally cut the legs out from under the commodity rally for now
7281209 and now its really on chinas shoulders and the rest of the developing world to see whether they can hang in there
7281210 our own view is that china will do surprisingly well over the next year but whether thats enough to get oil prices rising is doubtful
7281211 the consensus is we will get some very modest growth in the second quarter were looking at all of a 0 6 per cent annualized rise in gdp which just barely offsets the decline we saw in the first quarter
7281212 it should be just enough to keep the economy out of a technical recession i think the economy will be fortunate to turn out much growth in the second half of the year either

7281236 obama has been outspoken about contributions from lobbyists vowing not to accept any contributions from them biden doesnt seem to have quite the same view
7281237 i have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on lobbyists and won
7281238 they have not funded my campaign they will not run my white house and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president
7281239 next president would be the guy landing helicopters inside the green zone taking people off the roof
7281240 a surge of up to 30 000 american troops cannot have any positive effect
7281241 as i said on thursday i needed to wait and speak to the player when he returned from international duty and then make a decision about whether or not he was right to play in this game
7281242 i have not selected him as i do not think that he was focused enough and i did not feel that he would be good for the dressing room and the team effort
7281243 it doesnt matter how good a player is if he is not in the right frame of mind then he will not perform well the only thing i concern myself with is picking the best team to try and win the game

7281249 since our population is living longer people are developing higher expectations for a better quality of life in their senior years
7281250 its vital that we teach people how to keep their bodies and minds working at their full capacity
7281251 the medical community once thought that while the body benefited from good health choices very little could be done to help regenerate the brain we now know that the brain is very resilient and it is possible to keep the brain sharp and agile as one grows older
7281252 its never too late to improve your health if you havent had a recent medical check up then schedule a physical exam the results will show the current status of your health and reveal any underlying medical concerns this will give you a basis for creating a proactive program that you can integrate into your life if you take these steps you will have a healthier body and mind to enjoy your senior years to the fullest

7281268 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7281269 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7281270 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7281271 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7281272 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7281273 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7281274 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7281275 rising health insurance costs in massachusetts where possession of insurance is required by state law are in large part attributable to onerous mandatory minimum coverages the state government requires in every policy sold in the state a new state government study shows
7281276 an assessment conducted by the massachusetts division of health care finance and policy mdhcfp found 12 cents of every 1 spent on insurance premiums in the state goes toward paying for those mandated benefits a cost to consumers of more than 1 3 billion per year
7281277 mid range estimates in the three to four percent of premium range roughly 300 million to 400 million annually may be a reasonable estimate of the mandate laws marginal impact on health care costs directly associated with the covered benefits described in the laws

7281281 this shows that titan pokers jackpot tournaments are very popular and are continuing to grow at a fast rate
7281282 but let us get back to all the sex going down in the village one possible explanation centres on the fact that olympic athletes have to display an unnatural and it has to be said wholly unhealthy level of self discipline in the build up to big competitions how else is this going to manifest itself than with a volcanic release of pent up hedonism it is a common sight to see recently knocked out athletes gorging on magnums and mcdonalds swilling alcohol and of course shagging like crazy sometimes all three at the same time yet this can be only a part of the explanation because most of the athletes i know are as up for it before and during competition as they are in the immediate aftermath it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
7281283 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans
7281284 you knew that the bombs were dropping in that direction and the guns pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people

7281370 do not interpretations belong to god please tell them to me
7281371 in my dream there was a vine before me and on the vine there were three branches as soon as it budded its blossoms shot forth and the clusters ripened into grapes pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaohs cup and placed the cup in pharaohs hand
7281372 this is its interpretation the three branches are three days in three days pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office and you shall place pharaohs cup in his hand as formerly when you were his cupbearer only remember me when it is well with you and please do me the kindness to mention me to pharaoh and so get me out of this house for i was indeed stolen out of the land of the hebrews and here also i have done nothing that they should put me into the pit
7281373 i also had a dream there were three cake baskets on my head and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for pharaoh but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head
7281374 this is its interpretation the three baskets are three days in three days pharaoh will lift up your head from you and hang you on a tree and the birds will eat the flesh from you

7281428 everyone else is commenting on it so ill just leave it to others
7281429 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan
7281430 i would expect it would be around that time that he would make it clear what his future intentions are

7281435 its hard when you are running sporting clubs and its also hard for volunteers to actually be enforcing bans

7281438 our club has a rule that if you chance it then you will be asked to leave
7281439 in the absolute worst circumstances violence should be reported to the police
7281440 if they cross the line the codes of conduct need to be enforced whether that means banning parents from a game or banning them for a year its up to the clubs and leagues
7281441 in a minority of cases we do see occasions where spectators cross the line from being passionate about their kids on the field to extreme behaviour whether verbal abuse or physical abuse
7281442 this is about people pulling their heads in we want to encourage those clubs and leagues to actually enforce those codes and help tackle this problem head on

7281458 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7281459 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games

7281473 stockwell day diane finley and stephen harper should respect the will of parliament and the canadian people and stop this deportation immediately
7281474 the house of commons has passed a motion supporting a special programme that would allow conscientious objectors who refuse to serve in the war in iraq to remain in canada the government must respect this action by the house and stop deportation action against robin long and other iraq war resisters
7281475 the canadian government and the canadian people do not support george bushs illegal war in iraq we must have the courage of those convictions and back them up by ensuring that americans who take a stand against that war receive a welcome in canada
7281476 the sentence was the longest any convicted army deserter had received since the beginning of the 2003 iraq war said retired u s army col ann wright a former diplomat who resigned from her post out of protest at the wars outset wright testified against the legality of the iraq war on longs behalf of the thousands of soldiers sentenced for desertion or going awol and the estimated two dozen tried for protesting the war only former army sergeant kevin benderman received an equal sentence in 2005
7281477 hes a young man who is a very good man
7281478 hes got principles honor and courage four or five months is pretty common among all the ones who have gone awol and been public about it

7281480 he felt good that he got to speak his mind about why he did what he did he knows that he did the legally wrong thing but the morally right thing
7281481 i must have been drunk i was wrong the iraq war is a gift from heaven

7281506 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given
7281507 i thank god that i have a senator joining me in this objection i appreciate senator boxers willingness to listen to the plight of hundreds and even thousands of ohio voters that for a variety of reasons were denied the right to vote unfortunately objecting to the electoral votes from ohio is the only immediate avenue to bring these issues to light while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today if they are willing stand at the polls for countless hours in the rain as many did in ohio then i can surely stand up for them here in the halls of congress

7281521 uh no patti we dont when jim mentioned your interview in
7281522 that you of all people would declare barack deserves all of our support is not only laughable its incredibly ignorant remember
7281523 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations
7281524 any of my opponents about what this country means what makes it great
7281525 at least level with your readers mr herbert tell them that you think the two major parties republican and democrat own all the voters and theres no one else on the ballot at least level with them

7281527 the role i want to play is to move my states education system and my states economy full fledged for the 21st century
7281528 what you have out of the second generation is frankly a slightly different agenda and a more mellow message
7281529 the message and tone are compromising and is less about race and more about social progress and more about economic mobility
7281530 i would say that he certainly is a moderate democrat by national democrat standards and hes also a blue dog democrat attaching himself to moderate democrats across the country
7281531 he is familiar with the issues and has tried to gain the respect of democrats and republicans in the state

7281536 sign into law the family and medical leave act which george bush vetoed in 1990 so that no worker is forced to choose between keeping his or her job and caring for a newborn child or sick family member
7281537 who worry about how they can balance the demands of motherhood and work how they can do right by their children well ill tell you one thing if we had a president who would sign instead of veto the family and medical leave act theyd be better off and im going to give that to them

7281542 i have no desire to take a federal position ive said nice stuff about obama because ive had the privilege of working closely with him
7281543 its a lot of rah rah try to fire up the troops

7281553 let us protect our newsrooms and encourage more and more journalists to become experts in the areas they are reporting from and give them more time to understand the cultures they are reporting from
7281554 i have come across great figures in journalism but also a lot of people who have landed there and rushed to the screen and didnt have the opportunity to understand
7281555 our reporting is about life and death our reporters sometimes pay with their life for the truth
7281556 we are journalists and we should always hold the values of journalism before any other consideration
7281557 i do think hard about sending news crews to somalia because the risks are extraordinary
7281558 it does fall into the category of is this a war worth dying
7281559 for what it must have cost taxpayers to have them police following us around they could have fixed up some of the roads
7281560 it is a big issue to have 500 motorbikes parked in one street its a nightmare to deal with and its a big safety issue
7281561 the young men who come in from outer suburbs to drink alcohol and assault gay people are not going to be deterred by a sticker in a window
7281562 because they already have homophobic and violent tendencies its more likely to be a provocation
7281563 lots of people in the gay and lesbian community fear it will provoke more violence weve had enough of these pr stunts
7281564 what we really need is more police and more security people are too drunk to read stickers anyway

7281639 biden and mccain were among the most frequent guests on don imus radio show often heaping praise on each other
7281640 but people close to the situation say peterson was very instrumental in maines transformation from orioles non prospect to mets rising star
7281641 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen tables like mine you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills
7281642 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7281643 hell have to figure out which of the seven tables to sit at
7281644 you cant change america when youve supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7281645 how can mccain understand the real issues facing the average american when he doesnt even know how many houses he has
7281646 the issue is that mccain isnt even making an effort to understand where we are coming from

7281652 the issue is that mccain isnt even making an effort to understand where we are coming from
7281653 a loud roar above the house that sounded like a missile shortly thereafter we heard an explosion and a tremor my first reaction as a former utility employee was that maybe someone shot a missile into the substation
7281654 did not come over my house i dont know what we heard
7281655 the first thing i thought it was was a missile
7281656 i know of two people i will not mention names that heard a missile they both live very close within a couple of hundred yards this one fellows served in vietnam and he says hes heard them and he heard one that day

7281663 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china
7281664 but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice
7281665 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7281666 beijing got what it wanted out of this globally televised spectacular
7281667 it reaped a huge prestige bonanza that it will surely use to promote its international influence and we fear further tighten its grip at home
7281668 discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise
7281669 what was the goal of bringing the games to beijing
7281670 if they wanted to bring the games to the most populous nation in the world they succeeded
7281671 if they wanted to help the communist party issue propaganda to its own people they succeeded if it was to improve human rights they failed miserably
7281672 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china

7281681 every time a pet trustingly eats another bowl of high sugar pet food he is being brought that much closer to diabetes hypoglycemia overweight nervousness cataracts allergy and death
7281682 it is far too costly to cut off flea collars or unwrap spoiled steaks
7281683 this whole mess is loaded into batch cookers that are fed continuously non stop 24 hours a day seven days a week as meat is melted away from the bones in the hot soup
7281684 millions of americas deceased pets are being cooked and processed into pet food most pet owners dont realize this fact does this raise questions of ethics that should be answered by the veterinary profession and the pet food industry
7281685 consider the introduction of dogs and cats into the human food chain by way of livestock food made from rendered by products what happens to all those toxic products that we use so liberally on our pets
7281686 very few owners would request a complete autopsy of a pet dead from neurological disease
7281687 the fda regulations for animal feed go into effect next month banning the use of meat and bone meal in cattle feed but this does not apply to pet food which means that more of this material will be available for the pet food industry
7281688 we simply will not allow a company to store foods under filthy and unsanitary conditions that occur as a direct result of the companys failure to adequately control and prevent pests in its facility
7281689 consumers expect that such safeguards will be in place not only for human food but for pet food as well
7281690 in recognizing the need for disposal of a large number of unwanted pets in this country cvm has not acted to specifically prohibit the rendering of pets however that is not to say that the practice of using this material in pet food is condoned by cvm
7281691 thousands of dead dogs cats raccoons possums deer foxes snakes and the rest that local animal shelters and roadkill patrols must dispose of each month
7281692 lift them off the truck and heave them into a pit exposing themselves to foul odors putrid substances underfoot and having to see the grinding going on
7281693 this food is healthy and good but some people dont like to see meat meal that contains pets
7281694 yes here is the establishment that now accepts cats and dogs maple leaf inc
7281695 los angeles sends 200 tons of euthanized cats and dogs to west coast rendering every month
7281696 over the years the center for veterinary medicine has received sporadic reports of tolerance to pentobarbital in dogs in 1996 the cvm developed and validated a method to detect pentobarbital in dry dog food and a preliminary survey of 10 samples found low levels in 2 samples cvm had collected 75 representative dry dog food samples and were in the process of analyzing these for pentobarbital levels
7281697 we request you wait until the evaluation process is complete at which time we will send the full results to you
7281698 dogs who received 150 and 500 micrograms of pentobarbital once daily for eight weeks had statistically higher liver weights relative to their body weights than the animals in the control groups increased liver weights are associated with the increased production by the liver of cytochrome p450 enzymes
7281699 a euthanasia solution such as pentobarbital cannot have a withdrawal time and its mechanism of action results in tissue reside so it could not be used to euthanize animals intended for human or animal food
7281700 presently it is assumed that the pentobarbital residues are entering pet foods from euthanized rendered cattle or even horses
7281701 take our word for it no dog and cat dna was detected in the food we tested
7281702 validation of a polymerase chain reaction method for the detection of rendered bovine derived materials in feedstuffs
7281703 summary statements which were the written end product of some oral briefings
7281704 poultry necks and backs and viscera and ground up poultry feathers
7281705 main role with regard to pet foods the registration of therapeutic claims associated with veterinary diets
7281706 member companies only use materials from animal species which are generally accepted in the human food chain
7281707 this rules out the use of any materials from horses ponies whales and other sea mammals kangaroos and many other species the pet food industry only uses materials of beef lamb poultry and pork origin fish shellfish rabbit and game
7281708 the import certification relates to materials specifically allowed in pet food e g low risk materials or in other words that which is fit for but not intended for human consumption
7281709 the french bulldog club of america does have a code of ethics that breeders are expected to abide by but they do not always and the fbdca has no way of enforcing that code of ethics
7281710 never buy a puppy from a place where you wouldnt want to eat dinner or use the bathroom
7281711 hes going to raise your taxes hes not patriotic hes going to be soft on our enemies
7281712 just assume your new digital camera is disposable because guaranteed whatever you pick it will be upgraded or obsolete in the next year in the interim while learning digital youve saved the cost of your camera body in the value of film amp processing alone
7281713 thats how ive invested for the past 20 years and how ill invest for the next 20
7281714 thus any estimate of long term financial success greater than about 80 is meaningless
7281715 there are numerous examples of how the olympic movement can create a powerful impact on the launch of a new global brand
7281716 in the beijing 2008 olympic games the company that continues that tradition is lenovo
7281717 lenovo has directed its hardware service and marketing programs so skillfully at the beijing 2008 olympic games that the ioc believes this sponsorship will have a long term lasting impact on the lenovo brand
7281718 website averaging more than 50 000 visitors a day and transforming the way people connect with the olympic games
7281719 we have worked to be comprehensive creative and cutting edge in our marketing activation

7281787 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7281788 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7281789 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams

7281798 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision

7281807 i thought my sister was making it up i thought she was creating excuses about how hard it was to raise my niece but now i get it now that she lives with me i get it
7281808 its got to be more consistent we had a couple that broke which is good but what i want is a punishment i want to punish a defense i want to take their legs out of them so they cant rush
7281809 we just werent quick enough we were hoping for a few safety cars to come out during the race so ran a one stop strategy but it didnt happen it was a difficult race pace wise and weve got a lot of analysis to do
7281810 i was hit from behind on the first lap i came back and passed a couple of cars but when i tried to pass one of the force indias i aborted the manoeuvre and made contact with them so sorry to them for that that damaged my barge board and the side of the car so after that the balance and downforce were very poor
7281811 a disastrous race david got involved in an incident in the first lap which damaged his car and mark who was on a one stop strategy was hoping for a safety car that never appeared he didnt have enough pace particularly after his pit stop its our most disappointing race of the year congratulations to sebastian vettel who drove very well today and demonstrated what the chassis is capable of
7281812 after qualifying yesterday i knew that me weekend was going to be difficult at the start i was touched by nakajima and i lost my rear wing my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for the supporters who came here this weekend to support me i now want to concentrate on the rest to the season and the next race in spa
7281813 the first lap was rough as i was in the middle of the pack and lost several positions after that i tried to fight back but my front wing was damaged and it was difficult to overtake its a shame that we couldnt get into the top ten but i hope we can have a better race in spa for the belgian grand prix in a couple of weeks time
7281814 its a weekend to forget our objective remains to fight for fourth place in the championship and we must now stay focussed for the races to come and continue with our efforts to grow stronger
7281815 that was a good result and a great performance by the team the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7281816 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
7281817 this has turned into one of those good weekends after qualifying everybody was a bit disappointed but today went much better due to excellent teamwork after jarno missed saturdays practice session the crew put timos set up into jarnos car and he delivered a very good performance and a very smooth race to 5th place today timo was not feeling well but he made an excellent start managed his tyres well and put in a huge effort to complete this race with the best result im very happy that we are confirming our good pace now we will push to keep these results coming with a particular eye on the japanese grand prix later in the season

7281837 it continues to amaze me that corporations like mcdonalds continue to publicly and financially support things that alienate their consumer base shareholders as wells as customers should be outraged at the blatant position this company has taken on this issue

7281942 maybe you should get to know these guys a little and they wont get on you as much
7281943 to get my gear i wound up going to about 30 different companies
7281944 but i want to see how else i can help out
7281945 a silver lining in these scandals is that infidelity is still scandalous this shows that all the efforts to discount bill clintons cheating as just sex didnt change the national perception or even democrats that fidelity matters
7281946 infidelity sexual or financial carries national security risks making a politician vulnerable to blackmail or criminal behavior to cover up his actions but it also betrays a lack of character and good judgment that he is willing to sacrifice everything that matters even people who depend on him for something not nearly as important
7281947 there are two trend lines that would indicate these concerns will not be a factor one the anxiety level in the public is so deep and serious right now that some of the trivial sensational issues are not going to have the impact they had in the past
7281948 the second thing is that its a mistake to think the public only sees imperfection and failings of just the other side both parties have their share of peccadilloes for every eliott spitzer and john edwards theres a larry craig or a mark foley
7281949 there is no reason to take keep x because they have x number of players there keep y is undefended so lets go there and cap it
7281950 the stadium is already a world famous athletics venue and its reputation as a major training facility is growing
7281951 our aim now is to capitalise on what we already have here by developing something really special
7281952 my name long ago such worthless details fell from memory i know only the lust for glorious battle for blood for victory i seek only the eye of tzeentch his favour his grace his dark gifts that through them i may be remade reborn why do we raid your lands why do we burn your homes why do we flay your flesh to serve the lord of change and his magnificent designs
7281953 say what you will of us call us heathens because we deny your weak pretender god call us savages because we strike at you but know this it is we who are closest to the ruinous powers we most favored of the gods shall raid your lands revel in your suffering and destroy you despair for all that remains for you is the taste of northern steel and the end of your world such is the will of the gods
7281954 he is tzeentch the changer of ways the raven god the lord of mutation he is the master of all that changes and the changer of all that remains his will is chaos and all the creatures of chaos are but fleeting thoughts in his vast mind
7281955 let mere wizards have their simple fire the flames of tzeentch are by far the more subtle the stranger and all the more powerful for it who is more deeply burned the man who is scorched and recoils or the man who accepts the flame thinking it is but warming light
7281956 where is your faith on this dark day chaos rides against you will you let these beasts destroy your hearths and homes or will you trust in sigmar and fight forward men and drive back this chaos rabble for the empire for sigmar
7281957 these poor simple folk too fearful or too dull witted to see the vulgarity and evil in their own midst they wail and complain about my uncompromising methods but who among you can say that hanging half a village is too high a price to pay for the assurance that corruption has been exposed and destroyed this day
7281958 there is a fire within you deep in your mind there is a glowing ember which we will fan to life and build into a blazing beacon you will be the empires greatest weapon a pyromancer your fire will incinerate the enemy and purge the unclean do not be late for class
7281959 do not desire the touch of a maibd a bride of khaine for her life is wholly given to the lord of murder and he is a jealous god unwilling to share his chosen ones
7281960 few are the select chosen that survive the reveries of the death night fewer still are those who leave the cauldron with eyes of molten brass burning with the hatred of our dark god these true chosen are taken into the cult and trained in the most secret of rites emerging as masters of death second only to khaine himself
7281961 a sorcereress must walk the dark paths of the realm of chaos the deep pits of the oceans and the bowls of the fiery mountains in her quest for knowledge the channeling of the raw winds of chaos is what gives the sorceress her power the creatures of the chaos hells will bow to her will in the end such power is vast but dangerous and the aspirant to the dark convent of sorceresses must be courageous and strong
7281962 where is your faith on this dark day chaos rides against you will you let these beasts destroy your hearths and homes or will you trust in sigmar and fight forward men and drive back this chaos rabble for the empire for sigmar
7281963 enlightenment is achieved by mastering not only the body but the soul only then can a warrior truly understand the value of life and why it should be protected at all costs
7281964 while lesser races must study magic in its corrupted broken form our mages harness its power as pure mystical energy our minor spells those lores taught to the humans by might teclis are but a pale reflection of the power that can be wielded by an asur fully trained in the magical arts of the white tower
7281965 do not be deceived by the rugged beauty of chrace for behind that serene mask lies a beast like none other no no i speak not of the war lion but of its white lion master whose will can bring such a beast to heel
7281966 sometimes you need a lad who can take a beating and beat back sometimes you need a lad with the tusks to face off against the big nasties
7281967 hes got waaagh and hes not afraid to use it
7281968 toothy ornery and voracious the squig is almost as prickly as its master
7281969 to fight an iron breaker is to fight an anvil you are more likely to re shape your weapon than to move him and heavens forbid one should happen to land on you
7281970 the engineer is the type of guy who brings a gun to a sword fight
7281971 whats lacking in the coverage of the afghans is the sense of the humanity of the afghans
7281972 in the prince harry coverage for example there were all these people out there you never really saw them
7281973 you knew that the bombs were dropping in that direction and the guns pointing in that direction but you never got a sense of how afghans are as a people
7281974 it may sound odd but the humanity of the taliban because the taliban are a wide very diverse group of people
7281975 some of them would like to talk to the british government some of them dont want to be fighting british troops some of them would this is the ideological taliban
7281976 we never have the ability or sometimes the desire to present this in a different way so that people would be interested its a regret
7281977 in a country which is as complex and as difficult and dangerous as afghanistan you cant really cover it properly and get the full picture unless you are there day in day out unless you are living there and feeling and eating the heat and the dust
7281978 what does it feel like to be a british soldier under fire its bloody frightening and difficult and dangerous exhilarating as well
7281979 but we also want to know what it feels like to be an afghan involved with such hopes in 2001 that things would get better and theyve got a lot worse
7281980 its a hard one because with an issue like prince harry it meant that there was a series of decisions taken all along the way journalists were one bit of a very long chain
7281981 if harry went there was no doubt that he was going to put himself and the lives of his commanders at risk
7281982 we are making these deals all the time when gordon brown goes to afghanistan we are not allowed to report perhaps it the deal wont happen again
7281983 it probably did bring a lot of people to think about afghanistan who normally wouldnt ordinarily think about afghanistan if the prince harry story can bring more people to think about afghanistan then thats a good thing
7281984 there was a lost opportunity there was hardly any mention of afghans even of afghanistan just a sense of i went to a country far away
7281985 viewing figures went up prince harry got a heros welcome and recruitment for the british army went up so an objective was achieved did that mean people knew more about why britain was there i dont think so
7281986 journalists focused on the human story but it should part of a wider picture
7281987 the victim believed to be aged 18 years was taken by london ambulance to whipps cross hospital he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival
7281988 we believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed
7281989 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information you may have the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central
7281990 did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre did you see anyone run away from the scene

7281992 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7281993 it was an amazing sight i couldnt believe how they came down its something well never forget
7281994 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
7281995 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
7281996 these people are giving a bad name to their country
7281997 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking

7282001 ele uma grande pessoa posso dizer com seguran a que um cara diferenciado no que se refere a vis o de futebol mas nesse momento infelizmente precis vamos mexer com o grupo tenho certeza de que em breve ele estar treinando um grande clube
7282002 gostaria de pensar que sim durante estes quase cinco anos eu tinha a necessidade de ganhar cada competi o e creio que isso mudar um pouco
7282003 rafa sentir agora o que eu senti por muito tempo ser interessante ver como ele lidar com isso mas at aqui ele tem jogado bem em todas as superf cies e merece a primeira posi o
7282004 talvez eu n o esteja jogando o meu melhor t nis mas j tive partidas lend rias aqui onde as rodadas noturnas s o eletrizantes e o p blico sempre se comportou bem comigo tomara que os torcedores venham me apoiar e me carregar para outra vit ria
7282005 those who were for hillary are either going to be voting on our side or not voting at all
7282006 i think this is going to help us down in the ballot
7282007 my wildest dream was just to play in one olympics to represent my country i thought i was retired after the 96 olympics
7282008 i keep telling her she could get five gold medals
7282009 im still going to nag her about playing in her fifth one and im very persuasive
7282010 thats what really scared me about coming back honestly to play with a younger group
7282011 i was like oh man i hope theyre not about themselves thinking about points and all that and i could not have been more wrong about what these young ladies were about
7282012 it was all about team for every minute every second
7282013 but then the u s had a timeout and put the clapper on us
7282014 i just had that in my head that im going to have four gold medals and im going to put them all on and wear them on the medals stand
7282015 they asked me to put the others up until i received the fourth one first
7282016 so dont come after me for these medals theyre just gold plated
7282017 just to see lisa with it its an inspiration for anyone in the olympics

7282020 it was one message that had to reach any number of devices
7282021 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7282022 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7282023 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7282024 it depends where the tendon inserts into the biceps five or six months is the result if its the tendon we think it is
7282025 we have only made initial inquiries and greg has been too concerned about the girl and said he will come and see me first thing in the morning to tell me more
7282026 it was a reflection of how much the guys gave physically to secure that victory and also that our feet are firmly planted on the ground
7282027 we know that this is a two match tour were very happy with what weve achieved today and rightfully so but another challenge awaits us in seven days
7282028 we are competing for the tri nations it is a seriously tough competition our mindset is to get up for the challenge next week and if we do that then hopefully that might be an opportunity for us to win it a couple of weeks after that
7282029 belief was something i mentioned before the game it always gets tested over here the positive mindset and belief of this team so far is holding us in good stead and building the challenge is to back up next week
7282030 we are pleased but i guess the key now is can we back up there would be many whod suggest we cant and history would suggest that also
7282031 we have a great opportunity to do that this week and thats what well concentrate on
7282032 we have come over here so many times and got so close it has been a constant area of disappointment to finally get the monkey off the back is very satisfying
7282033 great labor and pain in bringing of me up in learning and honesty
7282034 how haps it govenor yesterday my lady princess today but my lady elizabeth
7282035 its ironic but imo i dont believe elizabeth could do whatever she wanted queen or not in many ways particularly in romance she had less freedom than a commoner there was also a double standard at that time as to what a female and male ruler could do im sure elizabeth was judged differently being a queen
7282036 theres no rule that citations are mandatory for the forum or any part of the site for that matter most of the information is simple stuff one can look up on encylopedia websites
7282037 does any one know why elizabeth did not marry and were she died
7282038 on a related note does anyone else think that henrys getting jealous of annes bond with elizabeth
7282039 youd have to say that from a neutral point of view this group has run out of steam and its hard to go back to the well all of the time
7282040 theres guys there that have given everything over the last five and a half years and at the moment other teams are lifting but the group as we know it has been so good and its just not capable of producing the performances that they once were
7282041 we certainly havent given up hope this year if you make the finals you give yourself a chance
7282042 but the question is how do we as a coaching group get the players back up to that level of intensity
7282043 the first 13 weeks of the season we were very good and we were able to play at that level but we have dropped off
7282044 its possible to get it back and thats what we need to discover over the next seven days leading into brisbane
7282045 we have been doing things to try to do that but those arent working so well just continue to keep trying
7282046 i was starting to build some momentum and winning a few races
7282047 it would have been an interesting spring because i had a few nice rides
7282048 captain bax has been racing really well music review was a nice horse heading towards the wyong and newcastle cups as well as the metropolitan
7282049 ive watched the replay but i dont think ill watch it again
7282050 im only young and while ill miss this spring ill bounce back ive done it before and ill do it again
7282051 the way we played was so encouraging the one touch stuff we played the little angles and triangles we created was great
7282052 stevie corica was having fun out there it was fun to watch from the sideline the combination stuff was brilliant and well get better at it because johnny aloisi is a touch player as well
7282053 it is the first real time that we have played together
7282054 the combination was pretty good and obviously we can get better
7282055 it was pleasing i scored two goals its always nice when you score early on in a game
7282056 hes just come into the team second game the pressure is on at 2 2 and he steps up like that and takes a great free kick and wins us the game it was brilliant
7282057 maybe this week we might be hearing from him a little bit after that goal
7282058 other teams have been trying to get in stinks with them and i havent seen it work
7282059 it hasnt worked well for anyone if i told the team to go out there and bash them i might as well just tell them they couldnt win by playing their best football because if you need to stink to win then you dont have confidence in them
7282060 we wont be trying to come up with any trick plays we know we are a chance of making the finals but all that doesnt matter unless you are playing your best football
7282061 i can do the maths but at the end of the day we shouldnt need that as motivation
7282062 you have to be ready for a physical game because they are well coached and they have a heap of internationals
7282063 they just run harder and tackle harder than any other team in the competition
7282064 everyone talks about what they do after the tackle but they plunge into the line pretty hard we just have to be ready for that
7282065 other teams have been trying to get in stinks with them and i haven amp squo t seen it work
7282066 creo que dada la coyuntura hist rica del juicio a fujimori no era lo m s conveniente que una comisi n tan importante como es la de acusaciones constitucionales estuviera en manos de una conspicua representante del fujimorismo es un proceso hist rico el proceso del siglo y obviamente no puedo dejar de expresar el sentir de la mayor a del poder judicial por lo que se est comentando conf o en la calidad profesional del rgano jurisdiccional que tiene a cargo dicho juicio estamos preparados para resistir cualquier tipo de presi n adem s conozco a la se ora moyano tiene sus cualidades y espero que no utilice ning n mecanismo de presi n

7282069 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
7282070 i am pro life and an advocate for the rights of man everywhere in the world because to be denied liberty is an offense to nature and natures creator
7282071 with one more vacancy on the supreme court we could be looking at a majority hostile to a womans fundamental right to choose for the first time since
7282072 i do not support roe v wade it should be over turned
7282073 i personally believe that marriage is between a man and a woman but i also agree with most americans that decisions about marriage should be left to the states as they always have been
7282074 im proud to have led an effort in my home state to change our state constitution and to protect the sanctity of marriage as between a man and woman
7282075 sipper but cold red wine ah the courage i did it

7282087 terrorism is an anxiety inspiring method of repeated violent action employed by semi clandestine individual group or state actors for idiosyncratic criminal or political reasons whereby in contrast to assassination the direct targets of violence are not the main targets the immediate human victims of violence are generally chosen randomly targets of opportunity or selectively representative or symbolic targets from a target population and serve as message generators threat and violence based communication processes between terrorist organization imperilled victims and main targets are used to manipulate the main target audience s turning it into a target of terror a target of demands or a target of attention depending on whether intimidation coercion or propaganda is primarily sought
7282088 the court concludes that the acts committed at srebrenica falling within article ii a and b of the convention were committed with the specific intent to destroy in part the group of the muslims of bosnia and herzegovina as such and accordingly that these were acts of genocide committed by members of the vrs in and around srebrenica from about 13 july 1995

7282122 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
7282123 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
7282124 it might be cheaper to buy you an airline ticket back to taiwan
7282125 ce qui a t fait jusqu pr sent a t bien fait il me semble compte tenu de circonstances tr s difficiles
7282126 ces troubles ne vont pas dispara tre rapidement et il faudra de s rieux efforts pour les surmonter
7282127 why am i still wearing clothes not having sex with this person is not an option
7282128 thats o k ill give jackie the fish head and olive the tail the waitress overheard that and brought the fish already divided that way on three plates
7282129 as soon as shell let you go ill take you to china this is a serious offer
7282130 i rise in opposition to this resolution which is yet another meaningless but provocative condemnation of china it is this kind of jingoism that has led to such a low opinion of the united states abroad
7282131 we are not debating a bill to close guantanamo where abuses have been documented we are not debating a bill to withdraw from iraq where scores of innocents have been killed injured and abused due to our unprovoked attack on that country we are not debating a bill to reverse the odious fisa bill passed recently which will result in extreme abuses of americans by gutting the fourth amendment
7282132 instead of addressing these and scores of other pressing issues over which we do have authority we prefer to spend our time criticizing a foreign government over which we have no authority and foreign domestic problems about which we have very little accurate information
7282133 for years u s policy has been that no meeting or negotiation could take place with iran until certain preconditions are met by iran among these is a demand that iran cease uranium enrichment which iran has the right to do under the terms of the non proliferation treaty it is little wonder why some claim that resolutions like this are hypocritical
7282134 instead of lecturing china where i have no doubt there are problems as there are everywhere i would suggest that we turn our attention to the very real threats in the united states where our civil liberties and human rights are being eroded on a steady basis
7282135 the bible cautions against pointing out the speck in a neighbors eye while ignoring the log in ones own i suggest we contemplate this sound advice before bringing up such ill conceived resolutions in the future
7282136 such a deed itself is blasphemy to the olympic spirit and is against the common wishes of people all around the world including people of the united states
7282137 the patriot act and the real id act are not only unconstitutional but extra constitutional these bills are predicated upon the idea that our government has the power to do such things as spy on its own citizens and this is simply untrue the 4th amendment to the constitution prohibits the federal government from unreasonably searching or seizing the people their property and effects without probable cause the distinction that i have made here is important because it states that not only are these acts of congress unwise but they are unauthorized and beyond the scope of power for congress to authorize
7282138 nonetheless these acts must be negated or otherwise removed from the books as president i will not only push for congressional repeal of the patriot act and real id act i will simply nullify all aspects of these egregious bills as the chief executive it will be within my power to simply not enforce this legislation however presidents will come after me so it will be of paramount importance that we remove these acts from the books barring that i will seek to defund and declaw the agencies who are empowered by such legislation
7282139 as ive already stated i am opposed to the real id act this includes all provisions therein because the act comes as a whole package the border fence should be built in my opinion but it should be voted on very clearly and with no piggy backing provisions a straight up or down vote is what the american people want and it is what they should be afforded congress does of course have the authority to waive laws that it legislated in the past and also has the authority to limit the jurisdiction of the various federal courts which is the second half of section 102 c in the real id act
7282140 the continuity of government ensures that in times of crisis or violence the government will continue to function legitimately or as legitimately as governments can function the real id act seems rather innocuous to those who trust their government and elitist leaders to do the best for the country in the event of a crisis i fear that the real id act would be used to restrict voting or freedom of movement in the event of a crisis
7282141 the real id is a federal intervention into the business of the various states i am a firm believer in the principles of federalism enshrined in our constitution and loved by our founding fathers each state has the power to determine its own credentials for voting or even for employment and this is none of the federal governments business a simple reading of the 10th amendment will tell us that any powers not provided to the federal government in the constitution is reserved to the states or to the people nowhere in the constitution is voting mentioned as a power to control by the federal government simply put my administration would do nothing to manage the fiscal burdens passed to the states by the real id act my administration would cut any enforcement of this legislation off at the knees at an estimated cost of 11 billion over five years americans simply cant afford the real id act more importantly national identification cards are a very unpopular idea and the people will not suffer this violation of their civil liberties to date 21 states have passed legislation rejecting the real id act and i will encourage more of them to follow in their footsteps
7282142 michael phelps is great but you cant take swimming all that seriously

7282154 real concern that either the soviets or the chinese communists or both would go beyond the supply flights and directly intervene in the fighting on 14 december 1960 the nsa director vadm laurence l frost institute a sigint readiness condition bravo on a theaterwide level throughout the far east
7282155 diems luck held the coup leaders were disorganized and amateurish rather than seize the palace where diem and his brother were barricaded they preferred to talk they also failed to capture the radio stations and other communications centers and failed to set up roadblocks
7282156 american sigint had been surprised by the coup as had american intelligence in general
7282157 in the mad scramble for positioning that followed the viet cong in the nam bo saigon region directed subordinate elements to help soldiers officers and others politicians and security personnel involved in the coup to escape
7282158 were the communists on to something there is no doubt that they were correct in their assessment that the americans were disillusioned with diems failure to select a course of social reform and stick with it

7282161 luvdarts are much more than just a mobile video download to the consumer they are digital greeting cards they can send to their family friends and lovers but to a business they are valuable tools in harnessing the power of word of mouth peer2peer advertising
7282162 well its a well known fact that the most effective marketing comes from personal recommendations by family and friends and there have never been greater opportunities for a business to market directly to consumers than the mobile space presents today the problem is how to get directly to the consumer without violating their privacy and rules set forth to protect the consumer by the wireless industry luvdarts get people to spread the word family to family friend to friend lover to lover and we let the businesses subsidize the activity
7282163 its simple we let a business run a campaign whenever they want to drive more traffic to their physical location or website s they can choose the start and end dates their target market daily download budget and incentives we then stock their luvdart downloading store with co branded luvdarts they distribute a code to their customers who can visit that store and download luvdarts free under the terms of that campaign
7282164 oh i get it the business pays for the download later at a wholesale price
7282165 thats right the business only pays for whats been downloaded to be clear there is a setup charge for each campaign
7282166 hmmm very interesting concept i see where people will want to send luvdarts to their family and friends as they also carry a businesses message and promotions without violating their privacy how are you going to get this going with businesses
7282167 thats a great question first we think any business that advertises in the yellow pages will be interested in a luvdarts campaign why the average business is paying a monthly amount for an ad they cant change for 12 months in the yellow pages we give them the ability to run a campaign of different sizes and targets whenever they please for local businesses as well as national that is huge the traffic that will come from a campaign is generated mainly from their existing patrons word of mouth and the business is able to control the times when it may need more traffic driven to its location
7282168 well it seems like youve got a winner here i will be watching your progress
7282169 thanks we luv what we do and weve put a lot into it by the way we will be at the ctia entertainment conference seeking alliances as we are now set to do business with the world will you be there
7282170 criticisms of pat robertson and jerry falwell as agents of intolerance during the 2000 republican primaries

7282172 dispatches from the religious left the future of faith and politics in america
7282173 the fiercely partisan religious right leader rick warren of four years ago is little different from the rick warren of today
7282174 at the civic forum warren featured the key litmus tests of the religious right abortion and same sex marriage while ignoring the so called broader agenda of the supposedly newly moderate evangelicals such as climate change and domestic and world poverty
7282175 warren opened the forum by saying he supports separation of church and state while the event itself held in the sanctuary of a church epitomized the all out war on separation being waged by the religious right and its current avuncular leader mccain and obama have contributed greatly to the role of warren as a power broker reflecting poorly on the judgment of both

7282181 bush administration officials have claimed that they do not fund religious activities but this grant suggests otherwise
7282182 apparently their policy is to do it until they get caught
7282183 tax funds were being funneled to this organization even though it openly boasts about its religious content and theres no evidence its approach even works
7282184 this incident is a perfect example of whats so wrong with faith based initiatives
7282185 this was a clear example of unconstitutional support of religious coercion and discrimination im glad we were able to bring the matter to an appropriate conclusion

7282190 irrelevance is a related and arguably bigger problem for analysts than politicization intelligence analysis rarely impresses itself upon policymakers who are inevitably busy and inundated with more demands on their time and attention than they can possibly meet intelligence officials must draw attention to their product and market their ideas this is especially true in the case of any early warning or intelligence related development that has potentially significant consequences for important interests a phone call a personalized memorandum a meeting any and all are required if the situation is sufficiently serious involving relevant policymakers and other consumers in the regular personnel evaluations of the analysts who serve them would strengthen the importance of such an effort and provide an incentive to individual analysts 2
7282191 the proper relationship between intelligence gathering and policymaking sharply separates the two functions
7282192 fundamental to decision making in regard to any military operation is knowledge of the environment since it enables combatants to optimize the assets they have to target their effort to anticipate developments and husband their force
7282193 one of seven battlefield operating systems intelligence maneuver fire support fs air defense mobility countermobility survivability combat service support css and command and control c2 that enable commanders to build employ direct and sustain combat power
7282194 all these tasks take place within the dimensions of threat political unified action land combat operations information and technology
7282195 we must gauge the character of the enemy government and people and do the same in regard to our own finally we must evaluate the political sympathies of other states and the effect the war may have on them
7282196 one must keep the dominant characteristics of both belligerents in mind
7282197 the problem with most discussion of globalization is that too many experts treat it as a binary outcome either it is great and sweeping the planet or it is horrid and failing humanity everywhere
7282198 show me where globalization is thick with network connectivity financial transactions liberal media flows and collective security and i will show you regions featuring stable governments rising standards of living and more deaths by suicide than murder these parts of the world i call the functioning core or core but show me where globalization is thinning or just plain absent and i will show you regions plagued by politically repressive regimes widespread poverty and disease routine mass murder and most important the chronic conflicts that incubate the next generation of global terrorists these parts of the world i call the non integrating gap or gap
7282199 measure and forecast trends in various military balances such as the maritime balance the northeast asian balance the power projection balance the strategic nuclear balance the sino soviet military balance and the european military balance between nato and the former warsaw pact some of these studies look 20 or 30 years into the future to examine trends and discontinuities in technology economic indicators and other factors
7282200 weapons and force comparisons with efforts to produce judgments about military effectiveness that sometimes
7282201 a major component of any assessment of the adequacy of the strategic balance should be our best approximation of a soviet style assessment of the strategic balance but this must not be the standard u s calculations done with slightly different assumptions rather it should be to the extent possible an assessment structured as the soviet would structure it using those scenarios they see as most likely and their criteria and ways of measuring outcomes the soviet calculations are likely to make different assumptions about scenarios and objectives focus attention upon different variables include both long range and theater forces conventional as well as nuclear and may at the technical assessment level perform different calculations use different measures of effectiveness and perhaps use different assessment processes and methods the result is that soviet assessments may substantially differ from american assessments studies analyzing perceptions are difficult because the data used often must be inferred from public writings and speeches implicit biases of americans based on our own education and culture must also be avoided
7282202 comparing the soviet structure with chinese materials in the 1990s it is apparent from the way in which soviet strategic assessment was performed in the 1930s that a number of similarities at least in institutional roles and the vocabulary of marxism leninism can also be seen in contemporary china
7282203 one of the reasons for this favorable appraisal of global was the growing involvement of the military services and relevant civilian agencies of the federal government in a common forum
7282204 finally this sorting out of the conventional from the game tested wisdom helped the players in the real world after the exercise was over to focus on the pertinent second order issues the games were educational for the intelligence community in learning the sort of information that policymakers needed in a critical situation in understanding the information that needed to be researched even to create a plausible scenario policymakers and senior commanders learned how to use intelligence more effectively and how to make use of the community resources they also provided an opportunity to test new strategies and tactics and sometimes explore the potential of weapons systems under consideration
7282205 andy marshall the director of net assessment in the pentagon and a notable consumer of wargaming has argued that the circumstances facing the united states today in terms of strategic uncertainty are quite similar to those we confronted in the early 1920s the beginning of that interwar period saw the emergence of new technologies with startling potential military applications
7282206 by repeating the games the plan was to conduct comparative analysis as scenarios and adversaries varied over the long term
7282207 instead of a free play two sided game it simply became a scripted exercise
7282208 for the concepts of rapid decisive operations effects based operations or operational net assessment to be properly assessed
7282209 exercise officials denied him the opportunity to use his own tactics and ideas against blue and on several occasions directed red force not to use certain weapons systems against blue it even ordered him to reveal the location of red units
7282210 you dont come to a conclusion beforehand and then work your way to that conclusion you see how the thing plays out
7282211 my main concern was wed see future forces trying to use these things when theyve never been properly grounded in any sort of an experiment
7282212 really very good indeed i check it every day sometimes twice

7282214 the style of writing sets it apart from other blogs
7282215 when you are playing well you feel comfortable on all courts
7282216 in the past when i was playing well i did well on hard courts too i feel good for sure i won two tournaments in toronto and the olympics and i played semi finals in cincinnati
7282217 i think i need the crowd support a little bit this year
7282218 but i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a us open its a tough tournament to win
7282219 i had a tough year and ive been struggling quite a lot
7282220 its tough to expect results but i will try my best
7282221 somehow i started to go out there and started to believe im a player and i can compete with the top players
7282222 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world athletes from 204 national olympic committees came to these dazzling venues and awed us with their talent
7282223 we have to be certain that what we tell the families is the truth
7282224 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7282225 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7282226 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7282227 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7282228 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7282229 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7282230 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7282231 they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
7282232 sie glauben wirklich dass alle unsere schwestern alt verk mmert und tr bselig sind

7282246 en el c rculo de amigos cada uno podr adquirir la energ a de la fe yo no quiero crear ninguna nueva religi n que cada cual se quede en su iglesia o congregaci n religiosa pero lo que escuch all que tambi n lo crea y lo practique yo he venido para todos los seres humanos no importa de qu religi n ni de qu naci n por eso el c rculo de amigos de bruno groening no es una secta
7282247 me es permi tido ayudar a una persona a encontrar el camino hacia el bien pero no puedo quitarle la decisi n ni puedo obligarla a obrar bien cada cual debe encontrar su propio camino
7282248 i definitely want to get something bad on the road big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
7282249 a silver lining in these scandals is that infidelity is still scandalous this shows that all the efforts to discount bill clintons cheating as just sex didnt change the national perception or even democrats that fidelity matters
7282250 infidelity sexual or financial carries national security risks making a politician vulnerable to blackmail or criminal behavior to cover up his actions but it also betrays a lack of character and good judgment that he is willing to sacrifice everything that matters even people who depend on him for something not nearly as important
7282251 there are two trend lines that would indicate these concerns will not be a factor one the anxiety level in the public is so deep and serious right now that some of the trivial sensational issues are not going to have the impact they had in the past

7282256 we have directed our militants to stop attacks against the government and security forces in bajaur from today
7282257 the jirga elders council insisted that taliban should stop fighting in the interest of the people of bajaur
7282258 we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development towards dialogue
7282259 we do not believe in their verbal commitments if they are sincere they should first surrender

7282268 westoxification and secularist tendencies unfortunately infiltrating the managerial body of the country
7282269 some bullying and shameless powers wanted to claim my way or the highway towards the iranian nation but the nation and the very person of the president resisted their demands
7282270 throughout the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7282271 it is clear that china has put the bar very high he said
7282272 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7282273 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose rogge said
7282274 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7282275 who won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7282276 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7282277 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7282278 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever

7282290 we can hardly afford not to make an investment of that sort
7282291 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7282292 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7282293 i think we did a hell of a job of putting america back where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7282294 i think theres only one dream team in my opinion
7282295 theres teams that could be close to it but not like that one that team changed a lot of things in basketball and made a lot of young players want to play basketball and want to dedicate themselves to the sport
7282296 i think this team is really very good and played at a very very high level all tournament and theyre close to that team but now i think theres nothing like that

7282302 que el m ximo jerarca del gobierno amedrent a los magistrados de la corte primera y esa fue la raz n por la que fuimos destituidos
7282303 la destituci n se produjo luego de que ch vez calific a las v ctimas de vendidos a los intereses de la oposici n golpista
7282304 no fuimos juzgados por un tribunal imparcial que nuestra destituci n nunca fue suficientemente justificada que las pruebas que promovimos que demostraban nuestra inocencia nunca fueron tomadas en cuenta y reconoce que el tsj no obr nunca de manera aut noma independiente e imparcial
7282305 sentimos que esta sentencia abre una ventana de esperanza es una luz de justicia que muestra que internamente no conseguimos justicia que ese tsj no est actuando de manera aut noma independiente e imparcial
7282306 el presidente en cada regi n determinar los niveles de consumo por rubro para garantizar un m nimo que no se traduzcan en consumo exagerado
7282307 esa es la mentalidad que esta detr s de las leyes quien decide es el gobierno no el pueblo
7282308 en primer lugar promover la producci n de alimentos en venezuela y dejar de comprar alimentos a otros pa ses en segundo lugar asegurar los derechos de los consumidores a comprar los alimentos que quieran a precios razonables y de buena calidad y en tercer lugar lograr que el gobierno y el sector privado trabajen juntos como socios no como enemigos para lograr as m s alimentos para venezuela

7282312 more than 40 world records were set more than 100 olympic records and of course we had the two icons of the games michael phelps and usain bolt
7282313 ein superstart mit einem sch nen tabellenbild aber wir sind nicht so naiv zu glauben dass das so weitergeht mehr aussagekraft gibt es erst nach zehn spielen

7282317 when we are young we try to realise our ideas without thinking about it but we miss experience on how to do it when we grow older we become sceptical and sometimes dont even try in fact if youre committed nothing can stop a good idea
7282318 i am passionate about the innovation of business itself how we organize ourselves may very well be the key to getting a technology or business to succeed

7282323 he got his dog trained so that it only does it on newspapers the trouble is it does it when hes reading the blasted things
7282324 i havent done it so far because i just havent had time it has become crystal clear to me that unless you want to look like a complete prat you need to dedicate at least four or five days a week to rehearsal
7282325 i am really competitive and while i would not expect to win it i would hate to be the first person to be kicked out
7282326 it is the only reality tv that i would cheerfully consider doing with the exception of strictly you immediately surrender all free will
7282327 you are manipulated and controlled if anyone is going to make a prat out of me it is going to be me i want to do strictly and i want to do it well
7282328 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7282329 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7282330 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down
7282331 wir sind entschlossen wirksame ma nahmen gegen solche seiten vorzunehmen
7282332 ein schnelleres und effektiveres mittel zur abschreckung gegen solche rechtswidrigen vorg nge
7282333 es gibt jedoch keinen grund flugg ste die eine regul re flugbuchung und damit einen wirksamen flugbef rderungsvertrag abgeschlossen haben am flughafen stehen zu lassen
7282334 wer zusatzkosten und sch den wie zum beispiel kosten f r ersatztickets und umbuchungen und hotel bernachtungen aus einem nicht durchgef hrten bef rderungsvertrag erleidet kann diese gegen ber seinem vertragspartner einfordern
7282335 china ist ein rechtsstaat so steht es jedenfalls in der verfassung das ioc ist machtlos
7282336 china hat die welt besser kennengelernt und die welt hat china besser kennengelernt
7282337 die spiele hatten zwei ikonen michael phelps und usain bolt
7282338 ich gebe keinen kommentar ab zum leistungssprung das m ssen experten tun
7282339 aber sie m ssen bedenken dass es in dem monat vor peking 39 f lle gab
7282340 wir haben das ungew hnlich gefunden und es gab gespr che mit dem bocog dar ber
7282341 die situation war nicht perfekt aber sie hat sich sicherlich verbessert im vergleich zu vorher
7282342 wir sind nur eine sportorganisation wir k nnen keine ver nderungen erzwingen
7282343 wir k nnen einer souver nen regierung nicht reinreden wir m ssen das chinesische rechtssystem respektieren

7282346 we have to keep a close eye on the situation
7282347 its too soon to speculate what the widespread effect will be but regardless we still have ample airlift into and out of new york city
7282348 the difference is huge if you have to fly through dallas or chicago
7282349 you start to ask yourself if the size of the client relationship justifies the emotional and financial cost of the trip
7282350 if its mostly seniors flying to florida expecting 200 fares those flights are going to get cut

7282355 unter dem deckmantel der multi kulti gleichmacherei wollen die gr nen die kirchen aus dem ffentlichen leben verbannen das gab es schon in der ddr

7282365 but be honest if you had your way you wouldnt have the roll call
7282366 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghanis who we are committed to protect
7282367 these reports are being investigated in afghanistan and well look for the results of that investigation
7282368 coalition forces take precautions to prevent the loss of civilians unlike the taliban and militants who target civilians and place civilians in harms way
7282369 in the tragic air strike and irresponsible and imprecise military operation in azizabad village in shindand district more than 89 of our innocent countrymen including women and children were martyred
7282370 aware of allegations that the engagement in the shindad district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian casualties
7282371 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7282372 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here
7282373 as we celebrate the success of these games let us together wish the best for the talented athletes who will soon participate in the paralympic games they also inspire us
7282374 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitors from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7282375 and now in accordance with tradition i declare the games of the 29th olympiad closed and i call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the 30th olympiad
7282376 were not in really a self sustaining economic posture to be doing all the things that im trying to do without augmenting my income in ways that are available
7282377 but to have as a slave i will sell him for three
7282378 there were at times behind closed doors and even at practice when we were trying to develop a game that hugh and the staff believed that would some day turn us into olympic champions
7282379 and obviously this is the culmination of it but its all the days behind closed doors and all the work you really put in that no one else besides the team and staff
7282380 they deserved the victory im glad a great group of people won the gold medal so great persons and great professionals so i think the gold is in good hands we fought we tried hard they were better they deserved it and we must learn from those who beat us and try to be stronger the next time
7282381 on one hand i mourn the loss of my father in law greatly and my heart aches for my wife and for our family for the loss
7282382 and on the other hand of course i am extremely proud and happy for my team and for usa volleyball as an organization and for the thing that weve been able to achieve
7282383 tanto per cominciare si dovrebbe iniziare morendo e cos tricchete tracchete il trauma bello che superato quindi ti svegli in un letto di ospedale e apprezzi il fatto che vai migliorando giorno dopo giorno

7282398 the bankruptcy bill is morally bankrupt and so is any senator who votes for it
7282399 so what does the bill do it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses

7282428 if i get punched very rarely have you seen me not hit back hard
7282429 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7282430 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7282431 if i get punched very rarely have you seen me not hit back hard
7282432 lets take an oath on the koran this time that i will fulfil all my promises
7282433 i dont want to swear on the holy koran for political objectives but i would expect that all promises would be fulfilled
7282434 political parties do not make promises they only arrive at understandings
7282435 ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage
7282436 the war that began in georgia is no longer about that country alone
7282437 the outcome there will determine whether we realise the grand ambition of a europe that is whole free and at peace
7282438 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7282439 i see them as people who are ideologically not worlds apart
7282440 and i would be honoured to run with or against john mccain
7282441 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead
7282442 i would be honoured to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7282443 joe biden has a long record of experience its in sharp contrast to barack obamas record we feel like its a bit of a disguise pick hes trying to disguise hes the most inexperienced candidate in the modern era
7282444 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7282445 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7282446 republicans are going to be ready willing and eager to run against him
7282447 theres a smirk on our faces because there is plenty to work with
7282448 voters are smart enough to forgive the genuine flaws of genuine people
7282449 and over the long haul biden provides what obama needs
7282450 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university
7282451 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family to be able to get to university
7282452 there are only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11

7282454 australia welcomes foreign investment but only where it meets australias national interests
7282455 more carefully consider proposals by consumers to control existing producing firms
7282456 we need to ensure that investment is consistent with australias aim of ensuring that decisions continue to be driven by commercial considerations and that australia remains a reliable supplier in the future to all current and potential trading partners
7282457 no apologies for thoroughly assessing applications of this nature to ensure they are in australias national interests
7282458 i have determined that the undertakings agreed with chinalco are acceptable for protecting the national interest in this matter
7282459 treasurers statement reflected the normal firb process and that the miner had noted chinalcos undertakings
7282460 the gap between telstra market will close over time if pay increases are policy based
7282461 it shows that as a result of the collective agreement that telstras average pay is the best in the industry but the company wants to reduce the gap by offering smaller wage increases
7282462 it shows primarily the aim of the game is to reduce labour costs and that means people are going to have a reduction in their take home pay and their conditions of employment
7282463 telstra is a real live example of the need for a proper collective bargaining regime to be in place telstra has been prepared to flout the decision of the australian people last year thats why we need the legislation in place as quickly as possible so we at least ensure telstra is required to bargain in good faith they havent done that
7282464 we have always said we will protect those for existing employees thats exactly what well do
7282465 obviously there are a large number of groups seeking a meeting with the prime minister
7282466 since the budget representatives of seniors australia have met with ministers and their representatives on more than half a dozen occasions
7282467 on top of these meetings in late july the government appointed michael oneil the ceo of seniors australia to the pension review reference group which is assisting the harmer review into retirement incomes the prime minister fully supports national seniors development of a 2020 policy document which is why technical assistance with the paper was offered by treasury an offer taken up by seniors australia
7282468 why the son of a bitch looks like a senator
7282469 his legs bore out the striking and agreeable proportions of his body his lightness on his feet his erectness his easy bearing added to the impression of physical grace and virility his voice was noticeably resonant masculine warm
7282470 its helpful to point out that barack obama is not the messiah his national security adviser richard danzig told
7282471 theres a tendency to see him in messianic terms he cannot multiply loaves and fishes
7282472 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on earth
7282473 since well before john kerry was demonised for knowing how to speak french it has been axiomatic that heartland americans dont like foreigners piping up about our elections however much brainland americans may disagree
7282474 single coherent structure with a common pool of resources delivering family law services at the appropriate level
7282475 it is important that any changes which might be made that the current culture of the fmc is maintained
7282476 i think both courts are now looking forward to a thorough consideration of how the system can best operate for the benefit of the litigants and a hopeful end to the resourcing tensions inherent in the existing arrangements
7282477 i must tell you frankly ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party
7282478 ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7282479 the wrong emissions trading policy framework could be disastrous for the economic prosperity of this state and the country

7282500 there are numerous examples of how the olympic movement can create a powerful impact on the launch of a new global brand
7282501 in the beijing 2008 olympic games the company that continues that tradition is lenovo
7282502 lenovo has directed its hardware service and marketing programs so skillfully at the beijing 2008 olympic games that the ioc believes this sponsorship will have a long term lasting impact on the lenovo brand

7282510 is not so much whether st marys should be closed down but whether st marys will close itself down by practices that separate it from communion with the roman catholic church
7282511 in reality st marys south brisbane has taken a roman catholic parish and established its own brand of religion
7282512 undoubtedly it does good it promotes a strong sense of community opens its doors to all who wish to come but its own style of worship and sacramental practice can hardly be described as roman catholic
7282513 im not particularly hopeful myself but its up to the community they will find the right solution
7282514 it is generally regarded in the gaming machine business that that sort of hand out from the government a fair whack of it finds its way into the pokies
7282515 thats what happens when people who have a gambling problem find themselves with extra money then almost certainly theyll put that money into the pokies
7282516 the harsh reality is that those who are hooked on the machines often spend their bonuses on the machines only to regret it later
7282517 where are you going to get money from and how would you going to live

7282524 they make it look very easy but we all know they work very hard to create the best playing surface in minor league baseball and it is great to see that get recognized again this season
7282525 throughout the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7282526 it is clear that china has put the bar very high he said
7282527 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7282528 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose rogge said
7282529 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7282530 they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone

7282568 everyone wants to talk about nba players as arrogant as selfish
7282569 we all complain on our teams that i want to play with this player or that one
7282570 well here weve got them all this is how its supposed to be
7282571 a lot of people doubted that nba stars could play together
7282572 right after the olympics are over our mindset is already focused on the next four years and what we can do to change how we prepare and try some new things and thats something im looking forward to now
7282573 i still have things that i want to do in the sport ive never competed over here in london and im looking forward to really experiencing more of the city and be able to prepare myself to hopefully swim some fast times
7282574 ive no idea what im really going to do but im looking forward to trying some new events and swimming some events that i havent really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7282575 ive never really swum the backstroke or the 100m freestyle at a major international competition so bob bowman my coach is going to throw everything he has ever done coaching me out of the door and try something completely different just to see how it works open water at least those guys will still be my friends
7282576 im excited for the next four years and today is the kick off for the next four years
7282577 we are just trying a bunch of new things and if its successful then great and if not then we can go back to what we were doing
7282578 but im looking forward to having some changes because the last 10 or 15 years have been the same thing the whole time
7282579 ive got some pretty lofty dreams in my head and those goals are going to stay there until they are accomplished
7282580 this has been one of the hardest things ive ever done to be able to swim 17 times and make sure that i have to be ready to swim at my beat in every one of those races because im competing against people who are focusing just on that one race
7282581 i know that its not going to be easy getting there and there are going to be some bumps in the road here and there but everybody has bumps in the road and it really just depends on how you get over those and make sure it doesnt happen again
7282582 i dont think its going to be perfect but its going to be fun over the next few years while i finish off my career
7282583 i told myself i would never compete past the age of 30
7282584 i started swimming when i was seven and i told my coach im not swimming past the age of 30 so dont get any ideas
7282585 he said thats good because i dont want to coach you past the age of 30
7282586 every city has had its big twist on the games what they have thats different to every other county
7282587 the olympic movement is about bringing the world together im not sure what that difference will be but im looking forward to seeing what it is and how this city develops
7282588 we will draw on our wit flair imagination and ingenuity to build on what weve all witnessed in beijing and deliver a fantabulous olympics in what i consider to be not only my home but the home of sport
7282589 the next summer games return to a country which i frequently boast has either invented or codified just about every major world sport
7282590 es un paso m s en el reconocimiento p blico
7282591 el cari o el apoyo y el acompa amiento que nos han dado desde que asesinaron a mi padre
7282592 estos meses han sido muy duros al principio nos vimos envueltos en el desconcierto y la desesperaci n el asesinato de mi padre es un golpe cruel que ha marcado nuestras vidas para siempre y del que dif cilmente podremos recuperarnos alg n d a solamente aprender a vivir con ello
7282593 qu ha logrado eta asesinando a mi padre por qu decidi eta ejecutar a mi padre
7282594 exigimos que los asesinos de mi padre los que le marcaron con una diana los que organizaron su asesinato y los que empu aron y dispararon los cinco fatales disparos as como los que los han amparado sean detenidos juzgados y encarcelados
7282595 el vasco es un pueblo pac fico ansioso de que llegue la paz y la libertad y con vocaci n de di logo
7282596 es muy importante porque recordar es revivir porque recordar es hacerles poderosos en nuestra memoria porque la memoria de lo que han sufrido las v ctimas del terrorismo y su ejemplo vital jam s puede desaparecer

7282601 sch n und was kann ich f r sie tun
7282602 unsere bibliothek ist sehr erfolgreich und jetzt soll etwas unerwartetes passieren
7282603 muss ich sofort kommen ich kann den intercity von 3 uhr am hauptbahnhof erwischen dann bin ich kurz vor 5 in hinterkappelen
7282604 wunderbar unsere bibliothek wird n mlich 20 jahre alt das wollen wir feiern zu gerne h tte ich eine lesung mit roger graf und michael schacht organisiert doch ich kann die beiden die uns jeden sonntag im radio mit ihren kriminalgeschichten erfreuen einfach nicht finden da habe ich gedacht das ist ein fall f r maloney
7282605 they are separated for the moment but are working on it
7282606 we are in the process of resolving the matter amicably
7282607 i loved the washington bureau i just hope he doesnt destroy it
7282608 it was the first time ive been upset with obama in a long time because he woke me up
7282609 i got up and spent a lot of time on the computer and i could have spent that time sleeping
7282610 i had the phone under my pillow waiting for the text
7282611 my feeling is that they had to speed things up by a few hours once it started to leak around midnight that it was biden
7282612 they were ready to go but probably would have preferred to do it a little later
7282613 my first reaction when i read the text was what in the world is obama doing sending out a text in the middle of the night
7282614 we are aware of the logon problems but we have no comment at the moment
7282615 some in beijing did download and i think thats what spooked the chinese government
7282616 this is not to justify the wrong practices and weaknesses of some members of media but to enable us to understand better the situation if we understand it fully then we would know how to respond if ethics is the only problem then our focus would be to only respond to ethics however because we see the problem as connected to the economic problems then we address as well the economic problems

7282621 he does it in training every day its something hes used to as soon as he got on the ball we knew he can produce the magic from there hes got the winner again today and were delighted

7282645 nothing in the universe can stop a joyful woman overflowing with confidence and sens
7282646 he did ask directors marco branca and lele oriali for him yes
7282647 the lad would certainly be useful for our style of play but mourinho knows full well that we cannot sign quaresma until we sell someone else
7282648 we have never put too much pressure on porto and there is a problem of price that has to be considered too
7282649 mourinho knows that right now the priority is to reduce the size of the squad so he can work on the field the way he wants to
7282650 nothing in the universe can stop a joyful woman overflowing with confidence and sens
7282651 the situation in the league table is pretty but we are clever enough and not so naive to think that this will be a permanent reflection of the reality
7282652 we did not play as well in the first half as we actually can do
7282653 nothing in the universe can stop a joyful woman overflowing with confidence and sens
7282654 well we dont think so we thought we deserved something out of that for sure its not often you play against a chelsea team and apart from the goal which is a wonder strike from deco after that they havent really done much against us
7282655 as a team weve worked our socks off to try and contain them and who knows with a little bit of luck maybe if kapos shot had gone in the corner in the last couple of minutes wed have capped off a good display from us because i think we deserved something out of the game
7282656 thats two games in a row now weve been one down after three minutes
7282657 with a little bit more luck we could have got something out of the game
7282658 i think weve strengthened the proof is there for everyone to see
7282659 nothing in the universe can stop a joyful woman overflowing with confidence and sens
7282660 you could tell how much our winner meant to the fans the roof came off when my goal went in
7282661 everyone knows that these are the games we have to win if we are going to mount a serious title challenge too many home points were squandered last season
7282662 maybe our fans were thinking of what happened last season when we drew too many games at home
7282663 but this time we have sent out a message that we can produce results like this
7282664 last season we had some bad home results but this time around we have tried very hard to be positive and to make sure such things do not happen again this win shows we can do it
7282665 ive had problems with my groin throughout pre season and things have not gone the way i wanted them to
7282666 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
7282667 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
7282668 i am not at my best at the moment but i hope the fans will be patient because i am only three weeks away from my best form and fitness
7282669 we are looking for another striker to compensate the departure of andy johnson and we think moteb would be the best option
7282670 the player could join the team before the end of transfer window and only moteb has the right to choose where he wants to go
7282671 i need to buy top players to challenge the top teams and that costs big money
7282672 im going to try to do something but i cant say for sure it is going to happen
7282673 disappointing traumatic frustrating and it was all caused by the referees first half performance which affected the end result
7282674 i thought his first half performance was abysmal we thought we should have had a free kick for their first goal keiren westwood has concussion and a dislocated finger following the collision
7282675 then i thought it was a penalty on clinton morrison if he doesnt get pulled back then he is going to put the ball in the back of the net we dont get the penalty i lose my temper and he sends me off fair enough maybe i deserve that for my reaction
7282676 but it wasnt just one decision that had been coming and it was decision after decision the players did well to hold their temper because they were frustrated too i didnt but i will take whatever the sanction is against me
7282677 but what happens to him after that first half performance phil dowd is a referee i have had before and he has had some very good matches but not this one

7282680 i think the united nations can bring an added value
7282681 we represent many relief agencies in different sectors different clusters like shelter sanitation food protection and i am sure the united nations can bring more specific assistance and can complement the efforts of the international red cross and red crescent organization in order to address the needs of the population
7282682 in tshkinvali the capital the regional capital from the reports we had 80 percent of the city has been damaged
7282683 there is a need for food and water and i think we should be able to support the effort of the icrc to support the authorities to bring more assistance to the people who are in need of this assistance

7282727 in a brilliant new documentary an american filmmaker traces the lives hopes and aspirations of black teenagers during their matric year it is a heartbreaking story and nobody who watches this hour long film will ever again interpret the matric results with the unrestrained exuberance to which we are treated every year testing hope has touched a raw nerve in our post 1994 democracy what drives many to action upon seeing this film is that we realize in a very vivid way how high the stakes are for poor students and the dramatic consequences of failure for individuals families and ultimately society as a whole this movie is activism in its purest form

7282787 wahai rasulullah saya lupa sehingga makan dan minum padahal saya sedang berpuasa
7282788 sempurnakan puasamu dan kamu tidak wajib mengqadhanya sesungguhnya allah telah memberimu makan dan minum
7282789 aku juga pernah mendapati shubuh dalam keadaan junub lantas aku berpuasa
7282790 demi allah sungguh aku berharap agar aku menjadi orang yang paling takut kepada allah dan paling tahu akan sesuatu yang bisa dijadikan alat bertakwa

7282798 orang yang makan di siang hari bulan ramadhan atau minum harus diberi pelajaran dengan hnkuman supaya jera
7282799 semua aroma yang tercium oleh orang yang sedang menunaikan ibadah puasa tidak membatalkan puasanya kecuali bau rokok jika ia menciumnya dengan sengaja maka batallah puasanya tetapi jika asap rokok masuk ke hidungnya tanpa disengaja tidak membatalkan sebab amat sulit untuk menghindarinya wallahu alam

7282832 true heroism is remarkably sober very undramatic it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost but the urge to serve others at whatever cost
7282833 if heaven is about to entrust an important mission to a man it begins by filling his heart with bitterness and by confusing his powers of perception and overturning his plans it forces him to exert his bone and muscle it forces him to endure hunger and all manner of sufferings when the man emerges triumphantly over all these trials and tribulations he is then capable of accomplishing what would have been impossible for him to do before
7282834 it is clear that the europeans are launching a negative campaign against islam and the muslims despite their requests for inter religious dialogue and respect for the other person

7282845 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7282846 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7282847 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7282848 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7282976 i think it was not very clever from his side
7282977 even if you go out in front of me he needs to let me by its a shame to fight with him in the pit lane
7282978 ive had a traumatic weekend with a few health problems and the team has helped me he massa was in front and its pretty difficult to overtake so i had a certain gap and tried to maintain it its hot and you do not have enough water in the car its like driving in a sauna im pretty happy with the way i got through it
7282979 we have time to work and so many important races in front of us im so happy especially after such a disaster in hungary
7282980 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7282981 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7282982 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7282983 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7282984 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7282985 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7282986 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7282987 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7282988 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7282989 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7282990 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7282991 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7282992 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7282993 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7282994 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7282995 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7282996 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7282997 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7282998 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7282999 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7283000 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick does anybody really think that they didnt get what we had because they didnt have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment of course not it was because there was no platform upon which they could stand
7283001 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand
7283002 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7283003 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7283004 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7283005 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7283006 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7283007 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7283008 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7283009 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7283010 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales

7283027 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7283028 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7283029 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7283030 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7283031 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7283032 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7283033 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7283034 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7283035 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

7283037 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7283038 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7283044 half a century of conflagration wars and struggle in egypt palestine lebanon north africa iraq and the persian gulf
7283045 forty 50 60 years of bloodshed and tanks of wars and resistance of destroyed buildings and lost ideals of weeping and wailing of the murdered and the displaced
7283046 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7283047 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7283048 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7283049 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7283050 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7283051 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7283052 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7283053 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7283054 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7283055 i obviously had scored i dont know if they werent watching or what
7283056 thats one of the things i hate about this sport
7283057 if theyre taking steps unilaterally then what we can do it looks like the peoples party wants to break ties with us
7283058 its time to keep the coalition intact as the country is facing serious threats of growing militancy and a worsening economy we have decided to support mr zardari
7283059 but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7283060 stray incidents of attack on prayer houses were reported from some places
7283061 soren will take an oath as the chief minister of jharkhand and i will ensure it
7283062 if they are taking steps unilaterally then what can we do it looks like the ppp wants to break ties with us
7283063 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7283064 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7283065 its a tradition from the indian sub continent to prepare a fresh paan in front of the customer according to their requirements
7283066 if shopkeepers are not allowed to do that they will suffer a lot of smaller businesses are not aware of the consultation
7283067 there is a 500 acre low lying land near the project site where the ancillary units can come up and the government can decide on it if the government agrees we will show it to them
7283068 that is an old proposition that will not solve the problem
7283069 dont even look at walls of the tata motors factory we believe in peoples movement no agitation can be launched by demolishing walls if anybody try to demolish walls we will not have anything to do with them

7283072 she doesnt know yet that she has been married added jtili of the girl who is about to begin her fourth year at primary school
7283073 as the decision has been taken by all the members of the icc we welcome it we are not disappointed
7283074 we were backing pakistan but considering the situation we agree with the member boards but we continue to support pakistan
7283075 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7283076 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7283077 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7283078 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7283079 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7283080 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7283081 i am looking forward to trying some new events some events ive never really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7283082 the all consuming work of inventing or developing a product and getting it to market efficiently and successfully of solving problems of figuring out the issues and expectations these are all great cultural levellers
7283083 you cannot presume what a person can do or will do based on a job title
7283084 they can be damned hard on suppliers vendors and partners who dont deliver at the level they want or who dont come through with the level of breakthrough inventiveness or creativity they seek
7283085 flexibility is a special type of genius whether americans push on to 99 999 per cent quality or put a fork in it and serve it up at 80 per cent solved their ability to make this decision in near real time has worked well so far
7283086 the germans are so good at anything they do they are loath to change course the french who are very hard workers labour for a higher god who doesnt seem to care if they have a plan or not and for the japanese the plan has been so well conceived it practically is a god
7283087 indian it professionals in general perhaps because of their advanced technical educations might tend to analyse a problem from four different angles while americans will look at it from just three angles and then run out the door and start selling it
7283088 if a face and a voice can help spread the message then im more than happy to be that face and voice
7283089 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7283090 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7283091 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7283092 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7283093 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7283094 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7283095 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7283096 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7283097 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

7283100 the islamic people want to kill us thats their principle and belief relations between palestinian christians and muslims have deteriorated in the
7283101 islam the worlds fastest growing religion preaches tolerance non violence and respect for human life
7283102 educated on replacement theology in which god was done with israel and jews they were in turn supportive of the palestinian cause to liberate all palestine
7283103 and if its not the members of hamas or islamic jihad
7283104 the systematic persecution of christian arabs living in palestinian areas is being met with nearly total silence by the international community human rights activists the media and ngos
7283105 christian leaders are being forced to abandon their followers to the forces of radical islam
7283106 a christian man is weak compared to a muslim man
7283107 they have bigger more powerful families and they know people high up in the palestinian authority
7283108 i want to leave but nobody will buy my business
7283109 the political situation in lebanon and the instability of politics in palestine has affected tourism and pilgrimage
7283110 hotels restaurants and souvenir shops are owned by mostly christians so it affects them badly
7283111 we have 65 per cent unemployment and about 2 000 bedrooms in hotels that are empty
7283112 i would rather have a beautiful dream in my head about what my home is like not the nightmare of the reality
7283113 then they forced us to convert to islam at gunpoint
7283114 every day we hear of another christian family that has immigrated to the us canada or latin america
7283115 that 15 years from now there will be no christians left in bethlehem then you will need a torch to find a christian here
7283116 its all of us together fighting our guts out to win a game
7283117 ela ganhou milh es de votos mas n o est na chapa dele obama por qu por falar a verdade
7283118 a verdade d i e obama n o gosta disso
7283119 quem entre n s ser capaz de assumir o poder e encerrar a guerra do iraque quem entre n s sabe o que fazer sobre o paquist o quem de n s vai pegar o telefone e ligar para putin vladimir presidente russo e dizer para ele sair da ge rgia porque saakashvili mikhail presidente georgiano est em apuros
7283120 the two icons of the games were michael phelps and usain bolt
7283121 its important that our teams do well because so many kids get their start in sports on a team
7283122 when a subject becomes totally obsolete we make it a required course
7283123 wenn die ppp einseitige schritte unternimmt was sollen wir dann tun es scheint so als wenn die ppp ihre beziehungen zu uns abbrechen will
7283124 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7283125 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7283126 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7283127 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7283128 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7283129 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7283130 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7283131 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7283132 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7283133 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7283134 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7283135 die welt hat china besser kennengelernt und china hat die welt besser kennengelernt
7283136 aber da hat auch das olympische komitee wohl eher auf die finanziellen eink nfte geguckt als auf das was an mehrwert an demokratie zu erreichen gewesen w re
7283137 wir sind entt uscht dar ber dass china die gelegenheit der olympischen spiele nicht genutzt hat um gr ere toleranz und offenheit zu demonstrieren
7283138 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7283139 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7283140 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7283141 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7283142 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7283143 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7283144 wir haben den ersten mainstream afroamerikaner der redegewandt gescheit sauber und gutaussehend ist
7283145 man kann amerika nicht ndern wenn man immer george w bushs politik unterst tzt hat
7283146 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7283147 the fact that weve never been recognised and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
7283148 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7283149 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7283150 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7283151 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7283152 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7283153 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7283154 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7283155 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7283156 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7283157 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7283158 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7283159 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7283160 der goldene triumph des britischen teams kann nur als inspiration f r jene dienen die in den n chsten vier jahren die londoner spiele zu einem leuchtenden beispiel olympischen erfolges machen werden
7283161 das mehr und mehr leute in der welt erreichen wird
7283162 they have a good squad and good organisation they are athletic and they have power
7283163 hes a very good player but he is a player of real madrid
7283164 apart from the goal which was a wonder strike from deco after that they havent really done that much against us
7283165 you can see why deco has played at the highest level he has that little bit of extra quality
7283166 deco once again with a bit of magic i think thats whats going to help us win the league this year
7283167 i dont think it was as good as last week against portsmouth
7283168 for us today it was just about stopping them and getting three points
7283169 im here firstly for the experience and i will certainly get that if i play regularly in matches like this and travel with the team
7283170 it is what i need really i couldnt get that much at arsenal so i am happy to be here and happy to know im going to get more games than at arsenal
7283171 i dont remember too much about that game except old trafford but i know it was tough that day they were a lot stronger
7283172 niko is out with his ankle but ive still got some good wide players and i wouldnt hesitate to put traore in
7283173 the kid can play and he can certainly run and were looking for a bit of pace
7283174 the only way well have a chance against united is to match their work rate we didnt do that at chelsea and got hammered 4 0 but if we work harder now we can cause united problems
7283175 i had sunderland manchester city newcastle stoke hull and west ham all interested in me its great to know that interest was there
7283176 at first i wanted to stay in london but i prefer portsmouth to west ham because they are the fa cup winners they are in europe and i know people here
7283177 i know i have to improve and i know i can but i need the chance to do my best which the fans havent seen yet
7283178 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7283179 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7283180 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7283181 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7283182 we pride ourselves on our cleanliness security and great atmosphere
7283183 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7283184 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7283185 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7283186 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7283187 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7283188 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7283189 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7283190 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7283191 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7283192 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7283193 amerikaan lepelt 6 6 l diesel in een buick grand national
7283194 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7283195 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7283196 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7283197 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7283198 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7283199 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7283200 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7283201 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7283202 its marvelous indeed beijing leaves an unforgettable memory to the world
7283203 i dont know why im not supposed to win this event
7283204 it just really surprised me i didnt think my finger was shaking i guess it was
7283205 again leading and being very close to gold he took his rifle put his hand on the trigger and for some reason the trigger went off

7283208 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7283209 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7283210 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7283211 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7283212 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7283213 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7283214 all these athletes have to do is taper off for a short period of time before they set foot into the olympic village and they will test negative and they know that
7283215 i still believe that the use of performance enhancing drugs at the elite level of sport professional as well as olympic is rampant
7283216 the spate of doping cases and investigations in the lead up to the games and the commitment of the ioc to protect the integrity of its event are just some indications that the worldwide fight against doping in sport has made a significant leap forward
7283217 its not an accident that these athletes are coming from countries that do not have an independent anti doping federation in place
7283218 maybe they are very rarely tested during the off season october to december but its surely not adequate
7283219 i would say that those athletes are tested comparatively to countries in any country with a national anti doping organization nado or often more
7283220 this is because of the emphasis the iaaf places in testing in non nado countries
7283221 well be doing in competition testing out of competition testing and target testing
7283222 i cant exactly say how often i cant put a number on it
7283223 subjected to adequate off season testing it would make the results more believable
7283224 perhaps theyre making gains because at last the playing field is level
7283225 theres no systematic doping program like there was in the east germany era there are no cheats from the united states such as marion jones
7283226 perhaps that means that the smaller countries that would otherwise be overwhelmed in terms of finance are able to perform
7283227 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7283228 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7283229 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7283230 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7283231 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7283232 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7283233 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7283234 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7283235 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7283236 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7283237 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7283238 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7283239 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba

7283241 democrat rick boucher the districts longtime representative in congress believes obama must capture at least 45 percent of his districts vote if he is to become the first democratic presidential candidate to win virginia since 1964
7283242 when residents of such a predominantly white area say they cant vote for a muslim could that be another way perhaps a more acceptable way of saying they cant vote for a black
7283243 as much as i wish that i could not say this the realistic part of me agrees that yes muslim is to some degree a code word
7283244 there is a very ironic fear of the other the different which is ironic because mountain people have long been perceived nationally as one of the great american others so you would think that mountain people would be very careful not to other other people including obama he said but at a very deep set level there is culturally a fear to venture into the unknown
7283245 you have a deep set conservatism and a deep set liberalism co existing simultaneously you have a region that has rebelled against american political and economic ideologies and a region that has probably the most deeply felt sense of patriotism than any other place in the nation
7283246 if part of this plan fuels inflation a way must be found to prevent this or control any negative aspects
7283247 blocking dangerous trends of western intoxication and secularism which were infiltrating the countrys administration
7283248 but the current governments characteristics mean it has warmer support
7283249 denying its positive aspects and highlighting weaknesses and constantly speaking against it is sabotage not criticism

7283255 it is more important and more special than any championship that any of us will ever win
7283256 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7283257 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7283275 i wanted to give myself time to heal so that when i got out there again id be ready to give whoever i am with the respect and attention she deserves
7283276 i am ready i am ready and open to giving these girls everything i can to find the one that is right for me all i am missing really is someone to share my life with

7283280 i thought of making it the newspaper report into a film but may be making it into a way that its like a fable with morals and things like that but unlike moral it has a lot of surprises but basically its about a journey of a boy who goes to find his donkey back and through his journey he meet all these interesting characters and its a very big tussle for the boy to go and get his donkey back so during this event there are so many things that happen
7283281 i promise and i want to be clear about this i promise to serve you with the utmost integrity
7283282 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7283284 throughout the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7283285 it is clear that china has put the bar very high he said
7283286 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7283287 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose rogge said

7283301 i was excited when i went to the sydney and athens games i cant say that this time
7283302 i dont know what i should think about a country where people cant speak freely
7283303 als ich zu den spielen nach sydney und athen gefahren bin habe ich mich darauf gefreut das kann ich jetzt nicht sagen ich wei nicht was ich von einem land halten soll in dem sich seine b rger nicht frei u ern d rfen uns sportlern sind vom internationalen olympischen komitee politische u erungen vor ort untersagt auch eine art menschenrechte zu beschneiden
7283304 but with the london games in 2012 it would be crazy to go this is the greatest job in the world
7283305 theyd say you cant do anything more with the british team
7283306 if we continue with that passion drive commitment togetherness well be ok
7283307 we dont say that anymore after what they did to us
7283308 did we go to them to fight no they came to us they used to be our neighbors now they are foreigners

7283310 the democrats are starting to struggle in a presidential race which they should be dominating america is beset by economic troubles mired in an unpopular foreign war and facing an unpopular republican party a stunning 80 per cent of americans think that the country is heading in the wrong direction yet obama and mccain are virtually tied in the polls the possible explanations are multiple the democratic campaign is being daily assaulted by withering republican attack ads at the same time there are still deep scars in the party left by the ferocious battle between obama and senator hillary clinton and then there is the issue of race
7283311 i expressed this wish he the owner of the car agreed
7283312 the bread must be wheaten only and recently made so that there is no danger of corruption
7283313 for example people who suffer coeliac disease are unable to absorb gluten a protein found in wheat eating even small amounts of wheat can make them ill
7283314 in recent decades it has been possible to extract the gluten from wheaten bread so that people can eat bread without endangering their health despite the fact that gluten wheat poses a health threat which can often be serious the congregation of the doctrine of the faith stated in a reply in 1982 that the local ordinary could not permit a priest to consecrate special gluten free hosts for the communion of coeliacs
7283315 god in his infinite wisdom and compassion gave loads of people a medical condition that means they cant eat wheat and then required them to eat wheat every sunday
7283316 what no eye has seen nor ear heard nor the heart of man imagined what god has prepared for those who love him
7283317 it is a tremendous honour to be appointed captain of any side particularly one that is packed with quality experienced players
7283318 so understandably im delighted to be invited to continue as ospreys captain
7283319 personally i believe that my first year in the role went well and the edf energy cup win stands out as an obvious highlight
7283320 but im sensible enough to know that i can continue to improve as captain and will be constantly looking to do so
7283321 within the ospreys camp we have a number of leaders each of whom has an input on a daily basis their support makes the role of captain that much easier
7283322 in no way did i get the indication that he might be ready to sell
7283323 i think the reason i was invited down was to make sure i could understand his feelings about things and where he saw the club going now
7283324 i now have a better awareness of where we are at and im comfortable with that i know the investment in the club will continue
7283325 theres a lot of stuff flying around that doesnt really involve football so i can understand the speculation but the reality is i was very encouraged by dr thaksins enthusiasm for the season ahead
7283326 the heart he shows the quality of his game is there and he knows his position on the pitch
7283327 what we are seeing is someone who is expending too much energy in the wrong way if wayne is prepared to listen to us well stop it
7283328 although we accept he has that selfless nature we still want him to be regarded as a goalscorer
7283329 if we are not winning the game and its not happening i get frustrated i like to win
7283330 i dont like losing so if youre telling me thats wrong then i wont believe it im a team player i am not concerned about being selfish
7283331 everyone is talking about me scoring more goals but we won the premier league and champions league last season so if that happens again id be delighted
7283332 i will feel the burden because with the forwards we have like carlos tevez who likes to drop in and thats his best position it would mean i would have to stay further forward
7283333 there has been a lot of talk about us bringing in another forward and hopefully we could do that to strengthen the team and that would help us spread things out
7283334 maybe we could change things for certain games but if a forward doesnt come in then i am sure we can deal with that
7283335 i dont know if i will have to score more well have to wait and see
7283336 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
7283337 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
7283338 i have decided to raise no objections under australias foreign investment policy
7283339 this will underpin the rio share price and also create uncertainty about whether or not bhp will get its deal over the line
7283340 even if chinalco doesnt increase its stake it shows they have the capacity to block the deal
7283341 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7283342 chinalco will have to reapply to increase its stake beyond the level approved and has agreed not to seek representation on rios board mr swan said
7283343 it could do a soft deal with bhp and vote for the merger in return for securing the assets
7283344 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
7283345 because there are no ends there are only means life carries one from unknown to unknown each moment is filled with this thrilling mystery one does not know where he came from or where he is going but he is not here by chance and he is overjoyed by surprises and excited by landscapes that he had never seen before he feels afraid but that is normal if he things only of the goal he will not be able to pay attention to the signs along the way if he concentrates only on one question he will miss the answers that are there beside him

7283366 the kosovo albanians have played us like a stradivarius we have subsidized and indirectly supported their violent campaign for an ethnically pure and independent kosovo we have never blamed them for being the perpetrators of the violence in the early 90s and we continue to portray them as the designated victim today in spite of evidence to the contrary when they achieve independence with the help of our tax dollars combined with those of bin laden and al qaeda just consider the message of encouragement this sends to other terrorist supported independence movements around the world
7283367 other than be our ally in two world wars what have the serbian people ever done to you that you should show such animosity towards them and why would you senator biden and your ilk want to create another terrorist state in the heart of europe

7283369 nursing is like the teaching profession you are always teaching and you know what it empowers people when you share some of your knowledge and your skills you hope it makes it a little better for somebody and thats where im coming from thats why i enjoy volunteering

7283371 you learn so many things and i learned a lot about myself traveling by myself and you learn that basically people all around the world are the same they smile the same they sing the same and they bleed red its so easy for me to see beyond whats outside and really appreciate the person from the inside

7283467 but then why didnt you stay out longer and catch more
7283468 but what do you do with the rest of your time
7283469 i sleep late fish a little play with my children and take a siesta with my wife in the evenings i go into the village to see my friends play guitar sing a few songs i have a full life
7283470 i have an mba from iim a and i can help you you should start by fishing longer every day you can then sell the extra fish you catch with the extra revenue you can buy a bigger boat
7283471 with the extra money the larger boat will bring you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers instead of selling your fish to a middle man you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant you can then leave this little village and move to panjim or even mumbai from there you can direct your huge new enterprise
7283472 afterwards well my friend thats when it gets really interesting
7283473 when your business gets really big you can start selling stocks and make millions
7283474 after that youll be able to retire live in a tiny village near the coast sleep late play with your children catch a few fish take a siesta with your wife and spend your evenings doing what you like with your buddies
7283475 with all due respect sir but thats exactly what i am doing now so whats the point wasting 25 years
7283476 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
7283477 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year the fonz in bronze
7283478 hey there hows everything going in that tax office of yours
7283479 its going ok johnny a little busy lately dealing with extended tax returns how are you today
7283480 oh im not bad im laid off right now so im just keeping myself occupied here and there youre not buying those bananas here are you theyre on sale at the big ge grocery store
7283481 well i didnt know that maybe ill just buy a small bunch here and then ill get more at the big ge when i stop there tomorrow
7283482 yeah thats a good idea sometimes its good to wait before you do something just like i should have waited to file my tax returns i filed them in a big hurry so i could get the rebate and then i got a form afterwards with the amount of unemployment that i earned when i looked at that form i told myself haste makes waste johnny boy you should have taken your time and thought things through and you would have realized you didnt have all your information anyway im not sure what to do about the fact that i left that off of my returns i wonder what i should do but im just not sure
7283483 well johnny you should really file an amended return to correct your mistake because you didnt claim all of your income if you dont file an amended return you will in all probability receive a notice sometime in the future when the irs computer systems match up the documents with the returns then they will charge you not only the tax due on the income but in all likelihood also a penalty and interest you should file an amended return if youre filing status your income your deductions or your credits were incorrect this of course applies in both the case where you owe more tax or if you are due a larger refund
7283484 well gee wiz i didnt leave it off of the return on purpose so i guess that means that i should pay the tax when i file the return
7283485 that would be your best choice if you file the amended return without the tax payment you will ultimately get a notice with the tax due as well as the penalty and interest youll get a notice either way afterwards to charge you the penalty and interest but the longer the tax remains unpaid the larger these numbers will get
7283486 you can get a form 1040x online at www irs gov and prepare it according to the instructions if you owe tax because of the corrections you should try to send it with the return to minimize penalties and interest if the irs owes you money its important that you file your amended return within 3 years from the date of your original return or within 2 years from the date you paid the tax whichever is later and johnny be sure to review your state and local returns to see if you need to amend them as well
7283487 well gee wiz now that i know what to do about this situation i guess i better do that as soon as i can its a good thing i ran into you today and we started talking its always nice to talk to the good folks in this community youve sure been helpful thanks i owe you a favor so ill return it right now by telling you that those cookies youre looking at are also on sale for half that price at the big ge
7283488 well johnny ill just hold off on buying them until tomorrow then and head over to the check out now since weve actually walked up and down every aisle in the grocery store while we chatted its been nice chatting with you you have a good day now johnny
7283489 its been real nice talking to you too you have yourself a good day too

7283536 judges in at least five states have stopped foreclosure proceedings because the banks that pool mortgages into securities and the companies that collect monthly payments havent been able to prove they own the mortgages federal district judge christopher boyko dismissed 14 foreclosure cases in cleveland in november due to the inability of the trustee and the servicer to prove ownership of the mortgages
7283537 its difficult for us to go where our clan doesnt live we cant

7283544 hi ive been told to come and try on a madonna corset
7283545 ich habe versucht mich weiter zu besch ftigen und die gespr che die ich mit verschiedenen teams gef hrt habe waren ganz gut
7283546 es ist f r mich ein spannender abschnitt des jahres weil ich momentan keine rennen fahre erlaubt mir das mit verschiedenen teams innerhalb und au erhalb der formel 1 in kontakt zu treten w hrend andere fahrer ihr saisongesch ft abarbeiten m ssen es war gut f r mich zu reflektieren was am anfang des jahres so passiert ist
7283547 ich habe das gef hl dass ich meine leistungen in der f1 erhobenen hauptes betrachten kann und ich sehe das an den leuten mit denen ich so zu tun habe ich werde jetzt als renn und testfahrer respektiert mehr noch als ich noch nur testfahrer vor meiner super aguri zeit war ich f hle mich voller energie egal was ich tue und ich denke dass in meiner karriere als fahrer ein weiteres wichtiges kapitel vor mir liegt ich bin darauf sehr gespannt
7283548 ich kann da nicht allzu sehr ins detail gehen ich habe nat rlich mit den teams gesprochen wo ich eine chance haben k nnte n chstes jahr an den start zu gehen und es gab immer ein positives feedback das war sehr vielversprechend
7283549 ich hoffe dass ich in der f1 bleiben kann wenn das nicht klappt habe ich au erhalb der f1 noch immer genug andere m glichkeiten und ich wei dass es neben der formel 1 noch ein anderes leben gibt
7283550 wir hatten darauf gehofft dass es w hrend des rennens ein paar safety car phasen gibt wir fuhren aus diesem grund eine ein boxenstopp strategie aber so kam es nicht in bezug auf die geschwindigkeit war es ein schwieriges rennen und wir haben eine menge zu analysieren
7283551 ich k mpfte mich zur ck und berholte ein paar autos aber als ich versuchte einen der force indias zu berholen brach ich das man ver ab und ber hrte das auto entschuldigung daf r dies besch digte mein bargeboard und die seite des autos danach war die balance und der abtrieb sehr schlecht
7283552 david war in der ersten runde in einen zwischenfall verwickelt der sein auto besch digte mark der auf einer ein boxenstopp strategie unterwegs war hoffte auf ein safety car das nie kam er hatte keine ausreichende geschwindigkeit besonders nach seinem boxenstopp dies ist unser entt uschendstes rennen des jahres gratulation an sebastian vettel der heute sehr gut fuhr und demonstrierte zu was das chassis in der lage ist
7283553 nach dem qualifying hatten wir nicht wirklich eine m glichkeit auf chancen zu bauen wir sind aus diesem grund dort ins ziel gekommen wo wir uns qualifiziert haben wir hatten ein schlechtes rennen und m ssen nun einfach arbeiten
7283554 wir hatten einen sehr guten start aber in einer kurve fuhr ich ber den randstein und lewis kam mir nahe als wir auf die zweite kurve zu fuhren aber ich sah dass felipe fr h bremste und es war zu viel risiko wenn ich in der kurve zu schnell gewesen w re dann w re ich in ihn hinein gekracht aus diesem grund entschied ich mich dort zu bleiben wo ich bin
7283555 der schl ssel zu diesem ergebnis war jedoch das qualifying nur drei zehntelsekunden von der pole position entfernt zu sein ist bemerkenswert das ist unsere wahre geschwindigkeit wir sind etwas weit weg aber wir versuchen nach wie vor unser bestes
7283556 ich sah dass eine plastikt te herum flog konnte ihr jedoch nicht ausweichen sie flog unter das auto und pl tzlich konnte ich zwei kurven lang nicht mehr lenken das war extrem gef hrlich und so etwas hatte ich noch nie zuvor erlebt
7283557 als ich in einer der schnellen kurven fuhr flog die t te davon aber um meine zuversicht war es geschehen ich verlor rund drei sekunden beim boxenstopp nahmen sie sie weg wir wussten nicht wann kovalainen an die box kommen w rde aus diesem grund musste ich einen vorsprung heraus fahren
7283558 i will go back to the real world to my day job and find a career for the next 18 months
7283559 i will be young enough and i really want to compete in a home olympics
7283560 het treurig is dat een kleine kern waavoor de eigen belangen voorop staan deze afdeling kapot maken
7283561 mein start war ziemlich gut aber in kurve eins bin ich ber den randstein gefahren und lewis hamilton hat mir die t r zugemacht
7283562 in der zweiten kurve wollte ich ihn berholen sah dann aber felipe massa sehr fr h bremsen es w re zu risikoreich gewesen den bremspunkt zu berfahren und ihn eventuell zu rammen w hrend der folgenden runden war ich stets etwas langsamer als lewis
7283563 pl tzlich sah ich eine plastikt te herumfliegen ich konnte nicht ausweichen und sie hat sich unter dem auto festgeklemmt in zwei kurven konnte ich kaum lenken das war extrem gef hrlich zum gl ck ist der gr te teil der t te bald weggeflogen aber mein vertrauen ins fahrverhalten war erst mal sehr reduziert ich habe rund drei sekunden verloren letztlich kam ich als dritter ins ziel und ich denke dass ich den grundstein daf r gestern mit meinem qualifyingergebnis gelegt habe
7283564 es ist eine katastrophe mit einem auto auf platz neun zu landen das offensichtlich gut genug f r platz drei ist nach dem qualifying war ich recht zuversichtlich man hat ja gesehen dass es geht aber eben nicht immer mit den h rteren reifen in den ersten beiden stints hatte ich gro e probleme mit den weichen am schluss ging es besser ich habe nach dem start einen platz verloren und hatte sp ter keine chance positionen gutzumachen der speed hat gefehlt
7283565 zun chst einmal ein riesenkompliment an die organisatoren und veranstalter zu einer gelungenen premiere
7283566 das ambiente hier in der stadt und auf dem kurs rund um den hafen ist phantastisch valencia geh rt ab sofort zu den h hepunkten der saison nat rlich ist es f r uns sch n wieder zur ck auf dem podium zu sein
7283567 f r robert ist es bereits das f nfte mal in der laufenden saison er ist ein starkes rennen gefahren in den ersten runden hatte er probleme als sich eine herumfliegende plastikt te am auto verfangen und das handling beeinflusst hat abgesehen davon liefen beide autos st rungsfrei auch die boxenstopps haben einwandfrei funktioniert
7283568 als achter hatte nick keine gute ausgangsposition wir hatten gehofft dass er beim start einen oder zwei pl tze gut machen w rde leider ist er im gedr nge jedoch um einen rang zur ck gefallen damit war f r ihn das rennen gelaufen
7283569 das war ein rennen ohne allzu gro e aufreger den spannendsten moment gab es f r uns zu beginn als robert ber funk meldete dass er ein problem habe wir konnten an den telemetrie daten ablesen dass sein auto deutlich abtrieb verlor das r hrte von einer plastikt te her die am unterboden hing beim ersten boxenstopp konnten wir diese dann entfernen danach war wieder alles in ordnung
7283570 beim start h tte robert es beinahe geschafft lewis hamilton zu berholen doch es hat nicht ganz gereicht danach fuhr er ein konstantes gutes rennen das ihm letztlich den dritten platz einbrachte nick war vom achten startplatz aus losgefahren demzufolge hatten wir erwartet dass er wm punkte holen k nnte aber sein tempo war ganz einfach zu langsam nat rlich freuen wir uns ber den dritten platz von robert aber insgesamt hatten wir auf eine bessere punkteausbeute f r das team gehofft
7283571 michael wie gut tut dieser sieg dem team nachdem in ungarn der motor von felipe so knapp vor dem ziel hochgegangen ist
7283572 uns ist ein gro er stein vom herzen gefallen dass es heute so gut geklappt hat f r felipe der schon in ungarn einzigartig gefahren ist er hat das hier fortgef hrt mit einer brillanten vorstellung die man nicht besser machen kann ungarn war schade aber hier hat zum gl ck alles bis ins ziel gehalten
7283573 seine leistung war ein bisschen im stil des supersprinters usain bolt bei den olympischen spielen nicht wahr
7283574 er hat heute etwas wirklich einzigartiges abgeliefert denn diese konstanz und diese pr zision haben das was er in ungarn gezeigt hat noch einmal getoppt hut ab
7283575 zweimal hatte ferrari pech bei den boxenstopps einmal bei felipe und einmal bei kimi kannst du schildern was da passiert ist
7283576 nein aber ich gehe davon aus dass das andere leute viel besser kommentieren k nnen als ich
7283577 war mit dieser ampelanlage die ferrari hat alles in ordnung
7283578 wei t du schon wie es dem mechaniker geht den kimi umgefahren hat
7283579 ihm geht es soweit gut er hat sich keine schweren verletzungen zugezogen er hat sich wohl den fu umgeschlagen es ist den umst nden entsprechend glimpflich ausgegangen
7283580 du kennst solche situationen ja auch aus fahrersicht und jetzt auch vom kommandostand kriegst du da auch einen riesenschreck wenn so etwas passiert
7283581 ja logisch erst mal macht man sich sorgen um die mechaniker die am boden liegen und verletzt sind man wei ja nicht sofort wie schwer die verletzung ist umso sch ner ist es dann wenn man h rt dass es ihm den umst nden entsprechend gut geht
7283582 erwartest du wegen des zwischenfalls zwischen felipe und adrian sutil beim zweiten boxenstopp eine strafe
7283583 ich gehe nicht davon aus dass etwas passieren wird weil keiner behindert wurde
7283584 felipe scheint bei ferrari der schnellere mann als kimi zu sein auch heute wieder was macht er im moment besser
7283585 ihr habt so gute fachleute im hintergrund die k nnen das mit sicherheit besser analysieren als ich
7283586 was hast du nun f r ein gef hl hinsichtlich der weltmeisterschaft es geht in die endphase und felipe ist eigentlich ganz gut unterwegs
7283587 das ist richtig aber es sind noch sechs rennen zu fahren das ist noch ein langer weg f r beide fahrer mal abwarten
7283588 das wochenende begann schlecht f r mich aber es endete gut ich bin zufrieden ich konnte ein starkes rennen fahren ohne zu sehr attackieren zu m ssen ich habe hart angegriffen wenn ich das musste habe dabei aber auf reifen und bremsen geachtet das zeigt wie gut wir uns entwickeln und wie sch n es ist mit einem konkurrenzf higen auto an jedem wochenende zu fahren toyota ist in diesem jahr gut und wir sind auf jedem kurs noch konkurrenzf higer die entwicklung im team geht weiter ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir die form in den kommenden rennen halten und noch mehr punkte holen k nnen
7283589 das war eines der schwierigsten rennen f r mich denn die letzten beiden tage war ich stark erk ltet
7283590 doch ich hatte ein gutes auto und die richtige strategie platz sieben war das beste was wir erreichen konnten ich bin zufrieden ich konnte beim start einige pl tze gutmachen danach fuhr ich einfach mein rennen gegen rennmitte war es schwer die letzten 10 runden gab ich alles um konzentriert zu bleiben wenn man unser qualifying und meine beschaffenheit in betracht zieht dann bin zufrieden
7283591 nach dem qualifying waren alle etwas entt uscht aber heute lief es mit perfektem teamwork viel besser nachdem jarno das freie training am samstag verpasste baute seine crew das auto auf timos setup um damit hat er eine gute leistung gezeigt und fuhr sauber auf platz f nf
7283592 timo f hlte sich auch heute nicht gut aber er hatte einen exzellenten start teilte sich die reifen gut ein und zeigte eine tolle leistung das rennen mit einem guten ergebnis zu beenden
7283593 ich bin sehr zufrieden dass wir unsere gute pace best tigen konnten wir werden nun weiter diese ergebnisse anstreben speziell beim japan grand prix
7283594 tror du fobien skyldes at du selv oprindeligt kommer fra et g og derfor f ler en forbindelse til fugle som du ikke nsker at v re ved

7283597 ik lijd aan het syndroom van asperger een autistische stoornis hierdoor ben ik licht verstandelijke gehandicapt ik was op school al erg langzaam en heb veel begeleiding nodig ik ben altijd veel gepest maar heb wel mijn vmbo diploma behaald het is mij niet gelukt om een vaste baan te vinden
7283598 in no way did i get the indication that he might be ready to sell
7283599 i think the reason i was invited down was to make sure i could understand his feelings about things and where he saw the club going now
7283600 i now have a better awareness of where we are at and im comfortable with that i know the investment in the club will continue
7283601 theres a lot of stuff flying around that doesnt really involve football so i can understand the speculation but the reality is i was very encouraged by dr thaksins enthusiasm for the season ahead
7283602 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
7283603 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
7283604 it is a tremendous honour to be appointed captain of any side particularly one that is packed with quality experienced players
7283605 so understandably im delighted to be invited to continue as ospreys captain
7283606 personally i believe that my first year in the role went well and the edf energy cup win stands out as an obvious highlight
7283607 but im sensible enough to know that i can continue to improve as captain and will be constantly looking to do so
7283608 within the ospreys camp we have a number of leaders each of whom has an input on a daily basis their support makes the role of captain that much easier
7283609 the heart he shows the quality of his game is there and he knows his position on the pitch
7283610 what we are seeing is someone who is expending too much energy in the wrong way if wayne is prepared to listen to us well stop it
7283611 although we accept he has that selfless nature we still want him to be regarded as a goalscorer
7283612 if we are not winning the game and its not happening i get frustrated i like to win
7283613 i dont like losing so if youre telling me thats wrong then i wont believe it im a team player i am not concerned about being selfish
7283614 everyone is talking about me scoring more goals but we won the premier league and champions league last season so if that happens again id be delighted
7283615 i will feel the burden because with the forwards we have like carlos tevez who likes to drop in and thats his best position it would mean i would have to stay further forward
7283616 there has been a lot of talk about us bringing in another forward and hopefully we could do that to strengthen the team and that would help us spread things out
7283617 maybe we could change things for certain games but if a forward doesnt come in then i am sure we can deal with that
7283618 i dont know if i will have to score more well have to wait and see
7283619 i have always been drawn to different kinds of stories and i have also always been a bond fan so it is very exciting to take on this challenge
7283620 the new direction that the bond character has taken offers a director a host of new possibilities and i look forward to working with daniel craig barbara broccoli and michael wilson as well as the team at sony and mgm on this new film
7283621 om echt goed te worden ben je toch wel zes dagen in de week bezig

7283635 de media hebben dit bericht gebruikt om te berichten dat georganiseerd voetbal kijken tijdens het wk verboden is maar dit is niet het geval vng heeft aangegeven dat voor bewust georganiseerde openbaar toegankelijke vormen van publiek vermaak een evenementenvergunning nodig is
7283636 een paar buurmannen die met een pilsje een wedstrijd voor de deur bekijken vallen daarbuiten zodra echter een complete straat meedoet is er sprake van een evenement
7283637 groepen die buiten de kring van vrienden en familie om voetbalwedstrijden gaan bekijken zijn feitelijk met een evenement bezig dus formeel dienen die rechten te betalen
7283638 maar het is een grijs gebied want het is moeilijk aan te tonen wie vriend of familie is
7283639 een gevoel van geraakt zijn dat weet ik niet maar dat zou ook slecht zijn en dat zou ook niet moeten als je leider bent van een kabinet en als je in een leidende positie staat dan krijg je per definitie kritiek en die kritiek die moet je toetsen op hun waarde en daar moet je iets mee doen die moet je niet alleen maar naast je neerleggen en daar zit hij kennelijk mee ik vind dat hij te spastisch reageert en te verkrampt van ik sta pal voor
7283640 het zijn moeilijke jaren geweest dat moet je wel eens je nek uitsteken dan moet je wel eens tegen de stroom ingaan en niet alles wordt in dank afgenomen het is mijn vaste overtuiging dat het werk wat de afgelopen jaren is verricht dat het zo noodzakelijk is er is hoop
7283641 het is te makkelijk om te denken stil maar wacht maar alles komt goed
7283642 als regeringsbeleid dat is dat je eerst om wat voor redenen dan ook eerst gaat knijpen en het blijkbaar zo kunt programmeren zodat er tegen de volgende tweede kamer verkiezingen er wat lucht komt nou dan weet ik niet of dat wel regeren is zeg maar vanuit een visie van de bijbel
7283643 maar ze zijn vooral bezorgd over het cda hun cda dat de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen
7283644 die club is van mij de minima iemand met een uitkering en die is niet alleen van de heren aan de top en de dames die zelf een goed inkomen hebben en die vanuit hun mooie woning kijken naar de maatschappij
7283645 critici over de koers van het cda zoals ronald van bruchem total shot van bruchem staand in de tuin voor zijn woning voorzitter van de jongeren van het cda
7283646 arend jansen namens de minima van de cda basisgroep sociale zekerheid
7283647 en dick corporaal oud cda burgemeester en bestuurslid en voorzitter van de protestants christelijke ouderenbond
7283648 als je zegt een zorgverzekeringsstelsel moet veranderen en dat moest veranderen geen twijfel mogelijk en je zegt niemand zal er op achteruit gaan en je moet als ouderenorganisaties constateren dat gepensioneerden plotseling veel meer moeten gaan betalen niet alleen minder krijgen maar ook meer moeten gaan betalen omdat premies van gepensioneerden niet meer door werkgevers en pensioenfondsen worden betaald ook niet door de overheid dan is er iets mis
7283649 we zijn altijd een volksbeweging geweest dat betekend iedereen hoort erbij met een laag inkomen en met een hoog inkomen nu zie je eigenlijk voor het eerst dat we bijna helemaal in de hogere inkomens zitten we zullen er alles aan moeten doen om mensen met een kleinere inkomen terug te winnen
7283650 als ik naar mijzelf kijk en ook naar mijn lotgenoten dan hebben wij nog altijd moeite met al die koopkrachtplaatjes die koopkrachtplaatjes geven soms volgens ons niet de situatie goed weer gemiddeld iemand zoals ik gemiddeld heeft toch de laatste de twwe drie jaar om en nabij de 53 54 euro ingeleverd
7283651 hoe nu verder met het cda balkenende is duidelijk gewoon doorgaan en dan komt het vanzelf wel goed maar daar zijn de vertegenwoordigers van close up van een pratende balkenende achter lamellen jongeren ouderen en minima het totaal niet mee eens de hervormingen moeten tenminste een tandje minder
7283652 het gaat erom dat men erkent van we hebben een te zware wissel getrokken op die samenleving we hebben die samenleving geprobeerd dingen op te leggen die niet te accepteren waren die polariserend werkten in die samenleving en de het vertrouwen en het geloof in het parlement en in de regering met name te kort deden en die erkenning zou ik willen hebben
7283653 nou we kunnen niet zeggen omdat we een slechte nederlaag hebben gehad we gaan dat hele zorgstelsel opeens afschaffen nee we moeten zeggen dat als er ouderen zijn die heel hard worden getroffen door dit zorgstelsel wat we van tevoren niet wisten en ook niet wilden erkennen en als dat nu wel zo is dan moeten we dat gewoon gaan aanpassen en geld bijlappen
7283654 het wrange is dat de ouderenbondvoorzitter de cda al voor de verkiezingen gewaarschuwd had dat de mensen het tempo van de veranderingen niet meer kunnen bijbenen
7283655 onze boodschap was van goed dat u bezig bent om veranderingen te bewerkstelligen maar pas op dat u het doet op een manier die acceptabel is voor mensen en die mensen ook mee kunnen maken want het gaat er in de samenleving niet om of je gelijk hebt maar of je gelijk krijgt en of je voldoende draagvlak weet te cre ren om wijzigingen in de samenleving te weeg te brengen en dat is veronachtzaam men heeft te veel vanuit de ivoren toren naar die samenleving gekeken en men was bezeten van dit is onze boodschap dit gaan we doen en dit niet
7283656 de club van uitkeringsgerechtigden binnen het cda heeft regelmatig overleg met de fractie maar pas na de verkiezingen belde minister de geus van sociale zaken om te horen wat ze eigenlijk vinden toen heb ik tegen hem gezegd dat de minima nou maar eens een keer in de hele breedte omhoog moet en dat er koopkracht verbetering moet komen omdat het al die maatregelen ik zal ze niet bij name noemen bij mekander een 7 of 8 een veelste grote aanslag plegen op het inkomen van de minima
7283657 hij zei tegen ons dat hij daar over na zou denken en dat hij dat zou overwegen alleen wat ik wel vind is dat daar gemeenteraadsverkiezing voor nodig zijn om daar blijkbaar de top van het cda daar toe aan te zetten
7283658 het blijft tobben in het cda met de drieslags bijbel het programma van uitgangspunten en het beleid in de praktijk zeker als dat beleid neoliberale trekjes vertoont met alle hardheid van dien
7283659 daar komt nog bij de het beleid van minister verdonk volgens de cdaers ook wel wat minder
7283660 terug naar het beleid van balkenende close up van het brein van balkenende staat hij er open voor wat denken zijn critici
7283661 bij deze is hij van harte uitgenodigd om eens een dag met de cda te discussi ren over wat wij meemaken aan de onderkant van de maatschappij

7283670 how important are money management and finances in marriage and family affairs
7283671 the american bar association has indicated that 89 percent of all divorces can be traced to quarrels and accusations over money others have estimated that 75 percent of all divorces result from clashes over finances some professional counselors indicate that four out of five families are strapped with serious money problems may i at this time hasten to emphasize the fact that these marriage tragedies are not caused simply by lack of money but rather by the mismanagement of personal finances a prospective wife could well concern herself not with the amount her husband to be can earn in a month but rather with how he and she will manage the money that comes into their hands money management should take precedence over money productivity a prospective husband who is engaged to a sweetheart who has everything would do well to take yet another look and see if she has money management sense in the home money management between husband and wife should be on a partnership basis with both parties having a voice in decision and policy making when children come along and reach the age of accountability they too should be involved in money concerns on a limited partnership basis peace contentment love and security in the home are not possible when financial anxieties and bickerings prevail whether we are anticipating marriage or are well into it today is the time for all of us to review and repent as necessary to improve our money management skills and live within our means

7283682 christian leaders are being forced to abandon their followers to the forces of radical islam
7283683 a christian man is weak compared to a muslim man
7283684 they have bigger more powerful families and they know people high up in the palestinian authority
7283685 i want to leave but nobody will buy my business
7283686 the political situation in lebanon and the instability of politics in palestine has affected tourism and pilgrimage
7283687 hotels restaurants and souvenir shops are owned by mostly christians so it affects them badly
7283688 we have 65 per cent unemployment and about 2 000 bedrooms in hotels that are empty
7283689 i would rather have a beautiful dream in my head about what my home is like not the nightmare of the reality
7283690 then they forced us to convert to islam at gunpoint
7283691 every day we hear of another christian family that has immigrated to the us canada or latin america
7283692 that 15 years from now there will be no christians left in bethlehem then you will need a torch to find a christian here

7283716 i think i have still got a lot of potential and i have more to give to the sport so thats what is driving me right now
7283717 i want to think about next year and the year after and then reassess everything after every major meet like i have been doing for the past six years
7283718 definitely worlds definitely commonwealth games if i go two years its like you may as well go another two years but to actually think of the four year concept its too hard to commit to that
7283719 for me right now to digest four years is very difficult and i think if i was thinking only about four years time i probably wouldnt keep swimming i will give myself two years and then another two years hopefully
7283720 its been an amazing rollercoaster ride thats for sure she said
7283721 i think thats just reflective of it being the olympics i guess i dont think anything has really fully sunk in yet i dont think that will really happen till we get home and i can see my family and my friends and just see the effect that the olympics has on the australian public
7283722 being a competitive spirit there is always going to be thoughts of how can i do things better next time thats been the case with this
7283723 in all of my races there is something that i can do better and learn for next time i think if i lose that if i dont think i can do any better that is the time when i should give the sport away because there is nothing else to do
7283724 i have probably become more clucky in the last six months because my sister had a baby but i am enjoying just being an auntie and being able to give the baby back trickett said
7283725 i was just leaving the village when he was just coming back and i got a photo with him which was pretty cool she said
7283726 there were so many amazing performances and i think that is what is so cool about the olympics is here is so many different athletes with so many different stories all coming together to try and achieve the same goal
7283727 its like sitting on your back porch and driving your house
7283728 their projected rates of expansion are so fast that we dont have a hope in hell of reducing greenhouse gas emissions

7283742 throughout the games china has been scrutinized by the world has opened up to the world the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects in the long term
7283743 it is clear that china has put the bar very high he said
7283744 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7283745 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose rogge said
7283746 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7283747 when i was first told how serious my cancer was my first thought was for my boys five year old bobby and three year old freddie i sat there shaking thinking how on earth can i explain this to my babies
7283748 i cant face telling my boys because they are so young they think mummy has a tummy ache
7283749 when i was told i needed an urgent hysterectomy i broke down at the thought of never having more children i have always longed for a baby girl then it hit me that some women get cancer and will never become mums
7283750 i realised i should be so thankful for my gorgeous sons and decided i was going to take this horrible disease on and win
7283751 the biggest shock was when i asked my doctor what would have happened if id stayed in india for three months
7283752 ive got no control over this disease and im bloody terrified i am going to fight the damn thing every step of the way because i have two beautiful boys who are my world

7283765 ive got all the qualifications needed to help someone like me but none of the resources said the holder of dual degrees in science and arts with a focus on community development and public health
7283766 surely this is not just happening to me said the 12 year coast resident who was once the community liaison officer for chancellor park
7283767 im a good tenant the cost of housing on the sunshine coast has become unbelievable at chancellor park people are always coming into shops looking for somewhere to live
7283768 its been hard having to keep falling back on family and friends you just get settled and then it starts all over again i guess its the luck of the draw
7283769 i dont know where they get their information tamara said
7283770 housing has been an issue on the coast for a long time resources have always been stretched beyond capacity
7283771 were eisenhower republicans here we stand for lower deficits free trade and the bond market isnt that great we help the bond market and we hurt the people who voted us in

7283773 it was obvious that the rhino was injured to some degree as it left its forest to come out on the flat terrain of the oil palm plantation
7283774 when we first got there the rhino showed signs of aggression and made mock charges at us but we kept our distance and left leaves and fruits for it to eat as the oil palm environment is not suitable for wildlife

7283785 nobody did the hard work before the introduction to see of theres enough prey
7283786 there has always been the question are there enough snowshoe hares
7283787 it would have been so helpful to have some hare population data up front
7283788 we dont have any place where we have lynx but no snowshoe hares
7283789 theres a lot about rocket science thats been figured out but forests are subject to the intricate web of life the interactions of plants animals sun air you name it
7283790 they dont often think about their land and actively make plans for it because on a day to day basis it meets their needs
7283791 when that dust settles in 20 or 30 years well see what we have left in terms of forests and what ecosystem benefits they still provide
7283792 we bought it because we really believed that rather than being developed it should be open land for us and others to enjoy
7283793 were happy with what weve done and we think it was the right thing to do in terms of helping the environment
7283794 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
7283795 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
7283796 its whether or not the public has a right to be involved
7283797 the no 1 priority for the bush administration aside from logging has been to reduce public accountability
7283798 the united states seeks to shield from judicial review certain rules that bar the public from participation in federal management decisions affecting national forests
7283799 bensmans preclusion from participation in the appeals process may yield diminished recreational enjoyment of the national forests
7283800 because environmental injuries and hardships become imminent only to the extent an environment disturbing project is proposed factual challenges to rules based on theories of environmental damage are seldom justifiable
7283801 weve gone from being characterized as environmental terrorists to being embraced this is like falling down a rabbit hole i feel like alice in wonderland
7283802 its been unbelievable to me that this has happened but this isnt my victory i just sat on guard
7283803 we hope to duplicate the things we do well one county away
7283804 the intent is to operate with a high standard of environmental stewardship
7283805 having a healthy well stocked forest will be a good investment over the long term

7283809 australia has no culture for the eating of kangaroo meat it was eaten during the starving tomes of early white settlement but was considered a poor substitute for beef sheep meats pork and chicken
7283810 why is there not some accountability demanded under this countrys libel laws are those laws so weak that any lie can be put into print with barely a peep of protest let alone legal action
7283811 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7283812 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself
7283813 you are unlikely to see a games of this stature ever again
7283814 it is not impressive at all to merely compare the level of democracy or freedom of speech between china and say the u s
7283815 but if you look into what this country has been through in the past 30 years the improvement has been drastic
7283816 the victim believed to be aged 18 years was taken by london ambulance to whipps cross hospital he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival
7283817 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information you may have the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central
7283818 did you see several males in the grass area near to the bus garage and close to selborne walk shopping centre did you see anyone run away from the scene
7283819 we are investigating further and that investigation is being led by our team in north america they are in control of the systems

7283821 we are currently in the process of working with our credit card partners to ensure that all relevant procedural standards are met and that the interests of our guests are protected
7283822 we continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information
7283823 i was really gutted because i was so looking forward to the game and keeping fingers crossed i would get some pitch time
7283824 but it wasnt to be because of delayed reaction to something i did playing for stockport against leicester city
7283825 it was something of a mystery because i cannot for the life of me recall a moment in the game when i felt anything like a twinge
7283826 it was only late on saturday as i prepared to meet up with the squad that i noticed something was not right
7283827 i reported as requested but once20it was decided i had a slight thigh strain i had to head straight back to the club
7283828 after an examination and some stretch exercises i was given the go ahead to return to belfast to collect more of my things
7283829 it has been pretty hectic ever since my move and there is no sign of it slacking because im in the process of flitting
7283830 ive got myself an apartment and ill be spending much of whatever spare time i have over the next week or so getting it into shape
7283831 that leaves me with time on my hands especially on days when there are no night games so im giving some thought to taking up golf
7283832 that seems to be the popular thing for footballers to do
7283833 it was good fun and it was nice to be back on the pitch playing i was just disappointed i didnt last a bit longer
7283834 i thought everybody played well it was a step up from last week and hopefully we can continue to improve before llanelli in the magners league
7283835 i thought we did very well and we kept them to zero which was one of our big aims
7283836 our penalty count was still a we bit high so well have to look into that before the magners league start i thought it was a big improvement on last week in all facets of play
7283837 but although it was a good win we cant go over the top about it and there is still a lot to improve im sure well go through the video and find those things
7283838 at the start of the game our forwards were immense and they gave us the platform queensland turned the ball over a few times and that allowed us to push us them back
7283839 we put pressure on them but we were disappointed not to get more points in the first half thats something we need to work on our patience and the execution of a few plays but all in all it was a good start
7283840 they will be tough i think its their last pre season game so they will send a strong side over theyll be ready for the start of the premiership
7283841 they are a very physical side so it will be another step up but if we perform as we did against queensland i cant see why we cant beat them
7283842 i know a few of the worcester guys and they have signed chris latham but i dont know if hell be over
7283843 they have always boasted a big physical pack and they base their game around that it will be a direct game and a real stern test before we go into the magners league action but it will be enjoyed
7283844 i bet you wonder what all the fuss was about
7283845 our boss wants to sign you but he will only make a move for you if he thought you would want to come to us
7283846 i heard some things that there were three or four gun shot wounds and that it was about an hour and a half until he was found
7283847 he the victim usually doesnt get mixed up in these kind of things
7283848 the central otago region consistently produces top quality pinot noir so its no surprise that the area has produced this years champion wine of show
7283849 it is very encouraging to see such high quality wines being produced across a range of emerging varietals this is testament to the diversity of new zealand as a winegrowing nation
7283850 im a little disappointed not to make the top 20 but you can only do what you can
7283851 it is a huge honour to be carrying the flag at the closing ceremony when you consider the standard of the team it is a very special honour for me
7283852 nuns are above all women and beauty is a gift from god
7283853 this contest will be a way to show there isnt just the beauty we see on television but also a more discrete charm
7283854 you really think all nuns are old stunted and sad this isnt the case any more thanks to the arrival in our country of young and vital nuns
7283855 there are numerous examples of how the olympic movement can create a powerful impact on the launch of a new global brand
7283856 in the beijing 2008 olympic games the company that continues that tradition is lenovo
7283857 lenovo has directed its hardware service and marketing programs so skillfully at the beijing 2008 olympic games that the ioc believes this sponsorship will have a long term lasting impact on the lenovo brand
7283858 we have worked to be comprehensive creative and cutting edge in our marketing activation
7283859 from our billboard advertisements to our teams of brand ambassadors to our multiple sites on the olympic green lenovos goal is to support and engage people everywhere who use personal computers to create the worlds greatest ideas
7283860 the olympic torch demonstrates lenovos design leadership just as our flawless operation of the olympic games technology systems demonstrates world class products and our brand
7283861 the proposed e money regulations will put in place a prudential framework for bank issuers as well as their business partnership with non bank e money service providers

7283866 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy
7283867 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7283868 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick does anybody really think that they didnt get what we had because they didnt have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment of course not it was because there was no platform upon which they could stand
7283869 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go a university why is it that my wife is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come after 12 hours and play football for four hours its because they didnt have a platform on which to stand
7283870 i think obama will make a fantastic president but i think biden will bring the balance to the ticket thats needed
7283871 his mouth has gotten him into trouble sometimes it did that night with me but hes a very passionate man who is intelligent about the issues in this country
7283872 i think perhaps under stressful situations at times all of us may embellish a little bit and may not handle it 100 percent the way we should
7283873 i feel sorry that this particular thing that i was involved in affected him as adversely as it did
7283874 i owe you a big apology its 20 years too late
7283875 i came out of there that night shaking my head
7283876 absolutely i was insulted he was toe to toe with me and pointing his finger in my face but the more i learned and the more that event went on it just got ridiculous
7283877 i learnt more about singing during the two weeks of this course than ive done in three years of singing lessons
7283878 it is a tremendous honour to be appointed captain of any side particularly one that is packed with quality experienced players
7283879 so understandably im delighted to be invited to continue as ospreys captain
7283880 personally i believe that my first year in the role went well and the edf energy cup win stands out as an obvious highlight
7283881 but im sensible enough to know that i can continue to improve as captain and will be constantly looking to do so
7283882 within the ospreys camp we have a number of leaders each of whom has an input on a daily basis their support makes the role of captain that much easier
7283883 i think the canadians do a better job at this sort of stuff theyre a little smarter and little more loftier than they are here in the states and so i thought why not
7283884 youve got to enter these things with good faith anyways if theyre going to chew me up theyre going to chew me up
7283885 they show up with cameras and stuff in missoula and as theyre unpacking the cameras and setting them up in my living room im thinking what have i done
7283886 jokes lewis who lives alone on the expansive property part of which he leases to a local cattle farmer
7283887 theres obviously no hurry the worlds not waiting for a huey lewis and the news cd and new material
7283888 and nobody that we play to live cares either frankly but as a storyteller you need a new story every once in a while i think you make a record for yourselves and nowadays and especially in todays pop market if you will with music being so segregated you know rap over here and country over here there is no station for us so its liberating in a way
7283889 weve done these package tours with fellow 80s era band chicago
7283890 they never get tired of playing its crazy they work harder than anybody and we had such a good time on the last one so there were some plans afoot to maybe tour canada which should be great
7283891 in europe weve never had that many hits power of love was pretty much our only really big hit and so they actually see us as a real rock band a rhythm and blues rootsy rock band and our fans are not pop fans but the intellectuals
7283892 the audience is mostly guys theyre all smoking cigarettes and its fantastic you can do a johnnie taylor song and they know what it is they dont know what it is in america but theyll know it in france
7283893 the heart he shows the quality of his game is there and he knows his position on the pitch
7283894 what we are seeing is someone who is expending too much energy in the wrong way if wayne is prepared to listen to us well stop it
7283895 although we accept he has that selfless nature we still want him to be regarded as a goalscorer
7283896 if we are not winning the game and its not happening i get frustrated i like to win
7283897 i dont like losing so if youre telling me thats wrong then i wont believe it im a team player i am not concerned about being selfish
7283898 everyone is talking about me scoring more goals but we won the premier league and champions league last season so if that happens again id be delighted
7283899 i will feel the burden because with the forwards we have like carlos tevez who likes to drop in and thats his best position it would mean i would have to stay further forward
7283900 there has been a lot of talk about us bringing in another forward and hopefully we could do that to strengthen the team and that would help us spread things out
7283901 maybe we could change things for certain games but if a forward doesnt come in then i am sure we can deal with that
7283902 i dont know if i will have to score more well have to wait and see

7283908 un contratto matrimoniale si pu fare anche per una bambina di un anno ha aggiunto con il consenso del tutore
7283909 questi matrimoni avevano senso quando gli sposi vivevano in una famiglia allargata nella famiglia autonoma si trovano davanti a responsabilit materiali e psicologiche che non sanno affrontare

7283923 these people following the philosophy of balaguer was stupid to beginwith balaguer was nothing more than the continuation of trujillos legacy of unelected dictatorship from what i have read in thehistory books andreported locally by dominicans
7283924 laugh all you want el partido rojo will always have the last laugh
7283925 balaguer um let me see um nope its best that his so called party join him in that great corrupt national palace in the sky
7283926 like most non dominicans who have lived in the d r i know more about dominican history than most dominicans
7283927 mensen geloven nog wel maar weten alleen niet meer zo goed in wat nu juist
7283928 stellen zij zich nog vragen bij de verhalen de symbolen en rituelen die mee aan de basis liggen van hun school
7283929 de grens tussen eenzaamheid en samenzijn tussen individualiteit en verbondenheid krijgt een nieuwe dimensie
7283930 de meerderheid van alle vlamingen groeide op volgens het katholieke onderwijs en opvoedingspatroon
7283931 slechts een te verwaarlozen minderheid werd gevormd vanuit protestantse hoek
7283932 daarnaast was er nog de vrijzinnigheid en sinds de laatste decennia is der de multiculturele samenleving
7283933 is godsdienst niet louter een zaak van het hart en de innerlijkheid
7283934 ze heeft ook invloed op en is medebepalend voor het ethos van de school
7283935 in een multireligieuze en gepluraliseerde context kunnen we de katholieke school niet langer tot het christendom alleen beperken
7283936 maar de doorwerking van het christendom blijft wel bijzondere aandacht krijgen voor de school
7283937 between the western narrative and the rest of the world could not be greater
7283938 the main thing is not to be intimidated very few streets will be closed there are dozens of activities the public can participate in you just need to approach them from ways other than speer boulevard

7283941 if you go a couple blocks out you can save money
7283942 it might be like a broncos game where you would want to leave a little more time for coming into the city but there are so many ways to get into denver

7283951 ik heb voor honderd duizend euro een filmzaal in dat huis voor haar laten inrichten
7283952 ik heb mijn mercedes dealer opdracht gegeven om een luxe cabriolet bij haar af te leveren
7283953 wel jullie weten hoe graag mamma de bijbel leest omdat haar ogen zo slecht geworden zijn kan ze dat niet meer doen ik kwam onlangs een priester tegen die me vertelde over een papagaai die de hele bijbel kan opzeggen het heeft twintig paters 12 jaar gekost om het hem allemaal te leren maar nu is ie zo goed dat je alleen maar het hoofdstuk en vers hoeft te noemen en hij zegt het op ik heb moeten beloven dat ik twintig jaar lang ieder jaar honderd duizend euro aan de kerk zal geven om hem te krijgen maar ik vond dat mamma dat dubbel en dwars waard is
7283954 jan het huis dat je voor me gebouwd hebt is zo enorm groot dat ik er maar een kamer van gebruik al moet ik wel het hele godganse huis schoonhouden niettemin wel bedankt
7283955 piet ik ben te oud om op reis te gaan en mijn boodschappen worden thuis bezorgd dus de mercedes staat buiten te roesten maar het was een aardig idee wel bedankt
7283956 karel die filmzaal heeft dolby geluid en er kunnen wel 50 mensen in prachtig maar al mijn vrienden en kennissen zijn dood ik ben stokdoof en praktisch blind dus ik kom er nooit maar bedankt voor de goede bedoeling
7283957 mijn lieve henkie jij bent de enige zoon die genoeg om me geeft om iets te bedenken waar je me echt een groot plezier mee kon doen de kip was heerlijk heel hartelijk bedankt
7283958 we hope this article about our new line and business philosophy will be an inspiration for our peers to think outside the box and continue to set the bar higher for floral service
7283959 this could be the most morally loathsome film ever made
7283960 little more than a snuff film dressed up as an art house flick
7283961 after a while you may feel that youre watching a particularly scenic snuff film
7283962 this is death porn shocking for the sake of being shocking and little else
7283963 i went to this guys apartment afterward with the assistant medical examiner
7283964 the guy was in his thirties lived alone pretty bare apartment
7283965 everything absolutely everything ive done has been for this i knew it was a far chance but i did absolutely everything i could to give myself the best chance of doing it its actually happened and i never thought it would
7283966 the university is first and foremost a place where students faculty and administrators alike constantly engage in learning its now time for all of us to learn anew the lessons of repentance forgiveness and reconciliation
7283967 how can i stay i dont think i can stay
7283968 bottom line here is that theres something of integrity being sacrificed and thats what is most disturbing to me
7283969 way down inside woman you need it im gonna give ya my love im gonna give ya every inch of my love oh shake for me girl i wanna be your back door man

7283971 a todos los participantes y a todos lo que les han apoyado tan bien env o mis m s calurosas felicitaciones como naci n ahora miramos la celebraci n de los juegos ol mpicos de londres
7283972 esta noche ponemos fin a 16 d as gloriosos que recordaremos para siempre gracias al pueblo de china a todos los maravillosos voluntarios y al comit organizador con estos juegos el mundo aprendi m s de china y china aprendi m s del mundo
7283973 estrellas que lo fueron en juegos pasados han vuelto a deleitarnos
7283974 sois verdaderos modelos nos hab is mostrado el poder unificador del deporte el esp ritu ol mpico vive entre adversarios de pa ses en conflicto mantened ese esp ritu vivo cuando regres is a vuestras casas
7283975 y ahora de acuerdo con la tradici n declaro clausurados los juegos de la xxix olimpiada y convoco a la juventud del mundo para que acudan a londres de aqu en cuatro a os para celebrar los juegos de la xxx olimpiada
7283976 deportistas de 204 pa ses y regiones han competido en el esp ritu ol mpico han mostrado su gran perseverancia han dado lo mejor de s en un ambiente deportivo y han conseguido magn ficos resultados batiendo 38 r cords mundiales
7283977 its not appropriate for us to comment on a specific market
7283978 but this is the real quality thats why i must ask a higher price
7283979 public sale of the products with fake brands is not allowed but some times in some cases people could still buy them here depending on the customers demands
7283980 this is just like the sale of cocaine though its sale is illegal in the united states the u s is still the worlds largest market for the sale of cocaine because the demand is there
7283981 china is not always known as a country thats as aggressive in the protection of its intellectual property as some other jurisdictions but it has been very aggressive in using whatever means to protect the olympics
7283982 having the laws is important but having an economic incentive to use the laws is equally important
7283983 would seem to deter sellers of fake olympic licensed products
7283984 we would always encourage our staff to respect brand integrity by not purchasing counterfeit goods
7283985 dont you worry about the distance im right there if you get lonely
7283986 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno

7284009 from a new jersey point of view this was a turning point for hague the rally absolutely overwhelmed roosevelt and the turnout absolutely convinced him hague was a powerful figure in the new jersey democratic party
7284010 roosevelt made a deal with hague that from then on assuming he won hague would be the guy he dealt with in new jersey
7284011 never was the showmanship of mayor frank hague so manifest as in this days outpouring of a crowd estimated at 150 000 to 200 000

7284030 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7284031 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather

7284033 you need to get out more expand your horizons this isnt normal and isnt good for a teenager
7284034 why are you so narrow minded not everybody needs people as much as you do were all different you shouldnt judge so quickly its a bit hypocritical anyway you dont have many friends either
7284035 find a nice girl and marry her quickly youre good looking so do it otherwise youll be very lonely later on since you find it so difficult to speak to people and make friends trust me
7284036 these are genuine documents nobody can challenge you just give me your photographs and choose a name in four weeks youll have a new identity

7284038 he said its easy to find buyers especially on fridays at the main jumma prayers when the mosque is packed he then handed me a passport and asked me to deliver to a bangladeshi whos here illegally
7284039 i was so furious i came straight to the news of the world not only is it against our religion to commit fraud these documents could be used by extremists
7284040 i can help we can make as many passports as you want
7284041 these are 100 per cent genuine passports i know a bulgarian who has a connection in the home office over there thats how i get them i charge 2 500 but as you will want more i can do them for 2 000 a piece
7284042 a little boogie woogie in the back of my mind
7284043 pete and i have been having a rotten time with the british media they report on everything we do and we are having serious problems scoring our next fix of gear on which our lives depend we figure that the return of gary glitter will take all the media attention and persecution away from us so to show our gratitude we thought the least we could do was pay tribute by way of thanks to gary thanks gary we will sure get neatly out of our brains thanks to you coming home welcome back gary
7284044 it will be nice to see my song back at number one again especially since when it was number one back in 1973 gary glitter was the biggest pop star around and to outsell him was an amazing achievement so its nice that the song has now become a tribute to him
7284045 we are disturbed by the fact that the name of our band asia has been abused by somebody like gary glitter in conjunction with the world media
7284046 in the final minute i looked at my team mates you could see victory in their eyes
7284047 we knew we had done it we had finally won at the olympic games that joy defies description
7284048 it was a strange moment after losing the game we had to put it in perspective and think we really didnt lose the gold medal we won the silver

7284054 i have money in property and in this and that but at the end of the day it means nothing to me really
7284055 money wouldnt come on my list of priorities at all all i want is to be able to get a bit of money to eat every week and thatll keep me going
7284056 i wanted to give myself time to heal so that when i got out there again id be ready to give whoever i am with the respect and attention she deserves
7284057 i am ready i am open to giving these girls everything i can to find the one that is right for me all i am missing really is someone to share my life with theres no guarantee but 25 girls its a real opportunity to find just one
7284058 all i could think was oh man i am so excited mostly because really i am just the most regular guy you could ever come across and for this to be happening to me is unbelievable

7284060 the government has allocated rs 306 82 billion for establishing 16 central universities 370 colleges eight national institutes of technology nits 20 indian institutes of information technology iiits five indian institutes of science education and research iisers and 50 centres for training and research in frontier areas
7284061 however according to estimates by the planning commission this fund is not enough and the required resource gap will remain rs 2 22 trillion
7284062 as per the planning commission the country needs an additional 200 universities it is thus clear that public resources would not be sufficient to meet the ever growing demand for quality in higher education and increasing private sector investment and participation will be required to meet such demands
7284063 stas tuvieron muchas consecuencias tr gicas en otras pocas de la historia

7284066 no creemos que proteger a los ciudadanos sin recursos tanto musulmanes como coptos de la venta de sus rganos profundice en la divisi n sectaria

7284076 ik word al ten onrechte beschuldigd en deze zaak heeft helemaal niks met armstrong te maken

7284078 fixed an issue that could allow cross site scripting as reported by chris weber of casaba security details will be disclosed at a later date
7284079 opera thinks it is acceptable under specific circumstances to release a security update without publishing an advisory for the specific bug
7284080 if we publish without an advisory it is often because other vendors have not issued patches
7284081 publishing a full advisory only because weve patched something could leave users of other products unprotected while giving malicious hackers the information needed to cause damage
7284082 this is a missile cruiser it has tomahawk missiles it has an array of weapons on board no doubt this is going to be sending negative signals to the russian command
7284083 the railway is vital not just for the georgian economy but for the economy of neighbouring countries
7284084 the investigators suspect the russian forces that left there two days ago left a mine on the railroad
7284085 about a week ago on the same railroad a major bridge was exploded by the russian invaders and as they have left the area they have left mines
7284086 insisted on the importance of a rapid pullout of russian soldiers present on the poti senaki route

7284088 the international federation has required the delivery of birth certificates and all the documents like family books entries in schools and things like that
7284089 they have received the documents and at first sight it seems to be ok
7284090 the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7284091 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared
7284092 however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games
7284093 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
7284094 si bien technorati est muriendo lentamente y va camino al olv
7284095 i will only be happy if they get substantial convictions
7284096 it will always be somewhere in the back of his mind and im sure it takes part in some of his dreams
7284097 it was a terrible thing to happen that should never have happened
7284098 if we call our case we lose that last kick at the cat opportunity as well
7284099 by not calling evidence the crown has to draw all the strings together and try and come up with a common thread and then we have an opportunity to hear the entirety of that argument before we make ours
7284100 in general theres a circumstantial body of evidence that the crown is going to rely on and suggest that it is sufficient to prove his involvement
7284101 obviously the man was kidnapped its a question of who did it or if you will what involvement they had
7284102 i might have something to say after the verdict but not now
7284103 our job is going to be to say when you look at the evidence carefully that actually isnt what occurred
7284104 basically the law on circumstantial evidence is such that if theres other reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence the judge is obliged to consider those
7284105 its all stuff that can be dealt with by way of argument because if there are other inferences that can be drawn he silverman is obliged to consider them
7284106 hes so experienced as a former criminal defence lawyer himself that he is capable of doing that
7284107 if it was a jury trial it would have been substantially different
7284108 for these guys that means getting up at five oclock in the morning getting shipped in
7284109 its a long long day for these guys because they have to come in so early and theyre stuck downtown they dont get back until close to suppertime
7284110 theyre all out looking for renewable clean power and a way to lasso it
7284111 its exciting that people are interested because the more people who are interested the lower the prices are going to be because the greater the competition will be
7284112 we may have a starting gate that has 200 horses in it
7284113 i expect theres going to be a lot of bidders in this clean power call but still the b c utilities commission has to decide the demand and confirm b c hydros need and it also has to confirm all contracts b c hydro has to enter into
7284114 youve got the potential for wind projects in this province
7284115 youve got the potential for run of river hydro projects in this province maybe someones come in on the tidal side or there is the ocean side i dont know because right now its so early its hard to tell how big the starting gate is for the horse race
7284116 all new electricity generating projects are going have to have zero net greenhouse gas emissions
7284117 the reason for these calls is were committed to be electricity self sufficient by 2016
7284118 the dilemma with this field is there is a lot of hyperbole and a lot of dramatic positioning driven sometimes by very real ecological concerns sometimes by other factors
7284119 every builder has to pound the ground and cut the forest down to put a house in its place
7284120 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat
7284121 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face

7284128 it was a trial im really excited about it because we went to this gay party in paris and it was really amazing and all these gay men were singing the words and they didnt even know it
7284129 i have a good feeling about it we call it crocodile house

7284251 it was something of a mystery because i cannot for the life of me recall a moment in the game when i felt anything like a twinge
7284252 it was only late on saturday as i prepared to meet up with the squad that i noticed something was not right
7284253 i reported as requested but once20it was decided i had a slight thigh strain i had to head straight back to the club

7284260 there they go again time warner today publicly offered to air badger football games on a pay per view basis time warner is well aware that it cannot selectively choose to air a networks programming in lieu of full carriage in addition offering to do so to a customer base it has effectively ignored for the past year in not carrying the network is counter productive and creates both confusion and false hope
7284261 while proposals have recently been exchanged there is a wide gap between what time warner and its other competitors would seem to agree is reasonable and fair somehow americas top cable operator largest telephone company and two satellite providers have each decided to make the big ten network available to their customers there are another 230 or so similar companies serving more than 55 million homes and seven out of every 10 folks in the eight big ten states that each carry the network too time warner has already had more than 18 months to decide to offer the big ten network to its customers and in a statement wednesday said we are ready to carry the network fine then they should carry the network and at terms comparable to the networks other agreements or they should tell their customers they have decided not to either way badger fans deserve to know the truth

7284307 our boss wants to sign you but he will only make a move for you if he thought you would want to come to us
7284308 it was good fun and it was nice to be back on the pitch playing i was just disappointed i didnt last a bit longer
7284309 i thought everybody played well it was a step up from last week and hopefully we can continue to improve before llanelli in the magners league
7284310 i thought we did very well and we kept them to zero which was one of our big aims
7284311 our penalty count was still a we bit high so well have to look into that before the magners league start i thought it was a big improvement on last week in all facets of play
7284312 but although it was a good win we cant go over the top about it and there is still a lot to improve im sure well go through the video and find those things
7284313 at the start of the game our forwards were immense and they gave us the platform queensland turned the ball over a few times and that allowed us to push us them back
7284314 we put pressure on them but we were disappointed not to get more points in the first half thats something we need to work on our patience and the execution of a few plays but all in all it was a good start
7284315 they will be tough i think its their last pre season game so they will send a strong side over theyll be ready for the start of the premiership
7284316 they are a very physical side so it will be another step up but if we perform as we did against queensland i cant see why we cant beat them
7284317 i know a few of the worcester guys and they have signed chris latham but i dont know if hell be over
7284318 they have always boasted a big physical pack and they base their game around that it will be a direct game and a real stern test before we go into the magners league action but it will be enjoyed

7284365 bpw australia is appalled to see that sex workers in tasmania are being discriminated against on the basis of their occupation
7284366 i am surprised that tasmanian does not support equality for all women who work
7284367 every person who works should be covered by state legislation and yet if they dont legalise brothels the workers dont have a legal employer and every legal employer must comply with the occupational health and safety act
7284368 she ms giddings completely missed the point because she is denying the right of sex workers in tasmania to be covered by the act
7284369 if tasmania wants to really treat all women fairly they should legalise the sex workers
7284370 the underground nature of the business forces us to work from our homes rather than in the safer environment of a brothel
7284371 ive known of workers whove been attacked in their own homes by former clients or their own pimps and there isnt anything they can do about it
7284372 some of these workers have children and theyre just trying to make money to support them
7284373 this really does come down to the fact that when we had the opportunity a couple of years ago with legislation that was being debated through the parliament the then attorney general judy jackson wanted to legalise but heavily regulate the sex industry so that we could provide these forms of protections for the industry
7284374 unfortunately the tasmanian parliament and large parts of the tasmanian community said they would not accept that here in tasmania and we ended up having to make brothels illegal
7284375 things are going very well at the moment and everything is coming together we have a very committed group on stage and behind the scenes
7284376 its starting to get to that exciting stage now when the show starts to come to life especially now we have the orchestra behind us
7284377 the orchestra is just wonderful they bring so much to the show
7284378 there are still places we need to work with but that is rehearsal and things are looking really good
7284379 do you think that islam limits muslims to fully integrate themselves into a western society like sweden
7284380 yes yes i think muslims can integrate assimilation no integration yes the problem is that christians dont know much about islam muslims know much more about christianity and judaism
7284381 before i left he cautioned me about the growing gulf between young muslims and native swedes many people accuse islam and young muslims have had enough the conflict starts because young muslims want to defend islam they want swedes to know they are not terrorists its ignorance about islam that breeds conflict
7284382 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
7284383 we would strongly encourage the state government and the council to work together to fix it because all sides are obviously committed to flood protection on the tamar
7284384 we are talking to both sides and jodie campbell will do all that is necessary to facilitate an outcome
7284385 we will have discussions and i am confident we will sort it out next week we do have solutions in mind
7284386 we are concerned by the funding threat and we are trying to arrange a meeting with the premier and treasurer with state parliament being held in launceston this week
7284387 we are all concerned about flood protection so i am sure a solution can be found

7284390 we already have plans to replace another bridge in this manner
7284391 civic square is still my number one location i really really want civic square and i will be pursuing that
7284392 but in the meantime i need another location to start on november 8 because civic square will not be available by then hopefully it would be a temporary location until civic square became available
7284393 a lot of the stallholders i have lined up already have tried the other two markets evandale and inveresk and they have not been very successful with their products
7284394 i dont have a north south rivalry about salamanca market but i believe that with the right mix of products launceston people people from the north west coast and the east coast and tourists would support a weekly summer market in launceston
7284395 the problem we have is that during the winter the people drop off to a point where the market would probably not be viable
7284396 salamanca has been around for many years and they have that name behind them whereas in the beginning i only plan to do a market in the summer months

7284424 este d a en el que quintana de la serena les dedica una plaza es un paso m s en el reconocimiento p blico que todas ellas merecen reconocimiento memoria justicia y dignidad
7284425 un buen hombre un hombre trabajador un hombre sencillo que fue asesinado el 7 de marzo de 2008 por sus ideas socialistas
7284426 para nosotros para mi familia estos meses han sido muy duros al principio nos vimos envueltos en el desconcierto y la desesperaci n el asesinato de mi padre es un golpe cruel que ha marcado nuestras vidas para siempre y del que dif cilmente podremos recuperarnos alg n d a
7284427 han sido meses de apoyarnos mutuamente de pensar y de intentar entender por qu por qu a mi padre por qu la vida ha sido tan brutal y tan inhumana qu ha logrado eta asesinando a mi padre por qu decidi eta ejecutar a mi padre por qu se fij en l
7284428 nada puede justificarlo no puede haber comprensi n ni tolerancia para un asesinato ning n objetivo pol tico justifica el asesinato de mi padre ning n objetivo pol tico justifica el terrorismo y tampoco nada puede justificar el mirar para otro lado nada puede justificar estar impasible ante tanto dolor y tanto horror
7284429 para nosotros y para todas las v ctimas del terrorismo verdad justicia y memoria pues no queremos que el asesinato de mi padre ni ning n asesinato terrorista quede impune
7284430 exigimos que los asesinos de mi padre los que le marcaron con una diana los que organizaron su asesinato y los que empu aron y dispararon los cinco fatales disparos as como los que los han amparado sean detenidos juzgados y encarcelados
7284431 maldita sea eta maldito sea el terrorismo y malditos los que lo apoyan y lo justifican
7284432 es un gesto que honra a un pueblo que ha visto tambi n caer a muchos de sus ciudadanos a manos de los asesinos de eta
7284433 en rgicamente el atentado ayer en badajoz del monolito en honor de las v ctimas
7284434 jam s borrar is la memoria de las v ctimas del terrorismo
7284435 su recuerdo permanecer fuerte e inalterable en la memoria colectiva de los ciudadanos y ciudadanas y ellos los terroristas y sus secuaces acabar n en la c rcel cumpliendo condena por los delitos que han cometido
7284436 el pueblo extreme o ha dejado mucha sangre derramada en euskadi por los atentados de los terroristas v ctimas algunas que adem s de ser violentamente asesinadas sufrieron la humillaci n y el doble dolor de abandonar euskadi por la puerta de atr s solas insultadas y ante la indiferencia y la mirada fr a de muchos de nosotros
7284437 eso hoy ha cambiado las v ctimas merecen la puerta principal en la casa de la democracia que hemos construido entre todos y todas
7284438 siempre estar del lado de las v ctimas del terrorismo y nunca de los asesinos
7284439 jam s podremos recompensar ni reparar tanto dolor tanta injusticia y tan grande lecci n de humanidad y ciudadan a
7284440 no hay mayor ni m s cruel cadena perpetua que haber enterrado a tu padre a tus hijos por el zarpazo de la banda terrorista saber que no volver n y que los asesinos de los mismos disfruten con ese dolor ante la mirada impasible o condescendiente de la sociedad
7284441 la sociedad vasca ya no es impasible ni condescendiente con los asesinos de eta y aquellos que les apoyan y callan ante sus asesinatos por eso no entiendo como algunos miembros de partidos pol ticos con una trayectoria democr tica impecable realicen todav a declaraciones ambiguas y por tanto legitimadoras de los asesinos de eta que permanecen en la c rcel cumpliendo la condena por los delitos que han cometido matar matar y matar a ciudadanos y ciudadanas

7284451 i think its time to elect a congressman who treats everyone with respect
7284452 im not in this to diminish others im in this to represent alaska
7284453 i guess i felt that it was kind of tacky to go to somebody elses press conference
7284454 parnell seems to have made some sort of pact with this what i consider an anti alaska group this club for growth
7284455 and frankly i dont think he comes across as a fighter
7284456 i think when parnell announced it was new there was a lot of anticipation a kind of excitement as time has gone on i dont think theres been anything major thats sustained it
7284457 its just not his personality that doesnt mean he wouldnt be a good congressman
7284458 ive been accused of being arrogant being a bully and sometimes ill plead to being both of those
7284459 most of the time and every time ive done that is because im fighting for this state
7284460 when no ones listening to the congressman yelling in the corner the loss of respect among his colleagues that just speaks to ineffectiveness
7284461 both of them claim to be born again christians dont they
7284462 my work in florida is finished but there is a lot of work to be done in alaska
7284463 im vic vickers and im running against ted stevens to stop the corruption
7284464 i like to describe this race as the first round in a 15 round boxing match
7284465 im not saying im muhammad ali but if i knock out sonny liston first round you know that would be helpful that may not happen but the most important thing is to change the system and make sure that alaskans get their fair share of oil revenues
7284466 i was kind of like a daddy to him so to speak
7284467 i said when you get there go to the supreme court building and see my brother ill call him and tell him youre coming
7284468 he doesnt seem to have lost any of his brash approach to life
7284469 straight out of some steamy afternoon soap complete with allegations of corporate fraud and romantic treachery
7284470 have you seen the racketeering suit i filed against her
7284471 ive been keeping bees for 20 years and this is the first time i dont have any honey crop
7284472 it has to be warm enough for them to want to take flight
7284473 for the first time ever i had bees starving to death on me at the end of july
7284474 maybe its the fact they were confined in the hive with bad weather maybe they thought there were greener pastures over the hill
7284475 i have people waving at me tooting at me and when i park i have half a dozen people come up to speak to me every time
7284476 and you dont feel fragile because you have no sense youre in a small car
7284477 coming up the freeway to seattle i purposely put myself in between these two great big semis and i didnt get wind buffeting at all
7284478 the nice thing is when you park in a regular parking space and you center yourself theres almost no chance that other people are going to bang into you
7284479 theres a lot of money involved and it should stay here
7284480 im voting yes because i think its good for the alaska economy
7284481 this commission is given very broad power under this initiative so you would have three individuals potentially who could decide what types of gaming can take place in the state up to a full blown casino
7284482 theres nothing in here that sets any kind of parameters as far as i can tell
7284483 theres a reason why they say what happens in vegas stays in vegas
7284484 random processes could promote job sharing in many different types of organisms
7284485 ball i really dont have the energy to give a single thought you
7284486 well were close i think yeh if it sucks we wont stay and ill meet you there at some watering hole
7284487 you know dont you its a three story tent built in the middle of a city
7284488 in my view and for the good of the us face in the world and for the homeland itself it would be wise to get into talks with world country leaders which bush has either made mad or he doesnt want to talk to further it would be better for the us to consult before they act and create wars the 1st war with irak has shown harmony among the world for a very reasonable reason not oil but kuwait the second one is very questionable and as sooner as the us drops out the better as a good face for the us to make peace on earth the soldiers should have after a vacation the plan in mind to create waterlines and reserves in africa and end the hunger and death over there if the us would do so others will join and it will be good for the whole world if africa becomes a worls storage of food besides the us hunger on corn fuel could be solved as well
7284489 you have to understand that we are poorly educated and that our media is run by entertainers and we allow even the stupidest people to vote i am not a dumbass myself you must believe me

7284498 the stadium is already a world famous athletics venue and its reputation as a major training facility is growing
7284499 our aim now is to capitalise on what we already have here by developing something really special
7284500 you poor man oh most certainly i was poor once too and i know how hard it can be to make ends meet
7284501 no you really do not understand sir im not poor i just needed a quarter for the parking meter here
7284502 you dont need to be ashamed good sir here take all that i have
7284503 see ive got money i have a great job that pays me well i live in a house on the upper east side i just dont have a quarter
7284504 this young man here is so poor he doesnt even have a quarter
7284505 thats what happens when the neo cons and their big business allies are in power always taxing the people that make this country work while giving huge tax breaks to their corporate crony friends and cutting back on social programs
7284506 what no lady i just need a quarter for the parking meter
7284507 this has got to be the worst administration in the history of this country why i could not even afford my usual whole grain bread from the gourmet store down the road i had to settle for this generic stuff that tastes like day old cardboard from the low class supermarket here
7284508 filthy rich people driving around in their fancy cars while people like this man suffer thinking they are so much better than him the owner of this car should give this man the quarter he so desperately needs
7284509 no war for oil down with the president impeach him
7284510 so you say that all this started because someone stole your wallet
7284511 sir what are you talking about we got a report that a riot started because this man was robbed by an illegal alien
7284512 i just asked for a quarter for the parking meter and
7284513 you expect us to believe that all these people got worked up like this over you asking for a quarter for a parking meter
7284514 people arent that insane now excuse us please we have a story to cover
7284515 nearly half of registered voters 47 percent continue to think obama lacks the experience it takes to serve effectively as president a lot to lose on this basic qualification
7284516 mccain leads him by 2 1 margins as more knowledgeable on world affairs and as better suited to be commander in chief and has moved ahead in trust to handle international relations
7284517 mccain faces his own challenges fifty seven percent think hed lead in the same direction as the heavily unpopular george w bush
7284518 the results show little movement from the last post abc survey conducted in mid july before obama embarked on a highly publicized trip overseas and prior to a series of fierce exchanges between the campaigns
7284519 one is to resolve doubts about his qualifications and agenda that mccain has seeded this summer with ads portraying the democrat as a vapid celebrity and a soft on defense tax and spend liberal even more important many argue obama must reframe the fundamental choice in the election from whether he is ready to be president to whether the country wants to continue in the direction set by bush particularly on economic policy
7284520 my main goal at this convention and through my speech is to convey a sense of urgency that so many families are feeling across the country
7284521 and to present a clear choice between continuing the same economic policies that have caused record foreclosures rising unemployment rising inflation flat and declining incomes and wages and a new approach to economic policies that i believe will create prosperity growth and fairness
7284522 going on the attack when running a campaign for change is risky obama acknowledges
7284523 its something i worry about and wrestle with all the time i really prefer having a debate about issues
7284524 while obama can continue to try to reassure resistant clinton loyalists in appalachia that hes not a bogeyman from madrassaland he must also move on to the bigger picture for everyone else
7284525 he must rekindle the fierce urgency of now but not as he did in the primaries merely to evoke uplifting echoes of the civil rights struggle or the need for withdrawal from iraq
7284526 r i p change we can believe in the fierce urgency of the 21st century demands change before its too late
7284527 who despite the hype doesnt seem to know as much about foreign affairs as they want us to believe and is also confused as to how many homes he owns and what kind of car he drives
7284528 i dont think the race is so much about the political climate
7284529 i think its really about barack obama and john mccain obama tory
7284530 he has been a huge supporter of israel and has been so in a very erudite fashion because he knows all the players not only in israel but in the palestinian authority
7284531 die mensen moeten niet zeuren er rijdt overal zwaar verkeer door veendam bovendien zijn ze al verwend met dubbel glas en geluidsarm asfalt
7284532 its farcical for dr nelson to demand an economic statement at the very time he is trying to punch a multi billion dollar hole in our strong budget surplus by blocking key parts of it in the senate
7284533 playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7284534 taken together what were doing in tax coag and the emissions trading system represent a policy triangle of enduring reforms which will bolster that long run economic prosperity we need to build for future generations
7284535 this is an agenda that comes straight from what the prime minister likes to call the
7284536 it recognises australians are practical and a bit cautious about reform and they only trust it when it comes from the centre
7284537 this is why we will resist urgings to pick up radical agendas from the left or the right to shut down the coal industry for example or the car industry
7284538 once we got hold of the ball and moved it forward quickly we knew dan and fab and carlos hernandez would cause a lot of trouble and that was exactly how it worked out
7284539 it was just great to see both the performance and the result
7284540 weve got 21 rounds to get in the finals so you can never lose sight of that fact
7284541 but lifes much easier if you pick up points early on theres a good feel around the team and picking up points is just vital all the way through
7284542 were not going to win every week but it certainly helps
7284543 a perfect storm of parking demand would be nice on an occasional basis
7284544 the amount of cash and securities advanced by anz to brokers peaked at approximately 2 billion in august 2007
7284545 a lot hinging on how this set is played out
7284546 a lot of ups and downs that time he went up to hit the ball down
7284547 for me it is as if ive won the champions league
7284548 ik voel even veel druk als pakweg drie weken geleden
7284549 als je wil winnen is er altijd druk of je nummer n of twee bent
7284550 ik besef ook dat ik snel weer nummer twee kan zijn maar ik geniet van het moment je speelt niet elke dag even goed als ik de laatste zes maanden
7284551 prima sinds miami in maart voel ik me echt goed op elke ondergrond en ik won twee keer op hardcourt een goed voorteken
7284552 als ik er eens over nadenk zeg ik tegen mezelf
7284553 ja maar van die boasson hagen hebben we het laatste nog niet gezien dat is een klasbak ik heb echt op mijn adem getrapt
7284554 nu kan ik een stuk vlaai eten voor de verjaardag van mijn broer en dan mijn koffers pakken
7284555 ik ben op schema die 4 dagen hebben mn moreel goed gedaan in spanje kan ik mijn ritjes kiezen
7284556 iedereen zegt dat ik er enorm scherp uitzie maar nochtans heb ik al minder gewogen dan nu maar misschien moet ik mijn vetpercentage laten meten want ik denk dat er een pak spieren meer zijn
7284557 de motivatie is alvast enorm voor het eerst wil ik naar parijs tours om te winnen en dan is er nog het wk in varese natuurlijk
7284558 het parcours is niet zo lastig als de italianen beweren ik ben er geweest en het is niet zwaarder dan madrid waar boonen het wk won red ik heb trouwens al met bondscoach bomans gepraat
7284559 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
7284560 ik viel bijna van mijn stoel ik zag haar worstelen met haar woorden en geheugen ik kon het niet geloven
7284561 ze was toen 75 jaar oud maar ik vond haar altijd tijdloos niet onderhevig aan leeftijd en bestand tegen alles
7284562 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden
7284563 als je de extra bevoegdheden gebruikt om de sociale rechten van werklozen te beperken dan hoeft het niet voor groen met de bevoegdheden die vlaanderen al heeft zet het op dit moment in op het foute project
7284564 vlaanderen uitbouwen tot transitland en logistieke poort van europa is een doodlopend project
7284565 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden

7284570 entirely factual was not misleading and did not in anyway demean the integrity and independence of the judiciary and the judicial system
7284571 taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7284572 westerners have been targeted and killed in terrorist attacks throughout somalia including mogadishu
7284573 i am happy with the negotiations to date and at this point it wouldnt be appropriate to discuss specific figures
7284574 its a waste of taxpayers money paying me a pension then making me fly back every 13 weeks
7284575 the wisdom and fairness of the law is not a matter on which i can pass judgment sympathetic as i am to mr fosters plight
7284576 it was inferred that i was a dole bludger and was holidaying at taxpayers expense
7284577 beauty junkies inside our 15 billion obsession with cosmetic surgery
7284578 het doen van push ups is niet alleen goed voor je armspieren maar voor je hele lijf wie zich geregeld opdrukt verliest bovendien beduidend minder spierkracht bij het ouder worden
7284579 kevin08 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08
7284580 i decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership and particularly about that costellos future
7284581 everyone else is commenting on it so ill just leave it to others
7284582 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan
7284583 i would expect it would be around that time that he would make it clear what his future intentions are
7284584 from my perspective peter costello has earned the right to make the decision in his good time with his family and his electors and announce it when it suits him and i expect that will be very soon
7284585 weve had all year a treasurer who is the only treasurer in the whole world that has been talking down his own economy and talking up inflation
7284586 om ouder te worden is fitheid mogelijk belangrijker dan het vetpercentage
7284587 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is it is harder for the reserve bank to reduce interest rates
7284588 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them
7284589 my personal position i grew up in a roman catholic faith but despite a lot of effort to believe i lost my faith at 14
7284590 how do you know when to fight for things and when to let it be en espa ol

7284595 if part of this plan fuels inflation a way must be found to prevent this or control any negative aspects
7284596 blocking dangerous trends of western intoxication and secularism which were infiltrating the countrys administration
7284597 but the current governments characteristics mean it has warmer support
7284598 denying its positive aspects and highlighting weaknesses and constantly speaking against it is sabotage not criticism
7284599 its just like sometimes you see some of the biggest rallies in stocks during the start of a bear market or even during a bear market
7284600 it seems like the slowdown in industrial world growth has finally cut the legs out from under the commodity rally for now
7284601 and now its really on chinas shoulders and the rest of the developing world to see whether they can hang in there
7284602 our own view is that china will do surprisingly well over the next year but whether thats enough to get oil prices rising is doubtful
7284603 the consensus is we will get some very modest growth in the second quarter were looking at all of a 0 6 per cent annualized rise in gdp which just barely offsets the decline we saw in the first quarter
7284604 it should be just enough to keep the economy out of a technical recession i think the economy will be fortunate to turn out much growth in the second half of the year either
7284605 of course now the focus turns to the earning season and i think in most cases people are looking for a bit of a deterioration in underlying earnings
7284606 and i think thats where the focus could turn for earnings

7284660 this act disgusted and shocked citizens all over the commonwealth
7284661 these violent killings were totally unnecessary particularly considering that there are rescue societies that would have taken all of the dogs regardless of their ages or conditions
7284662 clearly the time has come to enact legislation that would make this practice illegal and raise the standards under which the states commercial breeding kennel industry operates there is simply no excuse for continued inaction
7284663 this incident is a clear indicator of the need to amend current pa law and give qualified veterinarians sole authority to humanely euthanize animals in medical or behavioral circumstances as they see fit
7284664 i had no idea prior to 2006 it was illegal to have dogs in this environment then it made sense

7284711 duas corridas na espanha e dois abandonos muito azar apesar de que desta vez n o foi um problema mec nico espero que tenhamos um pouco mais de sorte em spa
7284712 sempre h perigo quando voc larga no meio do grid nesta vez foi nakajima quem bateu em n s e foi isso
7284713 briguei com o hamilton na largada mas quando vi o massa freando antes na primeira curva diminui o ataque
7284714 vi uma sacola pl stica na curva 12 e acho que ela prendeu no carro ele come ou a sair de frente mas felizmente ele acabou voando
7284715 demorou meia volta para voltar ao ritmo mas pelo menos consegui ir melhor do que o kovalainen
7284716 n o posso reclamar do segundo lugar tivemos um final de semana forte embora eu tenha enfrentado pequenos problemas de sa de
7284717 tenho um timo time para me ajudar marcamos bons pontos desta vez
7284718 no come o alinhei no lado sujo tive uma razo vel partida mas n o t o forte quanto massa precisei ag entar a press o de kubica nas primeiras curvas e tentei me manter perto do felipe
7284719 massa estava na frente e foi muito dif cil acompanh lo eu pensei que conseguiria continuar a uma certa diferen a por m ele come ou a abrir
7284720 sempre existe perigo quando voc larga no pelot o intermedi rio nakajima bateu em mim e foi isso
7284721 duas corridas na espanha e dois abandonos muito azar apesar de que agora n o foi problema t cnico
7284722 aguardamos a an lise do monopostos os mec nicos observaram a avaria e apesar da asa traseira havia danos tamb m na suspens o e na caixa de c mbio isso demoraria uma hora para trocar
7284723 finalizamos bem a corrida contudo a chave para este resultado foi a qualifica o apenas tr s d cimos da pole o que memor vel esse nosso real rendimento ficamos um pouco distante nas provas anteriores s que retornamos ao nosso melhor
7284724 fizemos uma boa sa da e me aproximei muito de lewis na segunda curva
7284725 por m eu vi o massa freando mais cedo ent o eu iria correr riscos para tentar algo eu poderia ter batido com hamilton de t o perto que est vamos

7284743 i think if we make a preliminary assessment then one can say that the games contributed to further modernization of china
7284744 all of the preparations led to significant progress in the country i think it can also be said that the games contributed to a further opening up of china
7284745 if you think of china 20 years ago nothing of the sort would have been possible thousands of journalists were in china reported about china
7284746 i think it can be said that the olympic games made a positive contribution to the future of china
7284747 the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in london to celebrate the games of the xxx olympiad
7284748 thank you to the people of china to all the wonderful volunteers and to bocog
7284749 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7284750 to the athletes tonight you were true role models you have shown us the unifying power of sport the olympic spirit lives in the warm embrace of competitive rivals from nations in conflict keep that spirit alive when you return home
7284751 the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7284752 the chinese people teeming with enthusiasm have honored the commitments they solemnly made
7284753 media censorship the abuse of migrant construction workers who built the olympic venues and the unlawful forced evictions of hundreds of thousands of chinese citizens from their homes to make way for these venues
7284754 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7284755 milestone of the way to the great resurgence of the chinese nation
7284756 we have fulfilled the confidence the world put in us
7284757 dog eating in any case tends to be a seasonal pursuit
7284758 in case youre wondering there is nothing alarming about the taste of dog smothered in chilies and aromatic spices in a hunanese winter stew it might remind you of lamb for a westerner eating it can feel a little strange but is it morally different from eating say pork the dogs brought to table in china are not peoples pets but are raised as food like pigs and pigs of course are also intelligent and friendly
7284759 now i have to vote for the woman hater mccain

7284775 spain was unbelievable we had a game plan and they countered everything we did every possession counted for 40 minutes
7284776 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history
7284777 if we didnt have great character we wouldnt have a team with the great character of spain it was great basketball at the highest level and it brought out the best in us
7284778 they took this tournament very seriously i saw guys who were hungry and who wanted to get to the top and thats what theyve done but they had to work for it they have a better feel as a team they worked hard and they complemented each other it was not so much the individual stuff and they were well directed by the coaching staff
7284779 controlling the worlds second largest oil reserves was a top priority for the bush administration
7284780 the most blatant and improper contract abuse i have witnessed during the course of my professional career
7284781 assessing the condition of oil related infrastructure cleaning up oil spills or other environmental damage at oil facilities engineering design and repair or reconstruction of damaged infrastructure assisting in making facilities operational distribution of petroleum products and assisting the iraqis in resuming iraqi oil company operations
7284782 bush wanted to remove saddam through military action justified by the conjunction of terrorism and wmd weapons of mass destruction but the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy
7284783 saddam was not threatening his neighbours and his wmd capability was less than that of libya north korea or iran
7284784 also there are not many companies that can do that kind of construction work

7284811 if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security
7284812 there was complete support and sympathy for the pakistan cricket board and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making
7284813 however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete in the icc champions trophy had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7284814 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7284815 the first lap was rough as i was in the middle of the pack and lost several positions after that i tried to fight back but my front wing was damaged and it was difficult to overtake its a shame that we couldnt get into the top ten but i hope we can have a better race in spa for the belgian grand prix in a couple of weeks time
7284816 after qualifying yesterday i knew that me weekend was going to be difficult at the start i was touched by nakajima and i lost my rear wing my mechanics did everything to try and allow me to continue but my race was already compromised i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for the supporters who came here this weekend to support me i now want to concentrate on the rest to the season and the next race in spa
7284817 its very disappointing to leave this wonderful new track with no points we are particularly sorry not to have had a better race with fernando for his second home grand prix but we must now move forward and think of the next race
7284818 its a weekend to forget our objective remains to fight for fourth place in the championship and we must now stay focussed for the races to come and continue with our efforts to grow stronger
7284819 im pretty happy with that its good to be going home with a point today as its been a long time since it happened the race went quite well for me and i was giving it my all driving what felt like qualifying laps one after the other the result is also good for the team as it shows we are getting back on track once again i would like to say that valencia has done a great job here and the race was good fun
7284820 i had a bad start and we have to find the reason for that on lap one going into turns four and five i was just behind alonso but there was a bit of a battle going on in front and i couldnt avoid him going into the corner after that i just tried to be consistent my pace was ok but i was behind barrichello and it was really difficult to overtake eventually i made it past him and my pace improved but it was too late
7284821 with the reliability of the cars these days one point is what you can expect from starting 9th and 11th on the grid kazuki went into anti stall at the start which lost him a lot of places he then had to pit for a new front wing which put paid to what would have been a one stop race nico squeezed everything he could out of the car today unfortunately we missed out on seventh place with him by a few fractions of a second in his second pit stop we now have to return to the factory to find those few tenths
7284822 we just werent quick enough we were hoping for a few safety cars to come out during the race so ran a one stop strategy but it didnt happen it was a difficult race pace wise and weve got a lot of analysis to do
7284823 i was hit from behind on the first lap i came back and passed a couple of cars but when i tried to pass one of the force indias i aborted the manoeuvre and made contact with them so sorry to them for that that damaged my barge board and the side of the car so after that the balance and downforce were very poor
7284824 a disastrous race david got involved in an incident in the first lap which damaged his car and mark who was on a one stop strategy was hoping for a safety car that never appeared he didnt have enough pace particularly after his pit stop its our most disappointing race of the year congratulations to sebastian vettel who drove very well today and demonstrated what the chassis is capable of
7284825 a poor result we were off the pace after qualifying we didnt really have any opportunity to bet on so we finished where we qualified we have poor pace and we just have to work
7284826 that was a good result and a great performance by the team the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7284827 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
7284828 this has turned into one of those good weekends after qualifying everybody was a bit disappointed but today went much better due to excellent teamwork after jarno missed saturdays practice session the crew put timos set up into jarnos car and he delivered a very good performance and a very smooth race to 5th place today timo was not feeling well but he made an excellent start managed his tyres well and put in a huge effort to complete this race with the best result im very happy that we are confirming our good pace now we will push to keep these results coming with a particular eye on the japanese grand prix later in the season
7284829 i had a good start to the race and gained three places to 13th but that was the highlight of my race really we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid after we had expected to perform a lot better i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
7284830 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pit lane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race we need to get to the bottom of the brake problems that we have had all weekend as these cost me a lot of time and positions it was a poor weekend overall
7284831 jenson got a good start and was able to make up three places during the first lap however the midfield was quite close today and with a heavy fuel load he was unable to progress through the field starting rubens from the pit lane was the right decision as he benefited from the mel e at turn 2 and ended up being further up the field than he would otherwise have been contrary to expectation though there was relatively low attrition with only three cars failing to finish and no safety cars which meant there were no real opportunities to take advantage of fundamentally we have improved the car over the august break and we saw clear signs of that progress in free practice we didnt make the most of that when it counted this weekend and we suffered in qualifying and the race as a result so our first priority will be to understand where we failed and make sure we have a more robust approach for spa and beyond we have a three day test in monza next week where we will focus on getting the most out of our recent developments
7284832 our core supporters are essentially young people who are angry about the domination of politics by frail septuagenarians

7284834 over the past four years weve seen the gradual emergence of energy efficiency as an issue for data centre managers in the region but only this year did the issue break into the top five areas of concern in a big way
7284835 interestingly the survey also shows us that power densities in asia are following closely those found today in the u s where in the past american trends were not seen as a benchmark for asia we can now draw much closer parallels between the regions which has planning implications for all of us in addressing the issue at a regional scale
7284836 this response is symptomatic of an audience that has been barraged by conflicting information from the main industry players
7284837 this was the single most important problem we set out to rectify with the energy logic symposiums because confusion leads to inaction by bringing industry leaders and decision makers together weve sought to find a cohesive understanding of the issues and identify appropriate solutions
7284838 the best way to ensure energy efficiency is through a holistic approach that includes it equipment efficiencies best practice data centre design and efficient power and cooling infrastructure
7284839 energy logic is the first practical framework that can be used to measurably reduce energy costs by applying 10 technologies and best practices that have the greatest impact on energy efficiency in the data centre
7284840 adaptivexchange will take the concepts introduced by energy logic and transform them into practical actionable solutions that can immediately be implemented in computer rooms and data centres
7284841 the event represents a major forum for data centre professionals from around the region and through the user group and survey will be used to develop and share practical energy efficiency strategies on a regional scale i encourage anyone who has even a passing interest in energy efficiency to register today
7284842 cost conscious it planning must anticipate a variety of economic scenarios
7284843 this white paper outlines the many expenses associated with a data center infrastructure and presents proven viable recession proofing strategies for maximizing operations while minimizing costs

7284851 two things are enabling us to establish this new paradigm
7284852 first is the advancement in microelectronics which provides us greater density and speed at much lower power consumption than ever before the other is a better understanding of neuroscience and how the brain functions at the synaptic neuronal network and system levels
7284853 the follow on phases of the project will create a technology that functions like the brain of a cat which comprises 108 neurons and 1012 synapses
7284854 the human brain has roughly 1011 neurons and 1015 synapses
7284855 it says here that you have been advised how to take these
7284856 they will enable me to regulate my system and allow my clinic to manipulate my cycle
7284857 we have penalised 141 people so far for drunken driving under a special drive

7284863 what would bach be writing if he were alive today
7284864 right after the olympics are over our mindset is already focused on the next four years and what we can do to change how we prepare and try some new things and thats something im looking forward to now
7284865 i still have things that i want to do in the sport ive never competed over here in london and im looking forward to really experiencing more of the city and be able to prepare myself to hopefully swim some fast times
7284866 ive no idea what im really going to do but im looking forward to trying some new events and swimming some events that i havent really had the opportunity to swim since my schedule is always so crowded
7284867 ive never really swum the backstroke or the 100m freestyle at a major international competition so bob bowman my coach is going to throw everything he has ever done coaching me out of the door and try something completely different just to see how it works open water at least those guys will still be my friends
7284868 im excited for the next four years and today is the kick off for the next four years
7284869 we are just trying a bunch of new things and if its successful then great and if not then we can go back to what we were doing
7284870 but im looking forward to having some changes because the last 10 or 15 years have been the same thing the whole time
7284871 ive got some pretty lofty dreams in my head and those goals are going to stay there until they are accomplished
7284872 this has been one of the hardest things ive ever done to be able to swim 17 times and make sure that i have to be ready to swim at my beat in every one of those races because im competing against people who are focusing just on that one race
7284873 i know that its not going to be easy getting there and there are going to be some bumps in the road here and there but everybody has bumps in the road and it really just depends on how you get over those and make sure it doesnt happen again
7284874 i dont think its going to be perfect but its going to be fun over the next few years while i finish off my career
7284875 i told myself i would never compete past the age of 30
7284876 i started swimming when i was seven and i told my coach im not swimming past the age of 30 so dont get any ideas
7284877 he said thats good because i dont want to coach you past the age of 30
7284878 every city has had its big twist on the games what they have thats different to every other county
7284879 the olympic movement is about bringing the world together im not sure what that difference will be but im looking forward to seeing what it is and how this city develops
7284880 we will draw on our wit flair imagination and ingenuity to build on what weve all witnessed in beijing and deliver a fantabulous olympics in what i consider to be not only my home but the home of sport
7284881 the next summer games return to a country which i frequently boast has either invented or codified just about every major world sport
7284882 im gonna catch usama bin laden even if i have to go to the gates of hell myself
7284883 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever

7284907 we believe that the moment is right for the government to levy a sensible one off windfall tax to guarantee social and environmental justice both now and in the future
7284908 used in the right way this could benefit the uk economy as a whole just as the new deal in 1997 created new jobs for the long term unemployed such an investment could see the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs in renewable energy production insulation building renovation and other sectors
7284909 if you want to get further growth then the state has got to take less from people in tax as you reduce the levels of taxation you will get growth

7284997 this is a place of genocide our ancestors were force marched here in 1862 and interned in the concentration camp for an entire winter so many of our people died here women and children so much of our history is ignored and suppressed we are here to tell the truth about this history and challenge the sesquicentennial celebration
7284998 two skittish horses were steered by their mounted officers through the protestors endangering everyone in their path including several small children
7284999 unsure of what to do one officer radioed for backup as reinforcements arrived one officer said i thought we came down to do some thumping a sheriffs suv tried to force its way through the crowd of protestors to clear a path for the wagon train then two kids and two women laid down in front of the suv for twenty minutes while protestors smudged prayer drums sounded and speakers addressed their message about the pasts atrocities officers conferred debating how best to remove the blockade dakota protestors cried the history of the atrocities committed including land theft ethnic cleansing bounties placed on dakota scalps up to 200 dollars the largest mass hanging in us history the horrors of the concentration camp at fort snelling and the brutalities of the war of 1862
7285000 you are benefiting from the same colonial practices which justified the genocide of the dakota people waziyatawin stated as she was pressed against the hood of a patrol car before being led away this wagon train is a fantasy of manifest destiny as some sort of righteous thing next to go were her two minor children talon and autumn cavender wilson anita rae chris mato nunpa jim anderson and diane elliot followed before the officers ceased making arrests

7285022 the candidate of change went with the status quo he picked a 35 year veteran of the senate the ultimate insider rather than a candidate from outside washington
7285023 b iden is anything but a change agent having been in office longer than half of all americans have been alive
7285024 the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution
7285025 obama is running on the slogan change we can believe in but the freshman senator selected as his running mate a six term senate institution senator joe biden of delaware
7285026 obama may decry lobbyist cash or at least federal lobbyist cash but biden has taken 344 400 from lobbyists since 1997 making lobbyists the 10th biggest contributing industry that seems a direct contradiction of the obama message
7285027 at the same time as a 36 year senate veteran biden is a washington insider an image that is at odds with the theme of change obama has promoted
7285028 the decision to go with biden 65 a washington insider over a younger politician with a lesser known national profile such as obamas friend virginia gov tim kaine reflects how tight the contest is between obama and republican john mccain
7285029 obama names sen joe biden as his vice presidential pick
7285030 on the downside biden is a consummate washington insider he was first elected to the senate in 1973 at the age of 29 and plagiarism charges forced him from the 1988 presidential contest
7285031 well the downside is this is a campaign of change who is selecting which is selecting a man whos been in the senate for over three decades there is that
7285032 biden has been in the united states senate for 36 years he was elected in 1972 the year barack obama turned eleven making him for better or worse a quintessential washington insider
7285033 t heres the 2007 abc interview in which biden said he would stand by an earlier statement that obama was not ready to serve as president it seems obama is worried that some voters are starting to agree
7285034 obama all but confessed his lack of knowledge of foreign affairs by selecting as his running mate the senates senior democratic leader on that topic
7285035 no ordinary joe the politics of the veep pick and what he brings to the party
7285036 he wanted someone who could reinforce his message of change but he needed someone with experience
7285037 o bama has spent the last 2 years discounting the experience of folks in the bush administration discounting the experience of hillary clinton and now discounting the experience of john mccain by saying that what matters is judgment not the number of years someone has spent in washington obamas pick belies that notion especially since the core of obamas judgment argument centers on his opposing the iraq war from the beginning joe biden voted for the iraq war
7285038 for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack
7285039 the picks say something profound about obama for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack the biden pick is the next logistical step in an obama campaign that has become more negative a strategic decision that may be necessary but threatens to run counter to his image
7285040 a senior obama adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said his boss has expressed impatience with what he calls a reverence inside his campaign for his message of change and new politics in other words obama is willing even eager to risk what got him this far if it gets him to the white house
7285041 its a measure of how badly the last month has gone for the once high flying obama campaign that theyre willing to risk taking on board a shoot from the lip running mate like biden
7285042 mr obamas choice of mr biden suggested some of the weaknesses the obama campaign is trying to address at a time when national polls suggest that his race with senator john mccain the presumptive republican nominee is tightening
7285043 as the associated presss ron fournier noted in an analysis this morning picking biden shows that obama and his team are concerned that questions of whether the illinois senator is ready for the job have the potential to be politically dangerous
7285044 o ne quality that has afflicted biden for as long as anyone can remember a persistent tendency to say silly offensive and off putting things
7285045 the central mystery for those who have watched biden over the years is this how could someone so smart experienced and articulate be his own worst enemy by saying just the wrong thing at just the wrong moment
7285046 bidens good for a good lets call it five gaffes before november 4th if its biden here we go again
7285047 i mean if the obama campaign when they knew this pick was coming they realized bidens good for a good lets call it five gaffes before november 4th they know this they understand this theyre willing to take that risk if its biden here we go again
7285048 the big other problem is that biden has had a tendency to make gaffes on the trail hes not always very disciplined
7285049 he cant keep his mouth shut sometimes he talks before thinking he is not always a systematic thinker he loves to hear himself talk he can get carried away with his enthusiasms
7285050 no ordinary joe the politics of the veep pick and what he brings to the party
7285051 but he can also be a motormouth who veers wildly off message

7285133 the manhattan market is still bullish while bears are circling everywhere else
7285134 even with the psychology and pending job loss we have seen signs of it will still be six to nine months before a change is reflected in the prices
7285135 we believe there will be a modest increase in availability as some large financial firms downsize by either electing not to renew certain space or placing a limited amount of space on the sublease market
7285136 leasing activity is down now because there is less available space and a decline in new construction
7285137 it is still the most desirable the most in demand and the most expensive
7285138 if you can find reasonably good property in midtown in a moderate price range
7285139 thats whats renting the best and theres very little left
7285140 its seemingly sustainable nature in spite of big looming questions
7285141 while the impact of the credit crunch has not yet been reflected in our research it is making people skittish
7285142 markets are about psychology and the psychology of this market is clearly worse than the reality of the market
7285143 its going to get better for tenants for the first time in about four years that will be the case
7285144 its surprising that people are locking in at such high numbers when they dont have to
7285145 they should at least wait and see tenants are assuming that things are going to go up and up forever and they never have
7285146 its only 14 units and it has the top finishes of everything
7285147 what if i lift the glass and hold it in front of me
7285148 what if i hold it in this position for an hour
7285149 right and what if i hold it like this the whole day
7285150 it will put huge pressure on your muscles you might have to be hospitalized because of the pain
7285151 and during all that time will there be any difference in the weight of the glass
7285152 put in there the things you love and that will give you a wonderful feeling the minute you get there it can be flowers candles or anything that makes you happy and gives you the opportunity to let go of the glass and rest from holding it for too long

7285159 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
7285160 unless some kind of miracle happens i dont see it
7285161 its not just for me but for the people you drive
7285162 we feel our health benefits and sick leave benefits are competitive and we feel good about it
7285163 very often these are the jobs where people are living very close to the bone
7285164 workers are sometimes putting their jobs on the line because they have a sick child or are sick
7285165 if we live in a society where all adults are working then we need to have a workplace to accommodate that reality
7285166 theres been some concern that employees are abusing the ordinance theres been a little bit of that but not as widespread as people thought at the beginning
7285167 we are communicating to customers around the country making sure that were answering any questions concerning it
7285168 we are finalizing plans that will walk board officials through the process of identifying the problem loading the affected memory cards and verifying that the votes are counted
7285169 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7285170 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7285171 barbarians thats what they are they kill innocent people here how many kilometers outside the battlefield they bombed all over georgia
7285172 it was too hard to start over in a strange place
7285173 somebody gonna do something for me somebody gonna call 911 if i aint got no ride somebody gonna give me a ride if i need some money well they might not loan me no money but theyll give me some conversation
7285174 quite obviously if the country goes into a recession new york city real estate would logically be affected
7285175 that said the perception that real estate in new york city is a better investment than placing money in the stock market continues to be a stated reason for buying for many of our customers
7285176 we have so far not seen much change one way or another in the marketplace
7285177 clearly there has been a large injection of capital into the portfolios of many in the financial industry there is of course some offset of apprehension about the fear of recession and the continued weakness in the national housing market for the moment these two forces seem to be holding one another at bay
7285178 how much time would really depend on how deep the recession goes
7285179 you have to remember that homes are not like stocks their prices cant move as fast the concern over the next few months will be the effect of a possible recession on buyer confidence
7285180 the rise in price and to a lesser extent sales can be attributed to 15 cpw which had more closings in december than november
7285181 also there were closings at the new development 823 park avenue four of which were for over 10 million forty five park avenue also had a lot more closings in december so basically id attribute both increases to new developments
7285182 even with less rental buildings being constructed the lack of demand is almost unprecedented in my 35 years in the business
7285183 landlords across the board are reporting this and only the ones who sharpen their pencils and reduce rents pay fees or offer other incentives are rapidly renting their units
7285184 the market is returning to where it was during the recession of 2001
7285185 thats something to look for as an early warning sign of whats going on
7285186 how can we rule out that life may have developed elsewhere
7285187 just as we consider earthly creatures as a brother and sister why should we not talk about an extraterrestrial brother it would still be part of creation
7285188 the bible doesnt mention aliens therefor they cannot exist if aliens did exist surely that would have been on our need to know list and god would have told us

7285193 the world has not forgotten the people of this land today we are all from gaza
7285194 we recognize that were two humble boats but what weve accomplished is to show that average people from around the world can mobilize to create change we do not have to stay silent in the face of injustice reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
7285195 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing
7285196 what weve done shows that people can do what governments should have done if people stand up against injustice we can truly be the conscience of the world
7285197 all of the factors that may legitimately affect the physical intellectual moral and spiritual well being of the child
7285198 im here firstly for the experience and i will certainly get that if i play regularly in matches like this and travel with the team
7285199 it is what i need really i couldnt get that much at arsenal so i am happy to be here and happy to know im going to get more games than at arsenal
7285200 i dont remember too much about that game except old trafford but i know it was tough that day they were a lot stronger
7285201 niko is out with his ankle but ive still got some good wide players and i wouldnt hesitate to put traore in
7285202 the kid can play and he can certainly run and were looking for a bit of pace
7285203 the only way well have a chance against united is to match their work rate we didnt do that at chelsea and got hammered 4 0 but if we work harder now we can cause united problems
7285204 i had sunderland manchester city newcastle stoke hull and west ham all interested in me its great to know that interest was there
7285205 at first i wanted to stay in london but i prefer portsmouth to west ham because they are the fa cup winners they are in europe and i know people here

7285215 when we were growing out of our fairfax office i looked at prince william and said to my boss hey check this place out
7285216 my boss said it looked like a farm community still but i said here is a financial opportunity to invest in a community i saw the growth that was and would continue to occur out here
7285217 this is a progressive very forward thinking environment and it has really benefited us
7285218 in fairfax and alexandria sometimes you feel like youre more on the outside looking in but here everyone makes you feel like you are part of the community
7285219 there are 12 000 economic development offices across the u s trying to compete for only a handful of business opportunities
7285220 were competitive though and theres no doubt about that we have the right people the right climate and it gets better every day
7285221 you can sniff and stomp your foot and dismiss spong with all sorts of rhetorical flourish
7285222 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
7285223 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
7285224 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
7285225 i briefed the minister about the developments there in vienna
7285226 biden gets a bare majority in his own party to support his selection and women are the least enthusiastic of the demographics tested
7285227 not only has biden not helped obama it looks like hes actually damaging the ticket with his addition
7285228 barack obamas selection of u s sen and former presidential candidate joe biden as his running mate is not generating a momentous immediate reaction from the nations voters just 14 of registered voters interviewed in a new usa today gallup poll say biden makes them more likely to vote for obama in november and 7 say less likely while 72 say he will not have much effect on their vote

7285232 its a sad day for us because were not supposed to be here fighting with our own government
7285233 all my life ive been poor and homeless fighting for the right to be heard and consulted we should be in cape town celebrating the birthday of the united democratic front now not even this constitutional court gives me the comfort that the poor peoples struggle for dignity is over the road of the poor and homeless is long our story is a test for democracy and our constitution and were still struggling
7285234 i dont know why we are here in 2008 fighting about evictions and our right to be heard and holding those in power to promises they make so lightly to the poor

7285239 in recognition of outstanding contributions to the canadian information processing society and to the profession on cips behalf
7285240 i can remember a session in his john peck office when he was describing an area of mathematics known as graph theory and how colouring of these graphs might actually help him produce an exam timetable at that point i got very interested in this particular branch of mathematics and how computers might actually help to solve what was an intractable problem
7285241 i had an administrative appointment chair of the new division of computer science albeit a junior one early on in my career that led to all sorts of interesting experiences and eventually i took other administrative jobs as well as my teaching
7285242 it turns out that our professor had somehow acquired the library of the people that he worked with in london and had brought this library to glasgow there was a book there that was written by charles babbage a very early computer pioneer pre electronic days in the middle of the 1800s and i started flipping through this book i got very interested in this book and the sort of things that charles babbage was trying to do that was really the beginning of my interest in the history of computing purely by accident
7285243 that museum is part of the smithsonian and they had a very early exhibit on computing from about 1980s they decided that they had to refresh this exhibit and to start over again to create a proper exhibit for the then developing information age they were looking around for some help one of their advisors happened to know of me and so i got this phone call one day asking me to come down to talk with them in the end they asked me to arrange with my university to take a leave of absence for about four months to help them get the ideas together and to look over their artifacts and see how they could be arranged into a proper story
7285244 this is the worlds largest collection of computing artifacts if you take everything in the smithsonian in the london science museum in the deutsches museum in germany and a few others and combine then altogether this collection in california is still much larger its everything from tiny microchips to various cray supercomputers that weighed about nine tons and these were all jammed into a number of these leaky warehouses trying to organize the movement of this collection of artifacts into the new building and to arrange them in some sort of way so that we could at least tell a preliminary story was a very interesting task and quite frankly its one that i dont ever want to repeat it was very hard work
7285245 the early days of that journal were basically the computer pioneers discussing their own work the reason for starting the journal was that a lot of these stories were being lost as these people were passing away in particular the inside stories those little interesting anecdotes it has now shifted because there is now a thriving community of technical historians who are writing historical papers for publishing in that journal it has certainly served to preserve some of the stories about the creation of the computer and how it was used in the early days and the journal is now thriving it has a long waiting list for things to be published and has a very lively group of both subscribers and authors
7285246 one of the things they did was to have a series of milestones for example the first electrical power generating plant the things that had been instrumental in the development of technology and the electrical engineering field they would place a suitable plaque on the site one of the things i proposed was to broaden it out from power engineering so that it also included slightly more modern things such as the development of various computing facilities things like the first canadian satellite for radio communication we managed to erect plaques so that the general public could see that there was a historic site in the neighborhood and that might twig their interest to investigate things slightly further
7285247 i think what i found the most interesting about the history of computing was the people this included not only the early pioneers but people like charles babbage and going back as far as 4000 years ago the scribes in egypt who left records of how they actually did computations its the stories of these people rather than the actual physical things they created that i found by far the most interesting
7285248 as i was trying to document the history of computing i would deliberately go out and try to meet the people who had done it and i would try to find out their motivation and contributions in various ways this led to meeting such eminent pioneers as conrad and wilkes there were a lot in canada including kelly gotlieb in toronto and various other people at the university of toronto and another one at the university of saskatoon andrew donald booth all of these people have lived fascinating lives and they were desperate to try to develop computing in some way and each approached it differently they often had almost no resources and the effort that they had to make just to get things started was wonderful lesson in overcoming all sorts of problems
7285249 first of all i love teaching you have to be prepared you have to have plan you have to have examples all prepared and have everything laid out rather than just leaving it to chance that i think is the biggest lesson i learned very early on in my career
7285250 i think there are many many others who deserve these awards and i was suitably humbled to receive them i certainly never expected that i would ever get either one they both came as tremendous surprises
7285251 that was a lesson in trying to look at a large organization and to see where the organization was not as efficient as it could be then to sort out what our actual priorities were and to drop things that werent a first priority in order to get our financial situation back in order the major lesson i took away from that is if you take a job of that nature of course its a volunteer job youve got to be interested in people because it is people who actually do the work all of these are very interesting learning experiences and unfortunately once youve learned them you cant go back and do the job again
7285252 as with other industries various groups have set up certification programs so that people can take these certifications and have some sort of standard that they can compare themselves against it is now beginning to be recognized that there are several different kinds of certifications that are needed different national groups as well as ifip are starting to offer these different kinds of certifications to bring not only those people who classify themselves as software professionals but also the class of it professionals that competes in the day to day business of computing working in industry or business to get them some sort of international recognition from international standards and things like code of ethics i think that the industry is now maturing to the point where these certifications are both necessary and desirable and i hope that this will continue to develop along this line that has been started
7285253 he made very significant changes in words themes and style
7285254 the book should now be credited as by mary shelley with percy shelley
7285255 it seems they were using the same pen and very likely were often writing in bed together
7285256 a pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together
7285257 unable to endure the aspect of the creature i had created
7285258 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7285259 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7285260 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7285261 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7285262 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7285263 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7285264 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7285265 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7285266 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7285267 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7285268 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses

7285277 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7285278 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7285279 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7285280 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7285281 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7285282 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7285283 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7285284 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7285285 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7285286 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7285287 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7285288 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7285289 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7285290 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7285291 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7285292 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7285293 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7285294 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7285295 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7285296 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7285297 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7285298 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

7285302 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7285303 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7285304 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7285305 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7285306 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7285307 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7285308 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7285309 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7285310 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7285311 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7285312 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7285313 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7285314 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7285315 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7285316 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7285317 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7285318 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7285319 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7285320 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7285321 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7285322 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7285323 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7285324 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7285325 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7285326 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7285327 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7285328 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7285329 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7285330 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7285331 this is a planning took where all things are going
7285332 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7285333 he will need to take some stock hell need a couple of weeks the plan is for him to take stock mentally and otherwise and i have advised him he needs to get back onto the field as soon as he can
7285334 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7285335 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7285336 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7285337 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7285338 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7285339 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7285340 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7285341 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7285342 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7285343 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7285344 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7285345 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7285346 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7285347 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7285348 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7285349 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7285350 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7285351 we start every series well we always win the first game and then we mess the next four up
7285352 the key to tonights win is to make sure we focus on tuesday and turn up with the same energy and same buzz i am captain who wants my players to be confident and play without fear and do a proper decent job thats what i do all my life i have been doing that and i think it is rubbing off on some of the lads
7285353 things are working at the moment and it is down to the way the guys have reacted over the last two weeks it was a real turn up for the books that michael did what he did but that was right for michael
7285354 but it is hats off to the lads they have shown such energy and passion the dressing room is such a happy place and that is because we are winning
7285355 there are areas we need to work on and there are some real positives happening in english cricket at the moment
7285356 i could not have asked for more from steve my relationship with him is as strong as anything and he is a happy happy man he is a superstar as well this is the stage he belongs on
7285357 steve wants to play for england and play on the bigger stage and that is where he is performing at the moment
7285358 look billy i think youre not travelling well it might be because of so and so
7285359 against fast bowling my first movement was to move my back foot slightly back and across as i lifted my bat at the moment of delivery my back foot would be covering middle stump and my blade would be approximately the height of the bails from that position it was easy to go back or come forward to a half volley
7285360 no im not going to tell my players what they can say
7285361 well boys weve got rommel tomorrow at el amien do it your way and ill see you at the finish
7285362 without doubt the laws of cricket and the conduct of the game are a great example to the world we should all be proud of this heritage which i trust may forever stand as a beacon light guiding mans footsteps to happy and peaceful days
7285363 misschien houden ze er volgend jaar wel mee op bedacht ik tijdens de terugrit naar het binnenland misschien beramen ze in stilte het afscheid van hun eigen schepping het zou wel mooi kunnen zijn nog n keer een knaleditie de weiden bezaaien met werken van alle kunstenaars die hier ooit aandacht kregen veel pers veel publiek en dan de hele boel in de fik steken een gigantische kunstbrand het ultieme vreugdevuur der ijdelheden het hele dorp van de kaart geschroeid waarna alleen nog as en onkruid en het raam van van vliet en het silhouet van claus als twee mysterieuze meteoren
7285364 i thought it would be a lot more but its only a couple of coffees each week
7285365 anything we do to reduce the carbon footprint of our lifestyle is something we are prepared to do
7285366 because i talked to christy and im here to pack all your shit tonight and you are leaving with them tomorrow
7285367 kk i dont want you to have to deal with that shop tomorrow at all
7285368 whats so damn funny and where is janet putting my bras if i dont die im going to need my bras and my make up bras and make up everything else is priority two
7285369 xbox is a natural partner to help us reach out to youth voters
7285370 to realize our goal of registering 2 million young americans by this fall we need to go where young americans are and theres no doubt in our minds that many are on xbox 360 and xbox live
7285371 were thrilled to partner with rock the vote to make it easier than ever for youth voters and our members to register and be heard
7285372 well i want to make a great presentation to the group
7285373 so youre hoping youll give your talk and therell be a queue of people at the end clamouring for your services
7285374 its something that came out of this office and it reflects on me
7285375 anytime an office has been run by the same people you start to limit ideas it becomes outdated its time for change
7285376 osceola county has already invested in training me and preparing me for this im ready to do the job
7285377 foreign aid might be defined as a transfer of money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries

7285383 si no fuera por la tragedia que vive nicaragua tendr amos que re rnos a carcajadas por su discurso tan c nico y chistoso
7285384 vos ten s gente que est diciendo que el amor es m s fuerte que el odio pero que dice esto con odio

7285389 asociaci n pol tica y militar de car cter ideol gico
7285390 alba conspira contra la libertad de comercio las libertades individuales y la libre determinaci n de la sociedad
7285391 y va en contra de las regulaciones de la organizaci n mundial del comercio de la cual honduras es miembro y de todo lo que representa el libre comercio y la empresa
7285392 est a favor de medidas arbitrarias como la disoluci n de los poderes del estado la confrontaci n permanente con las c pulas empresariales el cuestionamiento de las centrales obreras la precariedad del poder judicial el estrangulamiento de la libertad de prensa y sobre todo la nacionalizaci n de empresas y la promoci n de un exagerado intervencionismo del gobierno
7285393 al firmar el convenio de alba el gobierno declarar la guerra a m s de 1 2 millones de hondure os que residen en estados unidos y que env an casi 3 000 millones de d lares en remesas cada a o a sus familiares y sostienen nuestra econom a y que podr an ser deportados
7285394 no podemos morder la mano del principal socio econ mico estados unidos
7285395 estoy en desacuerdo con las pol ticas del presidente ch vez por eso no acepto una relaci n con un gobernante que no tiene buena aptitud social y si de m depende la adhesi n al alba no va
7285396 nos preocupa mucho que alba es una alianza pol tica militar contra estados unidos lo que es una locura y una tonter a del gobierno
7285397 s es verdad y as debe ser y proporcionamos ayuda de transporte y alimentos porque el partido tiene derecho a movilizar su gente
7285398 es el pitcher con el que hemos contado todo el a o sus n meros son realmente satisfactorios y estamos complacidos de su trabajo
7285399 todos se han lesionado y l fue uno de los pocos que se mantuvo saludable e incluso en varias ocasiones se arriesg lanzando con dolor
7285400 chucky cheese is a bad place to take a child who is afraid of costumed characters
7285401 enry eess the one that did it eess the one
7285402 henry he is the one that did it he is the one
7285403 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7285404 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7285405 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7285406 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7285407 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7285408 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7285409 people have been observant of the downturns that happen in certain industries
7285410 they want to choose a career that will let them provide for their families without seeing layoffs or downsizing
7285411 there are certain jobs that serve basic needs and those needs arent going to change
7285412 that makes them less sensitive to changes in the economy
7285413 adult education actually increases during hard times because people find themselves out of work and are looking to improve their skills
7285414 people are always going to get sick so theyre always going to need health care
7285415 we have a violent crime problem in the city of allentown and the police department is woefully understaffed in the departments that investigative these crimes
7285416 there are a lot of crimes that are not being investigated like white collar crimes such as embezzlement because the department lacks the resources and the experience
7285417 this put the city in fiscal jeopardy and severe jeopardy in public safety
7285418 we have a violent crime problem in the city of allentown and the police department is woefully understaffed in the departments that investigate these crimes
7285419 uh yes apparently i need an appointment because i just peed on two pregnancy sticks and they are both positive
7285420 its a time of year when people are a bit more susceptible
7285421 theyll say would you like to come down to the voter registration office
7285422 davis said of course unsuspecting consumers not wanting to be bothered to go to the courthouse then give out personal information that can compromise their identity he said
7285423 i think this is going to be a wonderful campus
7285424 theyve been tremendous assets to us the brothers of christian instruction owner of the school building and the city of plattsburgh
7285425 were excited for a chance to step up and put in our delegations votes for barack obama the next president of the united states
7285426 its a historic time at the end we had two very historic candidates and so its going to be a historic convention on the heels of that
7285427 this was one of those occasions where people got to choose between the greater of several goods rather than between the lesser of several evils
7285428 i think were poised to have a great november nationally and in particular in iowa its just getting people to keep their eye on the ball
7285429 it is a very diverse delegation in every way that you can think of
7285430 its both old and new people who have been around awhile as well as a lot of new faces
7285431 its a much broader group of folks every campaign brought new people into the process
7285432 i know of many middleage and older people who have always voted and are real solid citizens but never got involved until this year
7285433 with my background in american culture theres nothing like a live performance and im very eager to see it that way
7285434 many things about the convention will be different and my innate curiosity is piqued it will be very special
7285435 i think the democrats are in a very precarious position
7285436 i think theyre doing their best to downplay any kind of those divisions but eventually at some point i fully expect its going to come out
7285437 one of the biggest parties in the world attended by the worlds biggest superstar
7285438 the conventions are very important for defining who you are
7285439 obamas got to use this time to lay out who he is in some way that connects with average americans so its extremely important for him
7285440 politicians always will tell you that the election that theyre talking about is the most important election thatyoull ever see do you know why they say that they say that because theyre on the ballot
7285441 well i aint on the ballot but it is the most important election that ive ever seen in my adult lifetime
7285442 there are so many things that are at risk so many things at stake so many things that need to be changed that business as usual is not good enough we need to make some changes in this country that are long long overdue
7285443 most of the pollutants cause asthma like symptoms shortness of breath tightness in the chest coughing just general irritation in the breathing passages in the lungs theyre lung irritants is what they are
7285444 with energy prices the way they are the main thing any consumer can do is be more efficient with their use of energy because the less energy you use especially if its electricity the less power plant emissions you get being more efficient about the trips you take in your automobile so you have less pollution out of the tailpipe and just conserving energy will save you money and help the environment too
7285445 used to the ozone was generally a metropolitan problem but with the science getting better and the epa tightening the standard we can have ozone problems anywhere in the state
7285446 the fuels are getting cleaner the cars are getting cleaner things are being done out of state to reduce their impact on oklahoma and our factories are getting cleaner
7285447 the only thing we can help you with is food
7285448 we spent 900 for food alone in the past week and were only open three mornings a week
7285449 weve had a lot of people coming in for food and clothes it seems like the need increases every week
7285450 some cant meet their higher mortgage rates have been laid off because of the economy or are just normal people who dont receive enough to live on
7285451 weve surpassed last year and weve still got more than four months to go
7285452 it doesnt make sense for people to be driving all over the county for small amounts of food
7285453 id settle for any flavor and it might be rocky road
7285454 not as much fun in person as they might seem
7285455 would all probably be staying at the bunny ranch in nevada and commute
7285456 several times we saw applications for credit cards pacific gas and electric company nyse pcg bills and applications for an apartment rental
7285457 that he expects to have arthroscopic surgery after the season to remove a painful bone spur in his right shoulder
7285458 de tijd is onbelangrijk maar ik had wel iets meer verwacht dan een klassering bij de beste veertig
7285459 het waren zestien glorieuze dagen die we voor altijd zullen koesteren
7285460 als je iets wilt winnen loop dan de 100 meter wil je iets ervaren loop dan de marathon
7285461 obamas overall lead in the new poll is attributable in large measure to a nearly 20 point advantage among female voters he trails mccain by nine points among men
7285462 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7285463 jesus walter you did it again not everything is about vietnam fuck
7285464 we believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed
7285465 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder to please contact police with any information you may have
7285466 the incident happened close to a well lit bus garage in walthamstow central
7285467 he was lovely funny and gentle i have no idea why somebody would want to do something like this
7285468 he was caring and laid back and he had a very close family he was a family boy the people who have done this can run but they cant hide and hopefully justice will be done
7285469 i just had the call early this morning to say what happened and were going to pay our respects to the family
7285470 if they see more officers about then maybe it will deter the gangs from coming into this area
7285471 a chronic structural deficit that shows no sign of improving
7285472 when we see a budget problem developing during the year we dont have any way to stop it
7285473 we just keep the spending accelerator to the floor we need an alternative to crashing
7285474 its such a tragic story and the way the family has bounced back and how the michigan family has wrapped their arms around them makes us feel special
7285475 we moved him over from defensive line to offensive line because of those injuries and not only that because we also think john has a chance to compete for a starting job for this year
7285476 we wouldnt have moved him if we didnt think it because he was in the rotation at d line in two or three days hes such a smart guy and competitive guy weve really been impressed with him
7285477 esta comunica o de uso exclusivo de nossos parceiros n o deve ser exibida ao cliente

7285480 but when i left ohio state was the only school i ever considered
7285481 youre not going to let justin go to ohio state are you
7285482 you dont let him go to ohio state tell him where to go
7285483 that was definitely something in the back of my mind
7285484 hes a first class guy and down to earth coach bollman is the same way
7285485 one of the toughest things ive ever done was telling coach tressel i was going to michigan i loved those guys so much and had become so close
7285486 players want to be coached and have somebody take them to a different level than they can take themselves
7285487 you think youre giving it your all but your coach knows what you can do and what you can offer
7285488 boren got yelled at like everybody else even though his dad played for bo
7285489 was it my first choice hell no but i could have gotten acquainted
7285490 when i get done with college football ill let it out
7285491 tressel and his staff coach with class and emphasize education
7285492 they put whats most important first each player is important theres no bashing of players youre not going to be belittled each player has feelings they treat each person with respect
7285493 i was hoping rodriguez would keep some of his assistants
7285494 as soon as i got my release papers i contacted ohio state and they welcomed me with open arms
7285495 he thrives on that the more michigan boos him the harder hell work

7285637 those of us who are living with hiv and have come to terms with that diagnosis in terms of our own ability to survive the traumas of our diagnosis and daily fight for our rights to existence
7285638 we must seek a cure and a vaccine because lifelong triple drug therapy for the currently infected will already require 990 million patient years of haart to be administered over the next 30 years and if unaids is right that 2 7 million new infections are going to occur every year in the next 20 30 years then we will need another 81 million people who will need 30 years of haart which would be 2 43 billion patient years of haart now that is starting to be a lot of tons of molecules and it is going to be very hard to deliver it so we need massive investment on a cure not just lip service and not just reinserting it into our talks at meetings and we need better prevention methods and combination prevention methods to end the epidemic we must continue to accelerate current scale up and we must scale up faster we are still way behind the epidemic
7285639 i was very disturbed by this conference by not addressing tb as a priority by only having one session on tb on sunday the whole eight days there is no mention on tb while i come from a region where tb is one of the number one killers and i am mentioning that because people live with hiv there is only one percent of people with hiv who are diagnosed early of tb our workforce in south africa is dying of multidrug resistant tb so for me i do not see a future if we do not start stepping up diagnosis and better treatment for tb today
7285640 unfortunately the current campaign for universal access was built without global targets because unaids dfid and the us government refuse to accept them i was at those meetings i heard them speak at the same time the definition of universal access is so now irresponsibly vague just take a look at the latest unaids report which contains more twists and turns than an olympic gymnast to avoid any concrete commitments the decision not to include global targets and to step back from specificity is a political one taken by organisations and agencies that are political to a large if not complete degree but that is really a poor and pathetic excuse and one with potentially devastating public health consequences unless we have clear targets with clear timelines we will never reach our goal of universal access

7285651 but i dont care i have told the mongolian government that i want to buy a piece of land there and move to mongolia i dont mind even giving up my malaysian citizenship and settle down in mongolia so i dont care what they want to do to me
7285652 it is not that im scared it is just that the court case is going on so it would be sub judice for me to talk about the issue plus as the mongolian consel i need to be professional and not simply talk
7285653 what seven or eight people you mean altantuya was not the only one murdered and dumped at that site
7285654 those two utk are assassins their job is to get rid of people and that murder site is the place where they get rid of the bodies by blowing them up

7285661 stata una gara soddisfacente questo il nostro passo di gara siamo lontani dagli altri ma riusciamo a tenere eravamo partiti abbastanza bene ha aggiunto ma poi ho avuto un problema con un sacchetto di plastica che non sono riuscito a evitare e che finito sotto la macchina stato molto pericoloso non mi mai successo del genere

7285739 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7285740 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 cast iron damage proof
7285741 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7285742 it might be something innocuous such as what time is my car coming or when am i going to the hairdresser but the fact she needed to repeat them opened a new and frightening chapter in our lives
7285743 thats the worst thing about dementia it gets you every time
7285744 sufferers look and act the same but beneath the familiar exterior something quite different is going on
7285745 not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7285746 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7285747 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7285748 hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7285749 as if her dementia had sharpened her powers of long term recall
7285750 i want to know how god created this world i am not interested in this or that phenomenon in the spectrum of this or that element i want to know his thoughts the rest are details
7285751 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
7285752 never give up until the project is buried so they can dance on its grave
7285753 gunns is in trouble they are looking for a foreign venture partner
7285754 weve gone from being characterized as environmental terrorists to being embraced this is like falling down a rabbit hole i feel like alice in wonderland
7285755 its been unbelievable to me that this has happened but this isnt my victory i just sat on guard
7285756 we hope to duplicate the things we do well one county away
7285757 the intent is to operate with a high standard of environmental stewardship
7285758 having a healthy well stocked forest will be a good investment over the long term
7285759 theres a lot about rocket science thats been figured out but forests are subject to the intricate web of life the interactions of plants animals sun air you name it
7285760 they dont often think about their land and actively make plans for it because on a day to day basis it meets their needs
7285761 when that dust settles in 20 or 30 years well see what we have left in terms of forests and what ecosystem benefits they still provide
7285762 we bought it because we really believed that rather than being developed it should be open land for us and others to enjoy
7285763 were happy with what weve done and we think it was the right thing to do in terms of helping the environment
7285764 its whether or not the public has a right to be involved
7285765 the no 1 priority for the bush administration aside from logging has been to reduce public accountability
7285766 the united states seeks to shield from judicial review certain rules that bar the public from participation in federal management decisions affecting national forests
7285767 bensmans preclusion from participation in the appeals process may yield diminished recreational enjoyment of the national forests
7285768 because environmental injuries and hardships become imminent only to the extent an environment disturbing project is proposed factual challenges to rules based on theories of environmental damage are seldom justifiable
7285769 it would be a shame if something were to happen to our phone service like an explosion or something
7285770 may i please have a cell phone that doesnt suck as bad as this one sucks
7285771 lady you better give me a cell phone that doesnt suck before i kick you in the nuts
7285772 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7285773 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7285774 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7285775 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7285776 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7285777 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7285778 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7285779 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7285780 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7285781 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7285782 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7285783 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7285784 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7285785 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7285786 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7285787 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7285788 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7285789 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7285790 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7285791 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7285792 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7285793 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7285794 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7285795 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7285796 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7285797 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7285798 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7285799 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7285800 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7285801 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7285802 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7285803 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7285804 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7285805 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7285806 there is no right more fundamental to a free society than the free practice of religion behind walls of prisons and persecuted before our very eyes in places like china iran burma sudan north korea and saudi arabia are tens of thousands of people whose only crime is to worship god in their own way as president i intend to make religious freedom a subject of great importance for the united states in our relations with other nations i will work in close concert with democratic allies to raise the prominence of religious freedom in every available forum whether in bilateral negotiations or in various multinational organizations to which america belongs i will make respect for the basic principle of religious freedom a priority in international relations
7285807 that denies religious freedom can ever rightly claim to be good in some other way and no person can ever be true to any faith that believes in the dignity of all human life if they do not act out of concern for those whose dignity is assailed because of their faith
7285808 ich hoffe und denke dass sie das mitbekommt ich bin kein abergl ubischer typ aber ich w nsche mir dass es so ist
7285809 f r den hass ist kein platz in dieser welt das k nnen wir sportler zeigen
7285810 wenn die welt daraus eine lektion lernen soll dann die dass wir im 21 jahrhundert leben und es nie mehr krieg geben sollte
7285811 als damals lotta geboren wurde musste ich meiner frau versprechen dass ich bei den olympischen spielen eine medaille hole
7285812 er hat sehr gro en anteil an dieser medaille ich habe w hrend des rennens immer an ihn gedacht
7285813 er hat mir wohl auch das regenwetter geschenkt weil ich die hitze nicht so mag das war guter beistand von oben
7285814 damals war nicht klar dass ich heute berhaupt noch leben w rde jetzt bin ich olympiasieger
7285815 seit ich sechs bin tr ume ich von olympia dass ich mein bein verloren habe hat nie etwas daran ge ndert
7285816 ich gehe weit weg ich m chte dass du wenjun wie deine tochter behandelst und ihr hilfst das beste zu geben
7285817 mein kind dein vater begl ckw nscht dich du bist immer der stolz im herzen deines vaters aber jetzt empfindet dein vater zu viel schande um dich zu treffen kannst du das verstehen
7285818 sie sind selbst ein tiefflieger sie sind ganz sch n einfach gestrickt und berdies heftig gehirngesp lt
7285819 olympia ging mir total am allerwertesten vorbei als der geistige tiefflieger outet
7285820 detr s de las compras o nacionalizaciones est la concepci n ideol gica de que s lo el estado es capaz de resolver los problemas del pa s y es el principal art fice de la transformaci n social
7285821 las nacionalizaciones de este a o pueden costarle al pa s m s de 10 850 millones de d lares y cuando se suma a lo que se pag el a o pasado por cantv las compa as el ctricas y las compensaciones que otorg pdvsa a sus socios estamos hablando de una cantidad que ronda los 20 000 millones de d lares
7285822 qued demostrado que no es el sector privado el que va a poder solucionar el problema habitacional sino que es el estado y el poder de las comunidades quienes lo lograr n
7285823 con las nacionalizaciones y las leyes habilitantes ahora se pretende construir un estatismo colectivo y militar como estaba previsto en la reforma constitucional que fue rechaza en el referendo del 2 de diciembre
7285824 no se puede hablar de un regreso al capitalismo de estado y por eso digo que hugo ch vez trata de revivir al mao que los chinos intentan olvidar
7285825 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7285826 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7285827 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7285828 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7285829 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7285830 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7285831 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7285832 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7285833 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7285834 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7285835 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7285836 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7285837 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7285838 this student is in this program and can register for this course
7285839 honey when ive had three mds look at that record and say their shots are current im not listening to an rn say theyre not especially when the last md to review the record did so two days ago
7285840 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7285841 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7285842 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7285843 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7285844 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7285845 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7285846 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7285847 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7285848 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7285849 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7285850 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7285851 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7285852 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7285853 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7285854 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7285855 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7285856 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7285857 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7285858 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7285859 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7285860 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7285861 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7285862 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7285863 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7285864 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7285865 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7285866 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7285867 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7285868 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7285869 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7285870 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7285871 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7285872 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7285873 only go back to areas that have been cleared of mines and declared safe by authorities
7285874 idps originating from villages and other areas not yet cleared by the authorities should be patient and to refrain from returning as yet
7285875 unhcr observed mine clearing actions and the re establishment of georgian police control over the town
7285876 whether or not our next president and congress dismantle empire usa plus turning things around here at home
7285877 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7285878 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7285879 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7285880 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7285881 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7285882 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7285883 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7285884 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7285885 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7285886 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7285887 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7285888 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7285889 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7285890 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7285891 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7285892 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7285893 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7285894 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7285895 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7285896 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7285897 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7285898 right now more than ever we just cant afford insert here
7285899 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7285900 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7285901 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7285902 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7285903 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7285904 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7285905 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7285906 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7285907 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7285908 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7285909 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7285910 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7285911 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
7285912 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
7285913 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7285914 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7285915 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7285916 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7285917 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7285918 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7285919 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7285920 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7285921 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7285922 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7285923 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7285924 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7285925 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7285926 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7285927 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7285928 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7285929 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7285930 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7285931 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7285932 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7285933 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7285934 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7285935 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7285936 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7285937 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7285938 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7285939 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7285940 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7285941 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7285942 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7285943 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7285944 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7285945 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7285946 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7285947 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7285948 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7285949 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7285950 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7285951 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7285952 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7285953 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7285954 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7285955 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7285956 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7285957 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7285958 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7285959 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7285960 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7285961 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7285962 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7285963 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7285964 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7285965 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7285966 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7285967 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7285968 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7285969 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7285970 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7285971 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7285972 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7285973 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7285974 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7285975 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7285976 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7285977 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7285978 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7285979 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7285980 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7285981 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7285982 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7285983 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7285984 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7285985 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7285986 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7285987 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7285988 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7285989 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7285990 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7285991 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7285992 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7285993 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7285994 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7285995 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7285996 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7285997 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7285998 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7285999 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7286000 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7286001 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7286002 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7286003 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7286004 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7286005 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7286006 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7286007 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7286008 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7286009 ive gotten like 30 invitations in the mail just today
7286010 this is a really important convention maybe the most important in the last two decades
7286011 its about taking the candidacy of the first woman and the first african american and blending them in to make sure what we have is the first office the presidency
7286012 i look forward to participating in one of the most historic conventions in american history
7286013 i truly believe this particular convention is the culmination of a democratic liberal agenda that has been in the shadows of a conservative movement for the last 30 years the liberal progressive agenda died with robert f kennedy i see obama picking up the torch again
7286014 weve been schooled as to what we can go to legally and what we cant go to what kind of food you can have what kind of food you cant have
7286015 and weve been schooled in the gray areas as well it will have an effect on individual congressmen and individual senators and it should
7286016 that does not impact one iota how anybody votes people are not swayed by a breakfast where you might pick up a bagel and a cup of coffee
7286017 people are swayed if over a period of time its lunch dinner breakfast trips and the like and thats something thats now excluded

7286024 we need to take a bolder policy agenda to meet peoples material concerns and thats why this policy resonates across the social spectrum
7286025 there are millions of people suffering from fuel poverty and its the job of a labour government to tackle that

7286046 the event is all about giving special children a special day there were 85 truckers in the convoy today with a deserving child in each
7286047 apart from the early bad weather it was absolutely fantastic it was really surprising to see the number of people waving from the streets as we went past despite the rain
7286048 the kids love the size of the trucks and the support and attention from the public
7286049 we raise funds throughout the year to pay for the event just to give children an enjoyable day a multitude of truckers have taken part this year and they enjoy it as much as the children
7286050 gli economisti sovietici solevano dire che se il mondo fosse diventato comunista avrebbero dovuto lasciare in vita almeno un paese capitalista in modo da avere unidea di quali fossero i prezzi reali dei beni e copiarli

7286148 my opponents mandate attacks the very foundation of our system calling for radical ideas which will divide organized real estate and threaten the progress we have made as a profession to date and undermine the mls system
7286149 i do not plan to tamper or radically change our agent mls system our mls system forms the backbone of our mls marketplace and its protection has been trebs number 1 priority for many years my plan calls for us to make change to our data that appears on the public mls ca website that will create a fair marketplace for all our agents and not just benefit agents that have property listed for sale i dont think that being fair to all treb members is a radical idea my opponent is misrepresenting my intentions in order to create fear among the membership the idx concept that i am proposing has to do with the fair use of our data on mls ca and has nothing to do with the operation of our mls system most consumers and even some treb members are confused about the differences between mls ca and our mls system i have been deeply involved with our mls system and the public mls ca i do understand the differences real estate board idxs have already been made available in london ontario and in bc they have been well received by member agents in those regions
7286150 if the past 10 years of a prosperous market has taught us anything it is to
7286151 if we only look to the past and dont look to see were we are currently headed we will make no changes whatsoever
7286152 it is a well known fact that in the majority of cases it is the co operating salesperson who sells the listing while there are cases on double enders this is not with high frequency
7286153 a study from 2003 of 2100 sales in the toronto area shows that 24 of those sales were multiple representation sales of which 9 were what we would call true double enders 24 leads to a lot of confusion and 9 leads to a lot of conflict of interest while i was a director of the mtc develops and operates mls ca i was amazed at how many respected canadian realtors thought that confusing the consumers was good for our business i for one do not believe confusing consumers is good for our business
7286154 mls ca is an excellent tool for the consumer and its sole objective is for the purposes of advertising the listing it is the listing broker who incurs the marketing and advertising costs etc and it would be counterproductive and divisive to alter what mls ca site stands for
7286155 mls ca is an excellent tool for the consumers but it could be so much better mls ca is an advertising web site paid for equally by all realtors and populated by data that belongs equally to all realtors yet only agents with active listings get the benefits this is not fair also using mls in the name degrades the value of our true mls system especially for buyer agents mls ca now stands for confusion and unfairness and i believe that if we dont do something about this soon we will see many problems arise for our industry looking out the rear window is not a leadership solution it is mls ca that is structured to perform in a divisive way i understand there are those who feel that making mls ca fair to all is not in their own best interest as they are the current beneficiaries of the unfairness
7286156 treb has one mls rule regarding offers and that says for a property to be on our mls system it must be available for offers reco has one rule regarding multiple offers and that says that if there are multiple offers you have to inform all agents with offers how many there are thats it for our industry standards regarding multiple offers
7286157 when i raced motorcycles i learned not to look backwards too much one time i spent too long looking backwards wondering what had happened to my competitor who i had just passed for 1st place he had some mechanical problem when i looked up i was headed straight for a gravel pile at 80 mph this was not good i believe that to keep ahead of our competitors and to keep on track we have to understand the past see where we are now have some vision of a better future

7286159 the restaurants owners hired andersen consulting to revamp all our processes after several months of analysis they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery it represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour if our staff are better prepared we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man hours per shift
7286160 ill get another spoon next time i go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now
7286161 excuse me but can you tell me why you have that string right there
7286162 not everyone is so observant that consulting firm i mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest room by tying this string to the tip of you know what we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands shortening the time spent in the rest room by 76 39 per cent

7286171 a gesture like this from the gaa would do far more than all the talk in the world to advance the cause of ireland for which collins and dev and all our patriots fought to achieve
7286172 we must consign to the scrapheap any semblance of bitterness and poison that might still remain after the civil war
7286173 we must realise that collins and dev had far more in common than divided them and that the politics of meanness begrudgery and division do not serve the free ireland that our forefathers fought to achieve
7286174 i often took inspiration and spiritual guidance from the sacrifices of collins and his colleagues when the going got tough collins got going

7286223 unable to sell her aurora town home for what she owes on it judith smith is looking for someone to take over her mortgage three years ago smith said townhomes like hers sold for 140 000 and up but a nearby foreclosure is on the market for 99 000 even if she could sell for the 115 000 she owes on her mortgage smith said she wouldnt be able to cover the 6 900 in commissions to agents on each side of a sale
7286224 smiths predicament is becoming more common as falling home values make it increasingly difficult for home owners to sell without bringing money to the table
7286225 investors are able to buy homes that sold for 140 000 two years ago for 55 000 now said charles roberts a broker with who has sold about 45 homes for less than 100 000 in the last 12 months
7286226 like a growing number of utahns these days she is struggling to keep her house she is also among the many who feel a sense of shame to find themselves in such a perilous position so much so that she asked that her identity not be revealed a salt lake resident she paid her bills and worked hard spending 14 years in the retail business so that she could buy a home
7286227 but her fortunes changed due to some serious health problems and she was swept into a scam she fell behind on her mortgage payments and soon was at risk of losing her home to foreclosure
7286228 i got so far behind on my house because i couldnt afford it she said
7286229 we have really gone in the tank since then said james wood director of the university of utahs bureau of economic and business research new building permits in major cities since 2007 are down about 60 percent
7286230 weve really fallen off the edge in the last nine months wood said the last three quarters have been the three worst consecutive quarters ever for housing growth in utah
7286231 taz biesinger executive vp of the utah home builders association said it may take 10 years for home construction to reach the 2007 levels if we ever get there again
7286232 he said the artificial demand came from investors who thought they were going to flip homes by buying them at low prices improving them and reselling them
7286233 wood said that more than 50 000 high risk subprime mortgages were issued in utah between 2004 and 2007 a good deal of those people would not qualify for mortgages in past markets he said
7286234 a high concentration of foreclosures continued to pull home prices down last month across the valleys existing home market according to the latest arizona state university report
7286235 foreclosure activity represented 42 percent or 3 470 of the 8 165 transactions that took place last month
7286236 the lower median price is being impacted by several forces including the large number of vacant homes especially in certain neighborhoods said jay butler director of realty studies at asus morrison school of management and agribusiness at the polytechnic campus
7286237 the median price including foreclosures in scottsdale was 450 000 compared to 501 135 in june and 595 500 in july 2007 the prevalence of foreclosures is hurting the market said janine brown president of the scottsdale area association of realtors
7286238 i dont think that we have seen that type of number for a while she said
7286239 talking to some executives at lake havasu citys community banks you get the feeling theyre in the business of lending optimism as well as money people business really need some good news ralph tapscott ceo of mohave state bank said
7286240 he thinks he has some housing inventories are down and sales are up in the hard hit las vegas market
7286241 but the fallout from the mortgage crisis caused both residential and commercial construction to slow or in some cases come to a halt and that has been a hit to the community banks which did a lot of construction lending they were probably financing the strip mall or the restaurant that was going along with the booming housing market thats pretty much across the state said tanya wheeless ceo of the arizona bankers association
7286242 until august 2007 horizon community bank then in business for five years had never held a loan that was 30 days or more past due said ceo dennis van by november more delinquencies began to crop up he said
7286243 in february horizons leadership made the decision to set aside 1 1 million in reserves for potential losses van said were by far not hurting weve changed our focus weve changed our focus from bucking and kicking to maybe working out more loans van said
7286244 van said sometimes that expertise means knowing when to discourage a customer we dont want to help our customers hurt themselves for our perspective saying no is a good thing in this environment he said
7286245 in spite of the obvious challenges the current economy has posed for local banks their top executives convey a sense of groundedness almost as if theyre relieved the high flying days over
7286246 i think everybody needed to catch their breath van said
7286247 home sales are making a comeback in las vegas and inventory has been reduced to about an eight month supply but prices continue their free fall from a year ago a strong signal that the housing market has yet to enter recovery
7286248 salestraq reported 3 173 existing home closings in july a 56 5 percent increase from the same month a year ago and the highest monthly total since september 2006 however 61 percent of those sales were bank owned homes with a median price of 193 000 dragging the overall median existing home price down 23 9 percent from a year ago to 210 000
7286249 new home sales slumped to just 731 in july down 57 5 percent from july 2007 for the year new home sales have fallen 47 9 percent to 6 248 units median prices fell 20 4 percent to 262 185
7286250 its getting depressing out there salestraq president larry murphy said
7286251 the number of foreclosures edged up to 2 281 in july up 8 4 percent from june according to salestraq
7286252 foreclosure sales in las vegas were about 85 percent of the number of new foreclosures thats one benchmark for recovery murphy said when we get to the point where the banks are selling more than they acquire then and only then will we be in a recovery mode he said
7286253 in the past three months las vegas has averaged more than 2 600 closings a month
7286254 reducing the supply of existing homes is crucial to the recovery of the new home market which continues to slump julys 731 sales were the fewest in any month this decade and were down 58 percent from july 2007 murphy said
7286255 new home sales have surpassed 1 000 only one month this year in march
7286256 builders continued to drop prices in july with new homes going for a median price of 252 990 about 2 300 less than the end of the second quarter the price is nearly 20 percent below july 2007s 314 993
7286257 the new and mid rise condo market had its weakest month of the year in july with 73 closings thats the fewest since 61 in december the median price for all new homes in july including condos fell to 262 185 the lowest its been this year thats a drop of nearly 8 000 from june
7286258 county officials knew about the informal hotel operation since its beginning claims michael mackenzie who helped run it and the county had agreed to tolerate it on the condition the meridian eventually went through the required procedures according to mackenzie who was voted off the meridian homeowners board this week
7286259 the county wednesday flatly denied mackenzies version of events the first time that we became aware of an issue of short term rentals happening at the property was this spring when we started getting inquiries from the media and meridian owners county spokeswoman stacey welling said
7286260 mackenzie who does not personally own a meridian unit is a vice president of american invsco the chicago based company that converted the meridian from apartments to condos in 2005
7286261 angry owners of units at the financially troubled meridian turned mackenzie out of office on monday night many believe he misled them on the hotel which he helped launch in summer 2007 the meridian is now taking steps to legally reopen the hotel
7286262 when the meridians hotel ceased the well went dry for unit owners who were leasing out their units through a rental program affiliated with american invsco they have received no rent checks since june many unit owners counted on the rental income to cover the cost of their meridian mortgages
7286263 about 80 of the 678 units at the upscale property are now in foreclosure mackenzie estimated monday he said he was bitter toward kathleen mannix the owner who went to the county and the review journal in spring unlike most unit owners mannix lives year round at the meridian and paid in full for her modest studio
7286264 about 400 of the meridians estimated 450 owners are in some degree of financial distress now or soon according to scott oelke a real estate agent who owns a unit at the meridian
7286265 today we take the hoa homeowners association for ourselves owner frank taddeo a local resident shouted at an informal meeting of owners on monday afternoon many had flown in from out of town to attend
7286266 welling could not say when the countys audit of meridians unremitted room taxes will be ready but when the audit which is looking for missed taxes from june 2007 through june 2008 is complete welling said the county licensing department has 30 days in which to bill the final amount to meridian by executive location which is the entity that has applied for the transient lodging status required to run a hotel

7286355 que es lo que te motiva a invertir tanto tiempo en difamar una empresa cuando no se si has aunque sea probado los productos o conocido a alguien que los haya utilizado corectamnte
7286356 y cuando vemos que conocidos nuestros ganan buen dinero vendiendo esto y que han perdido mucho peso al igual que sus conocidos que hacemos tenemos que negar la realidad evidentemente hay gente que no cree en su capacidad no est entusiasmada y en la primera senasci n de fracaso abandonan el negocio o usan mal los productos yy despu s culpan a la empresa de perder dinero o tiempo jajaja y la gente que le sirve el producto o la que vive de esto honestamente

7286359 there is a possibility that diet can affect ones risk of pancreatic as well as other cancers
7286360 and that eating a diet rich in a wide variety of grains is likely to not only help in the prevention of diabetes and heart disease but also this very deadly cancer
7286361 tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
7286362 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
7286363 the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 are still at large russia has invaded the sovereign nation of georgia iran is pursuing nuclear weapons
7286364 the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the ceasefire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
7286365 we have lost over a thousand american lives and spent hundreds of billions of dollars since the surge began but iraqs leaders still havent made hard compromises or substantial investments in rebuilding their country
7286366 and while we pay a heavy price in iraq and americans pay record prices at the government is sitting on a 79 billion dollar budget surplus from windfall oil profits
7286367 iraqi inaction threatens the progress weve made and creates an opening for iran and the special groups it supports
7286368 its time to press the iraqis to take responsibility for their future the best way to do that is a responsible redeployment of our combat brigades carried out in close consultation with commanders on the ground
7286369 after this redeployment well keep a residual force to target remnants of al qaeda to protect our service members and diplomats and to train iraqs security forces if the iraqis make political progress
7286370 strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan
7286371 this is a war that we have to win and as commander in chief i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america and finishing the job against the taliban
7286372 so for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
7286373 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
7286374 we have to work with musharraf because the biggest threat to american security right now is in the northwest provinces of pakistan
7286375 we should continue to give him military aid contingent on him doing something about that
7286376 senator mccain and i both strongly support the people of georgia
7286377 some democrats have been pleading with obama to use mccains tough response to the russian invasion of georgia to paint him as a trigger happy interventionist who would risk bringing a war weary nation into military conflict in regions where the united states has no interest
7286378 gak masalah kok gue yakin semua itu ada hikmah dan maksud tertentu yang sudah ditakdirkan gue yakin sekarang dia ada ditangan yang lebih kuasa memberi nikmat dan kasih sayang yang maha besar gue cukup bahagia bisa menyelimuti anak gue yang baru lahir ini walaupun gue gak pernah dengar suara tangisnya gue yakin dia bersuara merdu walaupun sekarang wajahnya pucat gue yakin dia sebetulnya punya wajah yang cantik dan walaupun badannya dingin gue yakin dia bisa memberi kehangatan di dalam keluarga gue masalahnya cuma gue mungkin belum dipercaya punya momongan secantik ini gue iklhas

7286520 cuando uno visita estos barrios hoy ve que hay agua estancada en las cunetas eso sucede por varios factores a veces los vecinos tienen conectados all los pozos negros otras veces son cunetas de tierra y el crecimiento de los pastizales impide que el agua corra y en la mayor a de los casos tiene que ver con residuos que se esparcen en la v a p blica y que van a parar al desag e ahora se va a limpiar el desag e y se le va a dar la pendiente adecuada para que el agua vaya al troncal y de all a los reservorios

7286562 in the case of parents who have medical evidence that they may have a very disabled child i would not want to change that
7286563 and i speak as someone i mean ive got a six year old boy who is severely disabled has cerebral palsy and is quadriplegic and hes a sweet boy hes a lovely boy ivan and you know it is though incredibly tough bringing up disabled children and i dont want to kind of put myself in the position of saying to other parents youve got to go ahead and have that child or you cant have an abortion or you can do this or you cant do that
7286564 personally ivan hes brought incredible things to my life but it is an enormous challenge and i dont think its right to sort of tell other parents if you hear that youve got a very disabled child on the way that actually doing something about it isnt an option thats my view

7286581 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have

7286584 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7286585 he doesnt sugarcoat hes going to be absolutely invaluable in standing up to mccain and his running mate
7286586 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7286587 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds
7286588 you talk about how much youre worried about paying the bills thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about
7286589 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7286593 he adds experience foreign policy weight catholic working class roots and an aggressive campaign style
7286594 a few gaffes are likely to be more than balanced by his ability to challenge mccains judgment on national security matters
7286595 finally while senator schumers statements may have accelerated public concern about indymacs financial condition we do not believe that we can prove that they caused the banks failure

7286597 the goal for each of the parties at these conventions is to create a huge propaganda moment
7286598 that demonstrates the values they represent and the leadership qualities of their candidates
7286599 the extra points added by the convention comprise the bounce and size matters
7286600 major slippage is bound to occur think 18 wheeler highway wreck squared
7286601 the two f words for democrats will be family and flag
7286602 obama has to erase any doubts about his religion his values his readiness and his patriotism and he has to show that the obamas are the ultimate american family
7286603 there has never been an election cycle like this one its literally light years from what it was four years ago and that has to do with the relentless scrutiny of the internet
7286604 today these conventions involve so many little nuanced things and everything every word that is uttered can be interpreted in myriad ways its just relentless
7286605 issues of central concern to the family and the home
7286606 a return to the clinton years and the clinton values
7286607 the republicans are united at the moment and democrats still have a lingering hillary hangover
7286608 fire up their supporters to be for obama then it will unite the party and hell get that bump
7286609 its their job to inspire the people that were supporting hillary to rally behind barack then obama has to close the deal with the rest of the country
7286610 the goal is coming out of denver with a strong statement that democrats are unified i dont think anybody is taking anything for granted here
7286611 every single day we have to earn the confidence and trust of americans we have to be out there and connected in terms of what they need in solutions
7286612 we will need to come out united and energized and moving forward for barack obama
7286613 that we put on a show that connects with the american people and moves folks who havent really been paying attention
7286614 mark me down as one who says not being around a long time aint a bad thing there has to be change there has to be disruption
7286615 you know i admire disrupters our founders were disrupters martin luther king was a disrupter rosa parks was a disrupter barack obama will be an agent of change and the rest of us have to help with that disruption
7286616 suddenly i saw a white plastic bag flying across the track but could not avoid it and it went under the car i couldnt steer for two corners which was extremely dangerous fortunately most of the bag soon flew away but my confidence was very low over the next sector and i lost around three seconds in the end i finished third eventually i think my good qualifying result yesterday was crucial for todays result
7286617 this was one of the worst races ever for me to finish ninth in a car which is obviously good enough for third is a disaster after qualifying i was pretty confident because we realised we could go well but in the race i had big problems with the harder tyres during the first two stints and it was only better at the end with the softer compound i lost one position after the start and later in the race i couldnt gain any the pace wasnt there
7286618 first of all a big compliment to the organisers of the event for such a good first race
7286619 during the early laps he had some trouble as a plastic bag was stuck on his car and affected its handling apart from this both cars ran trouble free and the pit stops went well starting from eighth was not an ideal situation for nick we were hoping he would improve one or two places at the start but in the heat of the moment he unfortunately lost a position and then the race was basically over for him

7286622 stunning good looks the hire had to do with his wisdom camp obama says
7286623 look we didnt hire him for his stunning good looks obama campaign adviser robert gibbs said of the senator from delaware this morning on
7286624 we hired him for his judgment to lead this country if something happens to barack obama and the judgment and the advice that hell give the next president of the united states and we think weve got a fabulous pick
7286625 weve got somebody who hasnt forgotten where theyre from and somebody who can help rebuild this country
7286626 he picked somebody who has unparalleled expertise on foreign policy somebody who will help him rebuild the economy put people back to work make our country independent of energy
7286627 somebody that works in washington but doesnt live there and i think that says a lot about him doesnt forget where hes from i think it says a lot about who he picked he goes every night he goes home on an amtrak train where he knows the names of the conductors to his wife and family in delaware
7286628 i had a good start to the race and gained three places to 13th but that was the highlight of my race really
7286629 we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid after we had expected to perform a lot better
7286630 i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him
7286631 we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
7286632 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pitlane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday
7286633 we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race
7286634 i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
7286635 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pit lane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race we need to get to the bottom of the brake problems that we have had all weekend as these cost me a lot of time and positions it was a poor weekend overall
7286636 jenson got a good start and was able to make up three places during the first lap however the midfield was quite close today and with a heavy fuel load he was unable to progress through the field
7286637 contrary to expectation though there was relatively low attrition with only three cars failing to finish and no safety cars which meant there were no real opportunities to take advantage of
7286638 fundamentally we have improved the car over the august break and we saw clear signs of that progress in free practice
7286639 im definitely interested in wiiware and i think its one of the areas that 2d can still be very strong at im very much looking into that
7286640 i had a bad start and we have to find the reason for that on lap one going into turns four and five i was just behind alonso but there was a bit of a battle going on in front and i couldnt avoid him going into the corner after that i just tried to be consistent my pace was ok but i was behind barrichello and it was really difficult to overtake eventually i made it past him and my pace improved but it was too late
7286641 the first lap was rough as i was in the middle of the pack and lost several positions after that i tried to fight back but my front wing was damaged and it was difficult to overtake its a shame that we couldnt get into the top ten but i hope we can have a better race in spa for the belgian grand prix in a couple of weeks time
7286642 its a weekend to forget our objective remains to fight for fourth place in the championship and we must now stay focussed for the races to come and continue with our efforts to grow stronger
7286643 its good to be going home with a point today as its been a long time since it happened the race went quite well for me and i was giving it my all driving what felt like qualifying laps one after the other
7286644 the result is also good for the team as it shows we are getting back on track once again i would like to say that valencia has done a great job here and the race was good fun
7286645 i had a bad start and we have to find the reason for that
7286646 on lap one going into turns four and five i was just behind alonso but there was a bit of a battle going on in front and i couldnt avoid him going into the corner
7286647 this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7286648 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race
7286649 it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
7286650 i was hit from behind on the first lap i came back and passed a couple of cars but when i tried to pass one of the force indias i aborted the manoeuvre and made contact with them so sorry to them for that that damaged my barge board and the side of the car so after that the balance and downforce were very poor
7286651 a disastrous race david got involved in an incident in the first lap which damaged his car and mark who was on a one stop strategy was hoping for a safety car that never appeared he didnt have enough pace particularly after his pit stop its our most disappointing race of the year congratulations to sebastian vettel who drove very well today and demonstrated what the chassis is capable of
7286652 david got involved in an incident in the first lap which damaged his car and mark who was on a one stop strategy was hoping for a safety car that never appeared
7286653 he didnt have enough pace particularly after his pitstop its our most disappointing race of the year
7286654 that was a good result and a great performance by the team
7286655 the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout
7286656 this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit
7286657 the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7286658 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days
7286659 but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race
7286660 it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
7286661 this is the my kids school campus police im looking for my kid
7286662 you know what you dont get to say that you of all people dont get to say that
7286663 i know that she makes me happy i know that you you take away everything ashley
7286664 i have no one ashley no one you have spencer you have aiden im alone here i dont have my mother shes got a life without me i dont have friends i dont have anyone but i had her and now i dont i have no one
7286665 when i dont fuck up which i do on a regular basis
7286666 kid i fuck up all the time we still muddle through you and me were family you always have me
7286667 its hard youre off with spencer all the time youve got friends ive got nothing
7286668 its true and i loved her ashley i still love her you cant change that i dont care what you think i dont care
7286669 i know what she did and i dont condone it but she explained it and i understand it i dont think its okay it doesnt make it okay but i get it okay and i know she would never lay a finger on me i know it i just know it
7286670 you may want to re do your make up though you look like a cross between a raccoon and a badly done mime
7286671 for once in your blessed life kyla will you just trust me
7286672 when the hell are you people going to stop showing up unannounced
7286673 ok this is whats going to happen youre going to listen to me and then im going to leave
7286674 this is my sister my sister you understand you dont hurt her you dont harm a hair on her head or i will make sure your kidneys end up in countries you havent even heard of you take care of her you dont dump her you dont fuck around ok this is over when she says its over
7286675 now spencer and i are going to go spend the night at her house you guys just i really dont want to know actually
7286676 ill pay that because i care about her and youre her sister ill give you a free pass this one time let me make myself clear though if you lay a finger on me ever again youll be sorry
7286677 the first stint was ok as i was closing the gap to the rest of the field and then i could pass a few cars in the hairpin
7286678 it was a shame that i couldnt pass giancarlo quickly enough to take full advantage of the two stop strategy and lost a little time once i passed him it was getting better but it was still difficult to pass more cars then under braking i lost the rear and tried to avoid a crash but the barrier was too close and that was it
7286679 it was a difficult race with the very hot conditions but overall i think it was a good performance the strategy wasnt bad but we did expect a safety car after seeing the other support races but there werent any incidents so it didnt come our pace was good it wasnt far off the others and we made a step forward with the gearbox we now have to keep focussed and keep moving forward
7286680 although it was disappointing not to get two cars to the finish both drivers drove excellent races with good pace showing wed made a clear step forward adrian was honest enough to admit he made a mistake but until that point he was having a very good race we had put one car on one stop and the other on two to cover all bases in case of a safety car which we were expecting for this race and had he finished adrian on his two stops would have been able to finish just behind giancarlo overall its been a very positive weekend for the team
7286681 we worked so hard and the virginia maryland and d c potomac primaries were the beginning of his momentum that carried him through
7286682 it was just an amazing day for all of us
7286683 we feel a special sense of pride because we gave him the momentum he needed
7286684 every time i see obama he mentions something about how that was such a big day for him
7286685 he mentions the tremendous group of victories in maryland d c and virginia he will not forget us
7286686 i think the decisiveness of his victory was a big part in creating the conventional wisdom that we wouldnt be able to catch up with him
7286687 the clinton campaign probably thought feb 5 was going to be the knockout blow and then one week later to have such a clear group of states going obamas way really helped
7286688 we had done good door knocking and had strong visibility
7286689 to me it was kind of a fait accompli we had a business execution and i felt like if we executed wed win all 144 precincts
7286690 this is shaping up to be the poster child of poor planning in the state it is the worst project ive seen in 20 years
7286691 poorly treated sewage coming to the surface grounds in fields where kids could be playing
7286692 weve seen how poorly they do upkeep on other drip irrigation systems in the area
7286693 the responsibility of requirements for wastewater treatment systems used in calvert county rests with the maryland department of the environment
7286694 at this point the board has had absolutely no discussion about doing that
7286695 tell the court why you cant put your foot flat
7286696 my son was caught in the hubcap of your car
7286697 this is a public college you and i pay for it
7286698 i dont believe the term elitist was used but it certainly hung in the air
7286699 i think people confuse honors with elitism students do not fall through the cracks at st marys college that can hardly be considered elitist
7286700 in maryland right now we have a situation where we do not have enough capacity
7286701 if they are going to expand it should be in maryland not italy
7286702 we have to have our own programs there otherwise the only students who can do a study abroad are the ones with the means to do so
7286703 this idea that the public sector would move in and try to encourage alternative scheduling based on the idea of reducing traffic congestion reducing pollution most find it an appropriate time because of the price of gas
7286704 were in the midst of a very different sort of work world than we used to be were competing globally and it makes sense to have more flexibility more sense to have a framework where were going to be able to adjust in a hypercompetitive world
7286705 there are definitely some people who are still mourning but it gives us more of a sense of peace today im very proud to see the amount of people who have come out to show their support
7286706 in twenty some years of police work ive been to as many funerals where i knew the police officer who was killed and its stuff like this that puts the positive back into the life of the family
7286707 we raise some good funds help out the kids this is the way we serve the family thats what its all about
7286708 i dont know if a lot of people on the road realized what it was all about but i think they figured it out
7286709 there were a lot of flags a lot of waving

7286724 its probable according to statements made to us that groups of climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain as well as in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7286725 i am so glad so happy after such a bad result in hungary and the way it ended there
7286726 everyone did a fantastic job for me and it is a great result for the team
7286727 to take pole to win the race and to clock the fastest lap you cannot ask for more than that after such a bad experience in budapest
7286728 as far as i am concerned i did nothing wrong it is more about adrian sutil than me
7286729 we have great reliability and a great package and no worries about any of that
7286730 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck
7286731 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7286732 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7286733 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7286734 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me
7286735 we got this third because of our great qualifying performance on saturday
7286736 so the worlds gone and turned into hell right before my eyes

7286747 i was shocked i thought i was part of the future there but we had a long talk i understood what he was doing
7286748 the thought of not playing for middlesex and not playing at lords was one i couldnt really come to terms with
7286749 with the potential in the current squad i am sure that we can seriously challenge for honours in the next few years
7286750 it is great news that a player as highly regarded as owais has committed his future to middlesex
7286751 i am sure we can build on the success achieved this year with players of his quality in our side

7286767 tandbergs strategic value as the leading player in a rapidly growing niche positions the company as an attractive acquisition target
7286768 we would not rule out industrial players entering the scene
7286769 many of the financial shareholders who have been shareholders for some time view tandberg as undervalued and expect a realistic bid to be a great deal above the current share price

7286773 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread
7286774 you might get artificial intelligence or robotics but those are still so undeveloped at least in widespread impact
7286775 it really is a milestone i think and shows the world this opportunity to all work together and how places like hong kong and china will be such an important part of the future
7286776 whether its software or energy or agriculture the promise of science is much greater than ever before and thats why im so optimistic

7286788 i think its very interesting that were looking at new information regarding oil exploration and extraction
7286789 were not trying to solve the national problem or the problem of energy but this is to examine the natural resource of oil as it effects the county
7286790 it looks like theyre looking for revenue streams in royalties and fees but they need to weigh the cost versus the benefit
7286791 the difference with the tranquillon ridge project is that there would be minimal impacts to the environment whereas brand new facilities are a completely different story
7286792 this is the point in time where we should really explore options for other energy sources and look to the future

7286806 it took me five years to locate a cable that connects the siren to the speakers i love this car because it has so much history and i had to get special permission from the chp to restore it
7286807 i got pulled over by a chp officer the first time i drove it because in california its illegal to have a black car with a white roof and doors i was coached by an officer how to drive it because it impedes traffic
7286808 this is our first year in the show and its funny because we drove this car to solvang on our honeymoon almost 40 years ago
7286809 this is a fantastic place and just a great setting for a car show all the cars are beautiful and you can tell people really put in time and effort into their vehicles

7286814 up to 100 us banks could go bust over the coming year conventional wisdom has it that americas well developed system of deposit insurance will shield savers from any losses but the federal deposit insurance corporation has assets of only 50bn while the combined assets of the banks in danger total around 900bn
7286815 if you look past all the guns slung over peoples shoulders the big armored personnel carriers humvees and blackhawk helicopters you can almost forget theres a war going on
7286816 on the big bases in iraq theres a certain normalcy that makes you forget there are still people fighting and dying here but you get reminded real quick
7286817 every risk id take would make me think about that i wasnt taking a lot of the big risks that a lot of journalists do going out looking for a firefight or an adrenaline rush but there were risks
7286818 youd never walk across the street without a flak jacket
7286819 it would be presumptuous to go over there and say this is the situation in iraq what youre really looking at are all these people
7286820 i think its a shame that we dont do more stories about military personnel because theyre doing this in our name theres definitely some ugly stuff going on but there are a lot of positive things too the downside about embedding is that its difficult to make contact with iraqis who arent connected to the americans
7286821 they would go into these palm groves and do sweeps and ambushes
7286822 in diyala insurgents were doing ethnic cleansing we saw deserted towns and part of the american militarys humanitarian mission was to relocate refugees back to their villages iraq is like beirut at its worst time mixed in with some west bank chicago during the 1920s and maybe a little south central too
7286823 sometimes you cant tell if its the war or poverty thats done this to a town and sometimes its a double whammy of both
7286824 read your bible its an extension of the holy land and is significant to a lot of religious groups you wonder if it should even be one country but the flip side is that were now responsible for all of that shit i have a five year old and a seven year old and theyre going to be dealing with this
7286825 the families of these units are all desperate for information
7286826 a lot of these reserve and national guard units never get covered in the media and their families just eat it up when they are

7286834 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7286835 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7286836 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7286837 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7286838 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7286843 large corporate companies rely on anti virus products to protect their infrastructure but the problem with this approach is that these products only detect around 60 per cent of threats out there
7286844 in the right hands viruses can easily bypass these programs as was the case here
7286845 i hope that they finally got someone the guy that really did it
7286846 how clear your water is in beaver lake is a good indication of the health of the lake
7286847 the water clarity is probably half right now what it was last year
7286848 the silt line has never been to the dam until this year for the first time in 45 years weve had so much rain and so much silt it actually carried it from the river arms all the way up to the dam
7286849 the cleaner it is the less it costs for the beaver water district to take the lake water and turn it into drinking water for the public
7286850 i found a russia on the move a russia that is trying to intimidate its neighbors who are democratic in nature

7286875 it helps to answer a perplexing question how can there be gay genes given that gay sex doesnt lead to procreation
7286876 the answer is remarkably simple the same gene that causes men to like men also causes women to like men and as a result to have more children
7286877 the positive effect of an x linked gene on female fecundity tends to outweigh the negative effect of the gene on male fecundity
7286878 we understand that the genetic component has to interact with something to produce different phenotypes

7286894 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7286895 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7286896 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7286897 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7286898 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe

7286913 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them

7286926 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it

7287009 i think that at the end of the year we will be above 10 percent we are waging a war on results but its not short term
7287010 in 2007 i think revenue growth should be around 2 percent between 1 percent and 3 percent in terms of profitability we could reach 12 percent at some point this year
7287011 i always view pricing as very aggressive and i think to make money in this marketplace its difficult
7287012 i clean them so no dust and fluff gets stuck in them
7287013 its been a kind of beyond your wildest dreams experience to be mentioned
7287014 it was very very flattering to be considered to be mentioned by folks for that position was very gratifying
7287015 when i signed on with senator obama it wasnt to get anything
7287016 my complete expectation is im going to be governor until january 2010
7287017 senator obama has made a great pick in joe biden
7287018 senator obama and senator biden will work very very well in virginia
7287019 i can tell you i suspect theres a great sigh of relief
7287020 there are a bunch of folks who have said i would really hate to lose tim as governor
7287021 democratic caucus and a likely candidate for governor next year said he was proud of kaine as well as sen mark r warner d who were also thought to be under consideration for showing the country that democrats are succeeding in virginia
7287022 of all the things ive ever lost i miss my mind the most

7287029 im seeing a group of young people kind of coming up and expressing their views in political rallies and most of them are talking like they are getting inspiration from a young leader like mr barack obama
7287030 i have a lot of old t shirts it would take me hours to sort through all of them

7287034 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7287035 yielded to the very swift boat politics he once deplored
7287036 hell have to worry which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7287037 the nice thing about hosting one of these conventions is that you can show off
7287038 we dont want some traffic jam protest or unfortunate incident to become the big story because theres too much good stuff going on here we have the infrastructure to be prepared to handle anything
7287039 weve always had to overcome this idea that were not big enough or important enough to even be part of the national political landscape
7287040 that was part of the idea behind wanting to get the convention in the first place if people see colorado and the western spirit theyll get past all of that
7287041 was concerned with the impact that hunters lobbying activities might have on his expected campaign for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination
7287042 biden told lotito that in light of these concerns his brother had asked him to seek lotitos assistance in finding employment for hunter in a non lobbying capacity
7287043 this lawsuit has nothing to do with joe biden and there is absolutely no truth to those allegations
7287044 it is a business dispute between former partners the suit is baseless
7287045 there was a concern that hunter bidens role as a lobbyist would have an impact on the senators proposed presidential run
7287046 thats what james biden told mr lotito was it true who knows there is no allegation the senator was involved in any of these events
7287047 i guess we are not surprised but we wouldnt have been surprised the other way
7287048 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7287049 obama will see a significant bump and believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
7287050 obviously the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7287051 the parties intention is to go ahead and resolve the case
7287052 there was a complete breakdown in what really is one of the most important decision making processes at the department of justice

7287057 cia has made its own inquiries overseas and no one no individual and no intelligence service has substantiated suskinds account of habbush or the bogus letter
7287058 at this point the origins of the forgery like the whereabouts of habbush himself remain unclear but this much is certain suskind is off the mark
7287059 theres not a shred of doubt about any of it
7287060 to state what should be obvious it is not the policy or practice of this agency to violate american law
7287061 it is ridiculous to think that the white house would give me such an order and even more ridiculous to think that i would carry it out

7287072 how fortunate for governments that the people they administer dont think
7287073 do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail
7287074 i think for too long we have been silent and our people have taken that silence as part of an acquiescence of the status quo
7287075 we are complicit in this so we have to step forward and say no this is not right it is wrong it is sinful
7287076 they somehow have bought the package you can be personally opposed
7287077 we must avoid giving people the impression that one can be in a state of mortal sin and receive the eucharist
7287078 secondly there could be another form of scandal consisting of leading people to think that the public act that this person is doing which until now everyone believed was a serious sin is really not that serious if the church allows him or her to receive communion
7287079 if we have a public figure who is openly and deliberately upholding abortion rights and receiving the eucharist what will the average person think he or she could come to believe that it up to a certain point it is okay to do away with an innocent life in the mothers womb

7287084 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime

7287089 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7287090 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7287091 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7287092 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7287093 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7287094 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7287095 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7287096 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7287097 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7287098 video that lists the necessary ingredients and shows some self described rednecks blowing up small plastic bottles in their yard

7287160 and so we believe the games had a good influence

7287203 if were going to play with the big boys if were going to be a g8 nation lets be g8 at all levels
7287204 its definitely hard to compete with the top countries especially when you look at diving trampoline and gymnastics
7287205 it was so difficult to compete against the chinese athletes here and the programs they have in place are just amazing
7287206 funding has to come early enough that theres time for the athletes to prepare and have access to everything they need and the support they need to compete with the top countries in the world were already seeing small improvements and hopefully its going to continue that way
7287207 we made a decision some time ago to start targeting the money and we realized we couldnt be a mile wide and an inch deep
7287208 australia targets the sports where they know they can get medals
7287209 im not sure we can ever be as targeted as that and i dont think canadians would accept that we have a certain egalitarian nature that is going to demand that every kid gets a chance but we can target more than we have in the past
7287210 the more you see of these tremendous young people the more you want to see of them but if you dont see them and you dont know who they are there isnt that passion to watch them
7287211 its tough enough in the ups and downs of the olympics world its another game in the ups and downs of the political world
7287212 athletes are training to perform in the sports world we would be very careful how they might be used in the political field
7287213 i had to take a step out and collect my thoughts and collect my emotions and come back out its a very meaningful moment
7287214 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7287215 im sure he was overwhelmed by everything not only what happened on the volleyball court
7287216 its just something he poured his heart and soul into for the last four years
7287217 but certainly with the tragedy that befell his family at the beginning of these games im so happy he was able to be here and experience this with us
7287218 because hes a huge if not the biggest part of our team
7287219 its hard to analyze the match right now the u s played very well theyve grown a lot in the last few years
7287220 we did our best but the best was not enough
7287221 it hasnt been easy not that it was ever going to be easy but when you throw in the emotional load that the team has had to bear collectively for them to come through and be this good is a wonderful achievement
7287222 she said it first she said you won you won you won nothing else to say there just listening to each other smile on the phone
7287223 we need to get home and get on with that now
7287224 the avalanche occurred at dawn on the french side hitting a group of climbers who were roped together
7287225 the senator has even brought his military record into discussion of his music tastes explaining that his favorite song was dancing queen by abba he offered that his knowledge of music stopped evolving when his plane intercepted a surface to air missile dancing queen however was produced in 1975 eight years after mccains plane was shot down
7287226 they were always sharp and motivated and defended very well and we didnt create enough chances to win the game
7287227 in the first half in midfield we were dominated and not strong or quick enough and we suffered
7287228 we tried very hard into the last second of the game but we could not score
7287229 gerrard showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7287230 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7287231 we have just got to get to the point where we have got an agreement and thats got to be right for both parties
7287232 i know he wants to stay i know he likes it here really likes it here
7287233 we take a piece out of the tail and then we take a core sample from the middle
7287234 its called swimming the fish and it gradually brings them back to life and gets rid of the acid buil dup in the fish
7287235 this is going to bloom and take over other departments
7287236 our community just raised 24 5 million for this new hospital and now they want to start putting money into the pockets of private companies
7287237 what were really trying to do is test the waters and see whats available out there and make informed choices
7287238 then there are fewer peo ple doing the same amount of work and the quality falls

7287268 its just like sometimes you see some of the biggest rallies in stocks during the start of a bear market or even during a bear market
7287269 it seems like the slowdown in industrial world growth has finally cut the legs out from under the commodity rally for now
7287270 and now its really on chinas shoulders and the rest of the developing world to see whether they can hang in there
7287271 our own view is that china will do surprisingly well over the next year but whether thats enough to get oil prices rising is doubtful
7287272 the consensus is we will get some very modest growth in the second quarter were looking at all of a 0 6 per cent annualized rise in gdp which just barely offsets the decline we saw in the first quarter
7287273 it should be just enough to keep the economy out of a technical recession i think the economy will be fortunate to turn out much growth in the second half of the year either
7287274 of course now the focus turns to the earning season and i think in most cases people are looking for a bit of a deterioration in underlying earnings
7287275 and i think thats where the focus could turn for earnings
7287276 i think the focus could increasingly be on how core earnings are doing and whether there are any signs that the underlying weakness or slowdown in the north american economy is hitting the core earnings

7287286 we dont want the facility open for one year with no one allowed to go into it

7287292 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7287293 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7287294 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes

7287309 hell be the first to tell you that winning wont bring todd back
7287310 however this is a goal that he and his family have invested their lives in just like we have and so i know this is an incredibly special moment for us
7287311 it dawned on me that wed just won the thing and i grabbed my staff theyve been so instrumental in our success obviously for the first three matches of this tournament they were without me and they did a wonderful job then after i shook the coaches hands it was just a little too much
7287312 our youth program has really increased and its really helping its a very good buildup toward these kinds of games and the championships
7287313 we had expected that we would have performed much much better than we have done but on the whole we are not totally disappointed
7287314 we only brought a team of 13 athletes for swimming track and field cycling rowing and tennis
7287315 so when we look in terms of people that we have brought we feel as a nation we put up a fairly commendable performance
7287316 its one of the best organized olympic games that i have attended in terms of accommodation in terms of transportation and in terms of hospitality in general i think they have done a good job facilities were first class
7287317 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever

7287320 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7287321 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7287322 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7287323 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7287335 even before i left for the bigg bosss house i had told my people that i will give them a message as to how long i would like to stay on the second day itself i told the inmates that if they had to choose someone they should choose me and my fans got the message i had taken up the show as a challenge so that i could learn about the entertainment world in this process i also showed them the more humane face of a politician after all we guys are not from mars and one week was enough according to me for this mutual education

7287337 i was reading his palm because i dabble in palmistry and i merely told him that his fate line shows that he will always be known as his fathers son aur bade baap ki aulad hona koi buri baat hai kya in fact i and his dad pramod mahajan had some serious differences par maine uss bachche ko kabhi yeh ehsaas nahin hone diya
7287338 yes i stand by that statement payal and rahul are having an affair they have been together for six years and they came together on this show i even asked payal to name her boyfriend but she skirted the issue since shes such a chui mui and emotional kind of girl i left her alone otherwise i would have asked her tumhara boyfriend hum main se koi ek toh nahin hai
7287339 sambhavna and rahul will not be liked by people sambhavnas behaviour is atrocious and rahul is trying to hog maximum footage by always sitting in front of the camera woh apni image sudharne ke liye show par aaya hai agar woh bathroom saaf karega toh adhe ghante pehle chilla chilla kar sabko batayega aur kaam karne ke baad der tak sabko apne kaam ki jankari dega people will resent these manipulations

7287367 this will underpin the rio share price and also create uncertainty about whether or not bhp will get its deal over the line
7287368 even if chinalco doesnt increase its stake it shows they have the capacity to block the deal
7287369 while australia welcomes foreign investment in our economy we will carefully examine national interest issues where these arise in relation to foreign sovereign ownership
7287370 chinalco will have to reapply to increase its stake beyond the level approved and has agreed not to seek representation on rios board mr swan said
7287371 it could do a soft deal with bhp and vote for the merger in return for securing the assets

7287383 this team a year ago no one would consider being olympic champions
7287384 its just such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls
7287385 theres no disappointment if we would have come out today and not fought id maybe have a different answer to that
7287386 i cant explain to you where our team was several months ago and where we are now from inside out how weve grown how weve played for each other
7287387 as the tournament went on the more i believed in us and where we could go and what we could do thats a tribute to all the girls
7287388 we wouldnt be here right now if not for logan
7287389 clearly its a worry that weve got specific job losses occurring in certain companies but that of course is part and parcel of overall economic activity
7287390 i think its very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things what you have to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is in reasonably good shape
7287391 we did an examination of those suppliers and 46 of the 200 have a turnover under 50 million
7287392 we are at a point where we have to act and act quickly on tariffs

7287394 you always get the odd parent who goes a bit silly
7287395 but telling them to calm down or leave the ground usually works
7287396 its hard when you are running sporting clubs and its also hard for volunteers to actually be enforcing bans
7287397 but for parents not to attend the game for a while would be good
7287398 if it keeps children playing then thats what we want to achieve
7287399 our club has a rule that if you chance it then you will be asked to leave
7287400 in the absolute worst circumstances violence should be reported to the police
7287401 if they cross the line the codes of conduct need to be enforced whether that means banning parents from a game or banning them for a year its up to the clubs and leagues
7287402 in a minority of cases we do see occasions where spectators cross the line from being passionate about their kids on the field to extreme behaviour whether verbal abuse or physical abuse
7287403 this is about people pulling their heads in we want to encourage those clubs and leagues to actually enforce those codes and help tackle this problem head on
7287404 didnt thoroughly prepare or research the australian market and now theyre paying the price
7287405 and believe me if youve worked with tattersalls you know what professional is
7287406 australians dont like complicated lottery games theyre used to buying tickets for games offered by tatts like quick picks and powerball that are all over in five seconds
7287407 theyre not into drawing lucky lines or complex bingo games where you have snowballs in the middle and all the rest of it
7287408 intralot just didnt do the work to find out the australian mentality
7287409 sales are trending upwards as retailers and consumers become more familiar with the games and intralot is confident that it will achieve its forecasts
7287410 not everthing is fixed but overall its far better than it was
7287411 i think wed all have to acknowledge that when you have something new in a business venture its going take some time
7287412 tatts used to make more than 1 billion a year in lottery sales and the government took home 36 cents in every dollar

7287426 the nomination of sen barack obama as the democratic partys candidate for president of the united states is a historic event in the lives of african americans so it is important for tv one to be there for our audience
7287427 while viewers can get coverage of the convention from any number of networks we plan to cover the convention from a uniquely african american perspective
7287428 in addition to platform disagreements and what senator obamas running mate is likely to say in his or her acceptance speech well talk about the parties the fashion the food and the people as well as the funny and off beat moments that happen on the convention floor

7287433 obama recognized the gap on national security and he recognized the need to get tougher on mccain and he chose the guy who can most quickly help him on both counts
7287434 we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this
7287435 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7287436 his brain is an asset but his mouth is a major liability when the latter starts trumping the former and it inevitably will the democrats will have a problem on their hands
7287437 there should be no doubt that this is going to be a rough campaign from here on out and biden knows how to fight im sure that was a strong consideration
7287438 this is an admission by barack obama that he doesnt have the experience to be president more than a vice president hes looking for a hand holder or a tutor
7287439 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7287440 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
7287441 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7287442 the individual is handicapped by coming face to face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists
7287443 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7287444 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7287445 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7287446 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7287447 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7287448 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7287449 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7287450 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7287451 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7287452 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7287453 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7287454 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7287455 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7287456 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7287457 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7287458 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7287459 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7287460 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7287461 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7287462 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7287463 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7287464 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7287465 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7287466 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7287467 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7287468 they have arrived at such a difficult time it means we are not alone
7287469 kevin08 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08
7287470 i decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership and particularly about that costellos future
7287471 everyone else is commenting on it so ill just leave it to others
7287472 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan
7287473 i would expect it would be around that time that he would make it clear what his future intentions are
7287474 from my perspective peter costello has earned the right to make the decision in his good time with his family and his electors and announce it when it suits him and i expect that will be very soon
7287475 weve had all year a treasurer who is the only treasurer in the whole world that has been talking down his own economy and talking up inflation
7287476 the storys a bit of a snooze but the vid is worth clicking on for the tutorial it offers in slow pitch interviewing techniques

7287492 our father who is in heaven gives good things to those who ask him
7287493 you need to understand what jesus was saying in the context the first century civilization in which he was speaking
7287494 when jesus talked about moving a mountain he was speaking metaphorically when someone says it is raining cats and dogs no one takes him literally jesus was using a figure of speech rather than speaking literally

7287515 an undeniable inculpatory admission of the harvesting of falun gong practitioner prisoners for profit
7287516 so here we have on our recording an admission from a doctor that he and his colleagues used to go to a prison to select falun gong practitioners for their organs he does not just say that someone else did this he says that he and his colleagues used to do this themselves moreover we have a further admission that the voice we have on our recording is the voice of the very person our recording says he is
7287517 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7287518 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7287519 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7287520 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7287521 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7287522 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7287523 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7287524 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7287525 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7287526 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7287527 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7287528 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7287529 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7287530 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7287531 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7287532 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7287533 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7287534 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7287535 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7287536 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7287537 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7287538 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7287539 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7287540 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7287541 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7287542 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7287543 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7287544 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7287545 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7287546 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

7287549 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7287551 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7287552 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7287553 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7287554 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7287555 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7287556 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7287557 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7287558 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7287559 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7287560 who are open to doing something on the production side
7287561 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7287562 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7287563 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7287564 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7287565 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7287566 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7287567 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7287568 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7287569 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7287570 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7287571 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7287572 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7287573 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7287574 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7287588 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen in the best western raid makes this particularly rare the russian gangs who specialise in this kind of work will have been exploiting the information from the moment it became available late on thursday night in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7287589 large corporate companies rely on anti virus products to protect their infrastructure but the problem with this approach is that these products only detect around 60 of threats out there in the right hands viruses can easily bypass these programs as was the case here

7287592 its just like sometimes you see some of the biggest rallies in stocks during the start of a bear market or even during a bear market
7287593 it seems like the slowdown in industrial world growth has finally cut the legs out from under the commodity rally for now
7287594 and now its really on chinas shoulders and the rest of the developing world to see whether they can hang in there
7287595 our own view is that china will do surprisingly well over the next year but whether thats enough to get oil prices rising is doubtful
7287596 the consensus is we will get some very modest growth in the second quarter were looking at all of a 0 6 per cent annualized rise in gdp which just barely offsets the decline we saw in the first quarter
7287597 it should be just enough to keep the economy out of a technical recession i think the economy will be fortunate to turn out much growth in the second half of the year either
7287598 of course now the focus turns to the earning season and i think in most cases people are looking for a bit of a deterioration in underlying earnings
7287599 and i think thats where the focus could turn for earnings

7287618 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7287619 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games

7287626 the merardo arce command new peoples army has granted a conditional amnesty to retired master sergeant jose manero and ordered his immediate release from custodial detention by the 1st pulang bagani company npa

7287628 writers block is going to happen to you you will read what little youve written lately and see with absolute clarity that it is total dog shit or else you havent been able to write anything at all for a while the fear that youll never write again is going to hit you when you feel not only lost and unable to find a few little bread crumbs that would identify the path you were on but also when youre at your lowest ebb of energy and faith
7287629 the problem is acceptance which is something were taught not to do were taught to improve uncomfortable situations to change things to alleviate unpleasant feelings but if you accept the reality that you have been given that you are not in a productive creative period you free yourself to begin filling up again i encourage my students at times like these to get one page of anything written three hundred words of memories or dreams of stream of consciousness on how much they hate writing just for the hell of it just to keep their fingers from becoming too arthritic just because they have made a commitment to try to write three hundred words every day then on bad days and weeks let things go at that

7287676 a scene in which the us army spokesman general tommy franks addressed journalists cost 200 000 and was produced by a designer who had worked for disney metro goldwyn mayer and the television programme good morning america in 2001 the white house had put him in charge of creating background designs for presidential speeches unsurprising to those aware of the ties between the pentagon and hollywood more surprising was the pentagon decision to recruit david blaine for interior design he is a magician famous in the us for his tv show and for conjuring tricks such as levitating or being shut in a cage without food
7287677 the stage was designed to facilitate the candid and personal tone that americans have come to expect from senator mccain the intimate setting will be a fitting backdrop for senator mccains acceptance speech
7287678 they dnc will bring so many lights and speakers as many as 300 000 pounds worth the ceiling will have to be reinforced to hold them
7287679 the aide said that guys like me were in what we call the reality based community which he defined as people who believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality
7287680 mission accomplished major combat operations in iraq have ended in the battle of iraq the united states and our allies have prevailed
7287681 great struggle that tests our strength and even more our resolve
7287682 when policy dooms you start telling stories stories so fabulous so gripping so spellbinding that the king or in this case the american citizen who theoretically rules our country forgets all about a lethal policy it plays on the insecurity of americans who feel that their lives are out of control
7287683 betting that the voters will be mesmerised by john wayne style tales of real men fighting evil on the frontier at least enough americans to avoid the death sentence that the voters might otherwise pronounce on the party that brought us the disaster in iraq
7287684 the scheherazade strategy is a great scam built on the illusion that moralistic tales can make us feel secure no matter whats actually going on out there in the world rove wants every vote for a republican to be a symbolic statement
7287685 ill never forget my first visit she welcomed me into her home in the way she knew best by offering good food the moment i tasted her divine chicken curry i was in awe
7287686 like any brit i knew and loved indian food but the food i tasted on that day was something beyond what i had come to expect
7287687 the flavours were cleaner brighter and yet despite its depth and savour the food was somehow lighter than i had experienced before

7287690 although it is not lethal it can lead to death indirectly of unborn children it can lead to highly traumatising effects on children particularly and adults too repeated attacks of that kind have resulted in widespread bedwetting and behavioural changes depression and anxiety symptoms in both children and adults i have seen children who have changed completely after being subjected to sonic booms from sociable to clingy and anxious crying all the time some of them do not eat or sleep as they used to older children have difficulty concentrating while others became violent

7287695 i agree with them but under no circumstances can indian citizens be allowed to promote secession
7287696 advocating the right of kashmiris to secede as a professional female agitator
7287697 personally i feel that even publicising such treasonable views leave alone using dedicated columns to indulge in secessionist propaganda should invite the charge of promoting terrorism and anti national activity

7287702 i liked the story because it is so dramatic and it reflects human complexity

7287704 in independent movies you do whatever you which nobody imposes the topic or the cast on you
7287705 i did not think my film was that provocative especially that the sexual scenes were not imposed on the plot

7287749 opera thinks it is acceptable under specific circumstances to release a security update without publishing an advisory for the specific bug
7287750 if we publish without an advisory it is often because other vendors have not issued patches
7287751 publishing a full advisory only because weve patched something could leave users of other products unprotected while giving malicious hackers the information needed to cause damage

7287755 its the closest thing to hell ive seen the corpses were boiling everything was burning there was nothing left that resembled a plane it was in pieces its a miracle anyone survived
7287756 i saw it take off and it climbed to about 200 metres when flames appeared in the engine it then crashed to the ground and disappeared from view in a hollow past the end of the runway
7287757 the plane left the gate for take off at 1 20 pm but then the pilot apologised and said he would have to return because of a technical problem
7287758 an hour later we went to take off i heard a horrible noise and the next thing i remember was being flung from the aircraft i must have passed out but woke when there was a loud explosion
7287759 i could hardly move but lifted my head and saw other bodies around me there was incredible heat and i heard people and children crying for help i lifted my head and all i saw were scattered bodies
7287760 such engine fires are extremely rare but when they do occur they are invariably the result of some form of mechanical failure
7287761 the obvious suspicion is some kind of engine problem the suspicion is that for whatever reason the aircraft had insufficient power to pull away
7287762 the organised chaos in which the company exists cant continue
7287763 the lack of resources and their quality on the ground the repeated aogs grounded planes in the fleet the scarcity of crews and the system of movement of crew members mean that the general feeling is one of operational chaos that places the passengers at risk

7287775 more modular model where well give dealers the opportunity to sell additional features as required these features will not be available on the x100 the base level box
7287776 all because were trying to further provide dealers with products that they can make money on rather than race to zero against best buy
7287777 the biggest weak point is the lack of purchasable hi def content
7287778 if you sell a box that holds a lot of 1080p movies people want to collect them they dont want to collect them in 480p

7287788 this was data that was being held in a secure form but was downloaded on to a memory stick by an external contractor
7287789 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
7287790 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20 billion id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco at a cost of millions of pounds to the uk taxpayer
7287791 this will destroy any grain of confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
7287792 im just gobsmacked like everyone else is that the government can be so systematically incompetent in failing to keep our data safe
7287793 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
7287794 with every new government data bungle another ounce of public trust ebbs away

7287832 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket
7287833 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7287834 sen obamas choice in a running mate once again brings up his questionable judgment when faced with making major decisions
7287835 sen biden has long been a leading critic of sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience hes criticized sen obama for his lack of leadership and judgment on iraq afghanistan and his commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of rogue states
7287836 clearly showcases that obama is aware that he lacks the experience if you will and the judgment in foreign policy arenas
7287837 twenty years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7287838 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7287839 youre getting national security experience youre getting enthusiasm and you hope youre getting some help in those white working class blue collar towns where barack obama needs help
7287840 the rap on him is that he talks too long his speeches dont end and occasionally he goes off the reservation
7287841 has a personal story as well triumph over tragedy he brings depth to this ticket
7287842 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook
7287843 an editorial in the los angeles times said in addition to his uncontrolled verbosity biden is a gaffe machine can you reassure voters in this country that you would have the discipline you would need on the world stage senator
7287844 biden can help a lot by first reassuring and even more important putting bush and mccain on trial and showing that barack obama is change thats what i think well see joe biden doing over the next couple of months
7287845 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7287846 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7287847 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7287848 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7287849 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it

7287857 the enemies of gods predestination are stupid and ignorant and the devil hath plucked out their eyes
7287858 such men fight against the holy ghost like mad beasts and endeavor to abolish the holy scripture there is more honesty in the papists than in these men for the doctrine of the papists is a great deal better more holy and more agreeable to the sacred scriptures than the doctrine of those vile and wicked men who cast down gods holy election these dogs that bark at it and swine that root it up
7287859 the devil hath no fitter instruments than those who fight against predestination
7287860 de spin heeft twee dagen in een glazen pot op de toonbank van de afdeling gestaan
7287861 it just was shocking and we didnt know what to do except just love on the girls as much as we could
7287862 the older daughter was already on the phone with 911 and she told me ms julie my daddy just shot my mommy and shot himself
7287863 weve been neighbors for over five years and our girls played with their girls many a days so its been tough
7287864 kids love her they always have she even taught my daughter
7287865 she wanted to make sure all of her kids learned so she would make games she would decorate her room the environment in her room was just wonderful
7287866 its going to be devastating monday this is the second year that weve lost a teacher at the beginning of the year
7287867 a perfect day it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track my start was not so good on the dirty side and going into turn 1 i was right on the limit and very close to kimi and could defend my position against jarno for the first stint but he had a bit more fuel on board and stayed out an extra lap and he overtook me in the pits but we can be very very happy with this result we made no mistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance the whole team can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races we can be in the top ten again
7287868 that was a very nice race apart from the fact that i touched with heidfeld which broke my wing which was a real shame as i had to do 17 laps like that losing around 20 seconds to the group i was in the next two stints were good quality and i had a good pace but i am happy with the result and i think we had the right strategy its my best result since australia and especially from the second stint onwards i felt much more comfortable and confident with the car and felt i could push as the track rubbered in as for the next races i continue to tackle them one at a time and hope that next time out in spa i can make it into the points
7287869 all weekend the team has performed excellently we ended up with both our drivers finishing where they started in sixth and tenth places which is a solid result as all the top teams apart from ferrari had both their cars finish vettel had a good start considering he was on the dirty side of the track but a touch with raikkonen left him with some vibration from the front left wheel and his second stint he had a bit of graining bourdais also drove a good race and also performed well through the weekend we have shown that our performance is improving from race to race and so we are looking forward to spa and monza i am convinced that both of these races especially monza will suit our package for scuderia toro rosso and our red bull parent company this has been a really successful weekend
7287870 its good to be going home with a point today as its been a long time since it happened the race went quite well for me and i was giving it my all driving what felt like qualifying laps one after the other the result is also good for the team as it shows we are getting back on track once again i would like to say that valencia has done a great job here and the race was good fun
7287871 i had a bad start and we have to find the reason for that on lap one going into turns four and five i was just behind alonso but there was a bit of a battle going on in front and i couldnt avoid him going into the corner after that i just tried to be consistent my pace was ok but i was behind barrichello and it was really difficult to overtake eventually i made it past him and my pace improved but it was too late
7287872 with the reliability of the cars these days one point is what you can expect from starting 9th and 11th on the grid kazuki went into anti stall at the start which lost him a lot of places he then had to pit for a new front wing which put paid to what would have been a one stop race nico squeezed everything he could out of the car today unfortunately we missed out on seventh place with him by a few fractions of a second in his second pit stop we now have to return to the factory to find those few tenths
7287873 interminable discussion of building use 10 15 20 mins into building usage ugh poster child for nightmare meeting people upset about the form give me a gun gak
7287874 allemaal de schuld van het kastje ik houd bnn verantwoordelijk voor mijn lage score
7287875 toen er een auto met pech langs de kant van de weg stond
7287876 oftewel twee linkervoeten uit de scene waar pippi hinkelt met rode verf onder haar voeten
7287877 neeeeeeee anne fleur niet met je vieze smeerkaasvingers aan mijn shirt zitten
7287878 nee hoor ik vind het ook weer leuk als je me op komt halen want ik vind het fijn thuis

7287884 jingle bell jingle bell toet toeet h ga s effe aan de kant met dat gammele paard van je
7287885 zeg patser met je grote vrachtauto wie denk je wel dat je bent
7287886 de kerstman piet kom s even kijken waar die kerstbal mee aan komt scheuren en maar klagen dat er geen geld meer is
7287887 nou ik word er een beetje goed ziek van ik ben nog niet eens jarig geweest
7287888 ja hallo de paashaas is pas aan de beurt als pasen en pinksteren op n dag vallen
7287889 i think it wasnt very clever from his side because even if he got out in front of me he would need to let me by so it was a little bit of a shame to fight with him in the pit lane
7287890 i stopped behind him on the pit stop and we left together so when he was passing me by i was leaving the garage so we were side by side
7287891 but i mean i was the leader and he was a lapped car
7287892 i came very close to colliding with him so i needed to back off and for sure i lost a lot of time
7287893 it was quite narrow the wall was getting closer and closer so i didnt want to take any risks
7287894 i was driving down the pit lane and suddenly a car came there
7287895 i went to the left a little bit and then after the first corner i tried to let him past as soon as possible
7287896 in the pits everybody is in a rush to do everything as fast as possible
7287897 weve seen it many times in races that sometimes cars go out side by side
7287898 for sure the guy on the pit stop should look before releasing the car but i want to see it on tv and then i can give a better statement
7287899 it was nothing to do with him we have to consider what happened
7287900 but id rather not talk about that now to be honest id rather talk about the fact that the kids done a fantastic race
7287901 we are the ones that we have been waiting for
7287902 just remember when you consider fighting fire with fire remember that the fire department uses water
7287903 what youre saying is hurtful i would like you to stop now
7287904 making fun of me and others hurts their feelings if you cannot keep from making fun of me then dont bother speaking to me at all
7287905 steadfast in allegiance unwavering in devotion faithful to ones oath commitments or obligations showing faithfulness to commitments vows allegiance obligations or to ones country loyalty is also the act of binding yourself intellectually and emotionally to a course of action
7287906 treachery disloyalty unfaithful in guarding maintaining or fulfilling disappointing the hopes and expectations of revealing or violating a confidence to deceive misguide or corrupt to lead astray deceive
7287907 i made one great mistake in my life when i signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made
7287908 when you seek to profit by deluding others you only delude yourself
7287909 last year was a big learning experience for me because i have been a player for 26 years of my life i never really had any interest to become a coach you respect people like coach white who has coached here for 28 years and their role as far as molding young men to be good citizens because 99 9 percent of these kids wont make it to the level i made it to these are the challenges that coach white and the coaching staff here the influence that they have on these guys going on through their life and going on to becoming good men and good husbands those are the things that i have learned as far as the football it is very basic
7287910 number one he is just a great guy but with his experience his credibility the kids listen when he says something he is an imposing force just looking at him but more important he is just a great guy and he is very humble he doesnt brag about himself ever it is just great having him out here this is his second year out here coaching and we will have him for at least one more year because his son is a junior i know jesse is legend in hawaii and he is a legend in san francisco he is just a class guy
7287911 the things that i learned when i was blocking for joe montana and steve young were all the tricks of the trade so it is not good for these guys to learn all that stuff yet
7287912 very tough very tough because everybody knows whose son he is and the unrealistic expectations so to speak and it is not fair to my son but i want him to develop his own game the number one thing i want him to do is enjoy the game
7287913 just because i am their dad and i am an all pro and a super bowl champion doesnt mean my kids still look at me as their dad they probably listen to other coaches more than they do me because i am dad it is not as easy as people think it is i worry a lot because if roman misses a block people are going to know that is jesses son and that is an unfair expectation on my son
7287914 it is an exciting thing and i am sure he has the same worries he didnt play as long as i did but i remember him playing in those days i am sure he is worried about his son but i just hope that both of our kids do well
7287915 yeah i think about it i have realistic expectations because lynn swann and john stallworth just went in about five years ago and there are a lot of those guys because they were such a great dynasty that is going to have to wait in line i was one who played different positions for the san francisco 49ers and i made all pro at different positions so hopefully they take that into account hopefully i am still alive if i am fortunate enough to go in
7287916 i keep up i really do i went with june jones hawaiis previous coach and coach greg mcmackin to do a clinic in samoa last month it is good that they are all friends and help each other out i was at the sugar bowl i flew in from cleveland where the 49ers were playing we were all excited people talk about the result of the sugar bowl game but i think it was a major step forward for the budget for june for mcmackin to steal one of those bcs bids it is a miracle to go up against schools with those kinds of budgets and that kind of backing i think mcmackin will continue the success i think the strength of coach mack and june jones is they understand the local mentality the local mentality is if you are successful and very respectful and you walk around with humility they will carry you around if you come in and you are demanding and you are arrogant it is not something that local people take well to i think coach mack is the perfect fit after june
7287917 i do a lot of community relations with our corporate sponsors to make sure they stay with the team especially with the struggles that we are going through right now to make sure that they remember the good old days it was 20 years of winning and just be patient with free agency and stuff we are trying to build a good foundation i think we are on the right track
7287918 it makes you feel good that you made a difference in peoples lives it is a great job
7287919 im learning to play the piano mrs treble beary said you can tell me how to grow my musical talent like you grow your garden how can i do that
7287920 hi little bear im so glad that youre taking piano lessons
7287921 learning to play the piano is a lot like working in a garden let me show you something look at these tiny new leaves just peeking up from the soil i planted these impatiens from seeds just last week and theyre already coming up in time if i take good care of them theyll grow into a beautiful part of my garden
7287922 i can see the new leaves theyre really tiny but what do they have to do with my piano lessons
7287923 well little bear your music learning will grow just like these tiny leaves
7287924 i need the right tools and environment to care for my garden i plant the seeds where there is enough sunlight give them plenty of water and use my tools every day
7287925 i see you use a shovel a rake a hoe a wheel barrow and a watering can for your garden
7287926 but i cant play my piano with those tools and watering would just get my music all wet
7287927 of course not little bear that would be silly youll need other types of tools to play the piano
7287928 right now your piano skills are like these tiny new leaves coming up theyre small and fragile but over time they will grow strong just as it takes time for my garden to grow it will take time for your piano skills to grow did you notice that mrs treble beary has a vase of flowers on her piano
7287929 she keeps them on her piano to remind her students how much their musical skills have blossomed since they began taking lessons
7287930 i just had my first lesson and there is so much i still dont know
7287931 you will learn something new every day when i work in my garden i dont fret over how much it grows each day i just take patient care of it and know that at the end of the season i will have a harvest of beautiful flowers and lots of yummy fruits and vegetables to share you have to be patient with your learning little bear and give yourself time to grow just like i have to give these tiny flowers time to grow
7287932 here are some impatiens seeds like the ones i planted last week
7287933 take them home and plant them in your own yard remember though youll need to water and tend them every day right after practicing your piano lesson it will take time for both these flowers and your musical garden to grow but at the end of the year little bear the flowers will be all grown and beautiful and you will be amazed at how much your piano skills have grown too mrs green bear and i are looking forward to hearing you play at your first piano recital next spring
7287934 what if mrs treble beary doesnt like me what if she thinks i dont know enough
7287935 dont worry mrs treble beary loves teaching piano to young bears so im sure shell like you im also sure she doesnt expect you to know how to play yet after all thats why youre starting lessons
7287936 the piano is so big and im so small my arms wont even reach all the keys and my feet are too short to reach the pedals oh no im just too small this will never work
7287937 dont worry ill show you a way young bears can sit on the piano bench so they can reach all the keys and they can reach the pedals when they need to
7287938 so after my lesson today will i know how to play everything on the piano will i be able to play everything i hear on the radio can i start my own band and be on tv grandpa said my uncle max went to new york once to be on the teddy sullivan show
7287939 it will take time little bear for both you and your musical skills to grow i know two bears that live right here in musical acres forest who can help explain this to you do you know mr green bear the gardener
7287940 he won first prize for his flowers and vegetables i like to talk with him and help him in his garden
7287941 great you can ask mr green bear to tell you how your musical talent will grow like his garden also your grandpa bear builds clocks so he can tell you all about how time works
7287942 this is taking too long i know it will take time to learn how to play but how long is that going to be
7287943 my albeart you are in such a hurry i think you need to talk with your grandfather he can help you understand how long time is and why its important to be patient with yourself
7287944 hi grandpa ive started taking piano lessons but its taking a very very long time ive been playing for two whole weeks and i still dont know everything since you know all about time i want you to tell me how much longer it will take
7287945 you dont have to worry that its taking some time we all need time to learn and grow time can even help you learn to play the piano if you use it wisely
7287946 time takes so long so how could it help me learn to play how long did it take grandma to learn
7287947 well little bear did you know that grandma started playing piano when she was just your age
7287948 she learned a lot when she was growing up but she is still learning new things even now look at this old photograph of grandma with her piano teacher
7287949 what grandmas piano teacher wasnt a bear like us you mean people can play piano too
7287950 yes sure people can play piano and she was a wonderful piano teacher her name was mrs marktime she taught grandma how to follow a steady beat and keep time in her head
7287951 thats not what i mean a clock is a machine it can keep time but it cant grow or learn new things or think creatively look at this big clock im building for the town hall it looks complicated but its really pretty simple it can only do one thing keep the time with a steady tic toc tic toc tic toc thats all it cant change or grow or have new ideas or play soccer with its friends
7287952 time is important because it helps us pace ourselves it lets us keep track of how fast we should play a song or how long to practice every day but there is no such thing as how long it takes to learn everything instead you learn something new every day little bear you know more today than you did yesterday and you will learn more tomorrow than you know today some piano skills will take only a few minutes to learn while others will take you much longer but just like your mother doesnt measure your growth after every meal you shouldnt try to measure your piano progress every day
7287953 but youre right i dont try to measure my height every time i eat that would be silly
7287954 sure little bear you are a wonderful creation your growth isnt measured by minutes or hours but by seasons and years
7287955 each day you will grow and change and laugh and play and learn something new thats why for bears and people every day can be a brand new adventure
7287956 your piano skills are like the strawberries we planted in the garden from tiny seeds last spring it took all summer and we had to tend them but now they are full of blossoms and give us lots of yummy fruit your musical talent will grow the same way by the end of the year you will also have a harvest of beautiful music
7287957 im not like a clock youve finished building im still growing i guess i just have to be patient i do know how to play things on the piano that i didnt know how to play last week while it seems to be taking a long time i just have to keep working on it every day i guess that must be how you learned to build such beautiful clocks grandpa
7287958 thats exactly right little bear now you have the idea grandma melody and i are looking forward to hearing you play at your first piano recital at the end of the year thats an important measure of time and you will know lots of piano skills and songs by then
7287959 i want to play the piano can i sit on the bench too grandma
7287960 of course little bear hop up here next to me and play something
7287961 it sounds nice grandma but it isnt really a song how do you know what keys to play why are there white keys and black ones why do keys on this side of the piano sound low like daddys voice while on the other side they sound high like baby kisses and how do you read music when it doesnt have any words i want to play the piano grandma but i dont know where to begin how will i ever learn to play
7287962 little bear you arent supposed to know everything yet youll need a piano teacher like i had when i was a young bear
7287963 weve been hoping youd want to take piano lessons albeart
7287964 tomorrow papa bear and i will take you to meet mrs treble beary she teaches piano to lots of young bears at her studio in musical acres
7287965 its what you do when no one else is looking

7288030 our whole sideline erupted and you could see the other sideline deflated i think its a great boost for us and you can build off that for sure i wish it was the regular season
7288031 we feel like they can be great returners for us and were anticipating a lot more things from them as the season goes along
7288032 both of those guys are really good returners and thats one of the reasons we brought them in
7288033 desean runs that punt back right before the half so i dont have to go out there and run the two minute drill its just an entire momentum thing you start riding on that kind of stuff something sparks and there you go we have an opportunity to score some points with those two guys and thats something we havent had in a while
7288034 when you see people perform well it certainly runs and radiates throughout the whole team
7288035 i have to say thats the first time ive seen two return touchdowns
7288036 im a very versatile player and i feel like im capable of doing whatever is needed whether its getting open as a receiver or taking punt returns to the house

7288166 dengan menerima rm200 dan menyebabkan umno terus berkuasa serta melakukan pelbagai penyelewengan maka ia juga merupakan satu dosa tetapi jika mereka beri rm200 tanpa syarat ambil sahaja dan anggaplah ia rezeki kita lagipun duit itu memang umno curi dari poket kita

7288180 it is proper for all those who fear god to constantly be in pain and worry over the destruction of the holy temple

7288220 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that drug trials are essential in order to improve drug therapies
7288221 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part
7288222 it is invaluable to have an independent monitor who can swiftly question any adverse drug reactions or differences in illness and death rates between groups taking part in the clinical trials
7288223 parents also need to be made aware of the risks of adverse drug reactions when a child takes any medicine so that they can make informed decisions that balance those risks against the possible benefits the drug may provide their child
7288224 there is general agreement by pediatric health professionals regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry as well as politicians and parents that drug trials link are essential in order to improve drug therapies
7288225 we are calling for all pediatric drug trials to include independent safety monitoring committees to ensure that this vital work is carried out in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits for the children taking part
7288226 we need to test drugs on children as the only other options are to use unlicensed drugs or prescribe drugs that have been licensed for adults
7288227 but we feel that the small number of studies that reported having safety monitoring committees was unacceptable
7288228 we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace

7288232 verse 9 this means that the daily walk of the children of god are cleansed by the blood of jesus

7288256 i started pretty well but in corner 1 i went over the kerb and lewis was closing
7288257 in the second corner i was going to overtake lewis but i saw felipe braking quite early it would have been too much of a risk as i could end up overshooting the braking point and crashing into him over the next few laps i was consistently a bit slower than lewis suddenly i saw a white plastic bag flying across the track but could not avoid it and it went under the car i couldnt steer for two corners which was extremely dangerous fortunately most of the bag soon flew away but my confidence was very low over the next sector and i lost around three seconds in the end i finished third eventually i think my good qualifying result yesterday was crucial for todays result
7288258 this was one of the worst races ever for me to finish ninth in a car which is obviously good enough for third is a disaster after qualifying i was pretty confident because we realised we could go well but in the race i had big problems with the harder tyres during the first two stints and it was only better at the end with the softer compound i lost one position after the start and later in the race i couldnt gain any the pace wasnt there
7288259 first of all a big compliment to the organisers of the event for such a good first race the atmosphere in the city and at the circuit around the harbour is just fantastic from now on valencia will be one of the seasons highlights certainly we enjoyed being back on the podium with it being the fifth time this year for robert he drove a strong race during the early laps he had some trouble as a plastic bag was stuck on his car and affected its handling apart from this both cars ran trouble free and the pit stops went well starting from eighth was not an ideal situation for nick we were hoping he would improve one or two places at the start but in the heat of the moment he unfortunately lost a position and then the race was basically over for him

7288266 its horrible congress is on vacation and theyre probably soaking up the rays somewhere were soaking up high gas prices
7288267 more travelers concerned about the economy gasoline prices and rising airfares are opting to travel by train bus motorcycle and cruise ship to their holiday weekend destinations
7288268 nobody has enough gas money to fill up the truck so were not going anymore
7288269 its too expensive theres not enough money to rent a house like we normally do
7288270 some of my buddies couldnt afford it this year it just costs too much
7288271 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
7288272 in the next few months you should continue to see a slowdown
7288273 even in asia china is slowing down buyback activity may not pick up until early next year
7288274 a slowdown in buybacks unless there is some dramatic external change would be because corporate asia does not want to run its cash reserves down any further
7288275 earnings downgrades particularly for 2009 have got a way to go
7288276 the big picture problem is we have never had a credit crisis like this so no one is quite sure how long it will depress western demand
7288277 the pace of buybacks will depend on managements view on the economy
7288278 so if the economy deteriorates more sharply then the company will need to retain more cash so far the consensus is earnings growth and economic development will improve over 2008
7288279 theres a good idea shove them all in and throw away the key
7288280 but it was quickly becoming irrelevant in the minds of young people
7288281 smoke filled bars twenty year olds do not find that attractive
7288282 i would invite all veterans to come stand with us
7288283 that may be as simple as mowing the yard or helping with health care or just being a friendly face and a smile when they are down
7288284 people come home and the brotherhood the camaraderie is gone right when you may need it the most
7288285 we may need to change the ways we deliver the information
7288286 but the needs of todays veterans are the same as the world war i veterans we know that

7288318 search was a very large portion of our demand in fiscal year 2008

7288322 albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
7288323 we absolutely should crack down on piracy people put a lot of blood sweat and tears into their content and deserve to get paid for it its absolutely wrong it is stealing
7288324 but at the same time i think there are better solutions than chasing people for money im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
7288325 if we learned anything from the music business they just dont win any friends by suing their consumers speaking personally i think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music

7288358 were improving the morale welfare and recreation center chow hall and the gym
7288359 the mwr center will be in the existing chow hall
7288360 the internet center will increase from 700 square feet to about 2 800 and feature more phones computers pool tables and televisions
7288361 the chow hall will support nearly twice as many marines as before
7288362 the biggest improvement so far is that we will go from two hot meals per day to four
7288363 when we got here we hardly had any equipment in the gym
7288364 another unit loaned us some machines and army maintenance welded bars for us all units helped out to make the gym as nice as it could be
7288365 the gym gives marines something to look forward to and something to do
7288366 its a good way to let go of stress and extra energy the new gym will open up a lot of equipment for more people and they can get in and out of the gym quicker
7288367 a lot of the permanent personnel were living in tents and now they live in hard structures which improve their quality of life quite a bit
7288368 the 3rd armored calvary regiment regularly has folks from different fobs use us because of our work in the past
7288369 unless there is a part that needs to be sent off or ordered we can fix an item and get it back to you the same day
7288370 when a unit gets that piece of equipment back they know weve tested it and it is well within standard s
7288371 humidity and temperature are big factors of things that can affect electronic equipment you have to use operator common sense going back to the operators manual looking at how to use the equipment and what it is capable of
7288372 maybe people dont have a chance to keep equipment within its operating parameters
7288373 but if soldiers go outside of those parameters theres no guarantee that their signal will be operating where we calibrate it at
7288374 when someone uses their test equipment they need to know the equipment is accurate and reliable
7288375 airdrop capability is indicative of the asymmetric advantages of airpower throughout the u s central commands area of responsibility
7288376 our u s air force and coalition air forces capability to airdrop supplies to our ground forces in isolated environments allows the collective forces to maintain the pressure on the enemy in many places in afghanistan our airdrops are the sole source of resupply to ground forces
7288377 the ability to provide this resupply in both routine and emergency situations is very rewarding for our aircrews and the joint service support crews that prepare the airdrop cargo from rigging the bundles to loading the aircraft
7288378 this particular airdrop milestone marks the greatest amount of combat resupply in a single year since hostilities began in 2001
7288379 our ability to airdrop supplies and equipment from our and allows to us to continually take the fight to enemy ground forces because friendly forces get the supplies they need when they need them
7288380 the airdrop mission has been focused in afghanistan because the lack of infrastructure there has made it difficult to resupply overland
7288381 as coalition forces have increased their presence at forward operating bases throughout afghanistan the demand for combat airdrop resupply has increased as well
7288382 it has to be frustrating for an enemy to know that we can choose the time and place that we resupply our forces on the ground
7288383 particularly when the enemy must receive their supplies from overland sources in some of the most inaccessible real estate on the planet

7288390 its probable according to statements made to us that the climbers roped together were on the path up the mountain and in the place where the block of ice tumbled down
7288391 we have also called in the army to assist the police in enforcing law and order
7288392 if at all we have threats from any quarter its from indian forces
7288393 the government is unnerved by the nonviolent mass uprising and is now trying to use its old tactic to try to break the will of people
7288394 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7288395 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7288396 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7288397 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7288398 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7288399 how can i feed my family how can i give my children a future
7288400 thats what i am asking god every day every single day
7288401 the restaurant is just down the street from the police post that was blown up
7288402 his office is across from the courthouse you know the one where that attack happened
7288403 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7288404 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7288405 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7288406 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7288407 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7288408 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7288409 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7288410 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you
7288411 one to america one to canada two more to the u k
7288412 so instead of talking conservation lets get to the real issue the illinois political climate that has allowed this to happen
7288413 from that moment i felt i could not go back to my house again
7288414 you trust your neighbor but you dont know who is five or six doors down
7288415 that really changed the dads mind about how wise kids are using technology
7288416 his point was that schools shouldnt ban the use of the devices but learn from the students and also create an environment that promotes technology
7288417 its exciting but i think we need to stay focused on what the outcomes are for kids as far as content
7288418 if a student brings their own laptop is it going to be on the schools network then what about viruses and filtering
7288419 im not sure schools are quite comfortable with it yet
7288420 one of the things weve talked about in proctor and west rutland because we have the small schools is maintaining the diversity of classes with a low enrollment with the camera software we could perhaps offer the class at one school and have students at the other taking it
7288421 what people are most excited about and interested in is all the negative stuff out there i liken the experience to taking your kids to washington d c there are streets that you better not let them go down and there are others that they shouldnt die without seeing
7288422 how do you accommodate the students that dont have the technology how do you equalize the access
7288423 its a way we can introduce math concepts without any kind of stress on the student without them having to memorize a bunch of rules first
7288424 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7288425 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant

7288555 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem
7288556 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly

7288652 no formal claim of responsibility was made and the motive for the kidnapping remains unknown there have been no demands
7288653 it is not clear whether they are being held for political purposes bargaining chips or financial purposes
7288654 but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seems to be a pre planned attack
7288655 we are appalled by this cruel abduction of journalists and call for the immediate release of our colleagues who are being held captive because of their noble work for the somali people
7288656 we demand that those holding abdifatah mohammed elmi nigel brenan and amanda lindhout free them unconditionally and immediately
7288657 we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding three journalists and their driver
7288658 some of the information we are getting so far indicates that the journalists were kidnapped by freelance militias who want a ransom
7288659 we are deeply concerned that our son may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7288660 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somali authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel

7288750 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7288751 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7288752 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7288753 the young guys coming up that want to be a part of this make sure you have right mindset
7288754 thats be unselfish with everything its not about you shining its about the team shining
7288755 they had a bad start before they left for athens in 2004 but with lebron and those guys coming back for this and telling everyone how cool it is its going to be a hot ticket theres going to be a lot of competition to play for this team

7288765 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7288766 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7288767 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7288768 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7288769 without a doubt have failed to live up to their obligations under the ceasefire agreement
7288770 establishing check points and buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7288771 may only be implemented in the immediate proximity of south ossetia to the exclusion of any other part of georgian territory
7288772 inside a zone of a depth of a few kilometers from the administrative limit between south ossetia and the rest of georgia in a manner such that no significant urban zone would be included
7288773 so the russian side has complied with the agreements recorded in moscows medvedev sarkozy principles

7288799 but journalists who spoke on condition of anonymity for their security said the abduction seems to be a pre planned attack

7288804 we are deeply concerned that our son may have gone missing near mogadishu in somalia yesterday he is a freelance photographer who arrived in kenya just over a week ago
7288805 we understand that the australian government is making urgent contact with relevant somali authorities as well as the canadian french and british embassies to help locate nigel

7288837 o my gosh shes exploring same sex attractions she must be a lesbian
7288838 girls making out with each other to turn on guys is the latest craze at high school and college parties
7288839 and the kissing itself didnt really bug me from then on it became a normal thing to do
7288840 youre turning on a guy and he thinks its cool
7288841 the term for the im straight but ill kiss girls mentality is heteroflexible
7288842 theyre doing it because they want to appeal to boys their age and for boys their age whove developed sexually alongside internet porn their sexual cues are affected by the norms and standards of porn and thats girl on girl action
7288843 the joint has been infiltrated by a gaggle of giggling straight girls playing gay for a night because it amuses them
7288844 difficult to distinguish between the behavior of someone who is legitimately sexually interested and someone who wants to impress the boy across the room
7288845 a lot of girls who do want long term boyfriends will still settle for the hookup triggered by girl on girl kissing because it gives them that temporary feeling of being taken care of and being close to someone
7288846 its sad to see that this is what its come to that guys will raise the bar and girls will scramble to meet it women just want to know what they have to do to get these guys to fall in love with them

7288852 saddam must be dislodged from his weapons or dislodged from power
7288853 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after
7288854 well the point is it turned out they didnt but everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them he catalogued they catalogued them this was not some some cheney you know pipe dream this was in fact catalogued
7288855 the threat saddam hussein presented was that if saddam was left unfettered which i said during that period for the next five years with sanctions lifted and billions of dollars into his coffers then i believed he had the ability to acquire a tactical nuclear weapon not by building it by purchasing it
7288856 we can call it quits and withdraw from iraq i think that would be a gigantic mistake or we can set a deadline for pulling out which i fear will only encourage our enemies to wait us out equally a mistake
7288857 if he surges another 20 30 or whatever number hes going to into baghdad itll be a tragic mistake in my view but as a practical matter theres no way to say mr
7288858 i mean the truth of the matter is that that the americas this administrations policy and the surge are a failure and that the surge which was supposed to stop sectarian violence and long enough to give political reconciliation theres been no political reconciliation the reality is that although there has been some mild progress on the security front there is in fact no no real security in baghdad and or in anbar province where i was dealing with the most serious problem sectarian violence sectarian violence is as strong and as solid and as serious a problem as it was before the surge started
7288859 a funny story from this time that al miller likes to tell has to do with the atari basic cartridge that was to ship with the system atari had contracted with a young programmer named bill gates to modify a basic compiler that he had for another system to be used on the 800 after that project stalled for over a year al was called upon to replace him with another developer so while al is the only person i know ever to have fired bill gates i suspect that rather than work on atari basic gates was spending all his time on dos for ibm probably not a bad career choice for him do you think
7288860 video chess was created when a consumer from florida sued atari because there was a chess piece pictured on the systems box but no game was available the vcs programmers did not think a chess game would be possible on the vcs but with some alternating scan line tricks they got it to work

7288905 but we soon realized that the identity the government was introducing also was not exactly who we were
7288906 there has been this constant onslaught on our identity and the reaction has always been to return to that deepest identity inside every iranian there is an emperor or an empress that is for sure

7288917 she pleaded that she would join me and alight at a place where she could conveniently get a car to kaneshie and i obliged
7288918 after the call the woman acted in a funny way and asked me to stop the car for her to alight i asked her to wait till i got to a bus stop but she wouldnt listen and forcibly opened the door and got down in the middle of the road

7288938 when i said tibet tibet i whispered it three times there was no fuss in the room it happened afterwards on websites it is interesting to note how bjork cunningly turned an oh so quiet whisper to a scream hypocritically using the very media channels that she claims to hate in order to amplify her own agendas this is the very same person who laid down draconian media conditions for playing in shanghai and in her own immature and byzantine way threatened to cancel her show if any reporter was present at the airport in shanghai not to mention that shes violently happy to use fear and intimidation to keep reporters at bay at the threat of bodily harm touche army of me in repressive regime impersonation anyway those whispered words then spawned the many subsequent reports in the western media supporting bjork s stand which were diametrically opposed by the chinese viewpoint on the street which is best summed up by a commenter named adam on the when bjork declare d tibet in her shanghai concert yeah it is pretty good for her edgy image but have has this singer thought any consequence that might be caused to those who invited her to china has she thought anything about the feeling of her chinese fans i believe they are in support of a united tibet with china tibet is a complicated issue behavior like bjork did nothing to solve the whole situation in retrospect the only consequence might be that any singer with similar style will be more difficult to be invited to sing in china in the future of course this is not the business of bjork bjork is certainly entitled to her political views but by airing them in china upon invitation of her hosts and the paying chinese fans her conduct was tantamount to biting the hand that feeds not only did it flout clearly spelt out rules and laws but it was also a betrayal of the very people she used who had strived to pave her way into china in the first place her concert promoter emma ticketmaster and the licensing agent the shanghai municipal performance company smpc now await their fate while bjork continues smugly on her merry jaunt on her high horse oblivious to the fact that the smpc might even possibly lose its license for a few years john siegel from china west entertainment pointed out it is unfortunate that this has happened i know artists have to stand up for their beliefs but she cant expect to accomplish any good in doing what she did
7288939 foreign artistic troupes and artists should voluntarily observe relevant laws and regulations of china when they come to perform on chinese soil
7288940 not only broke chinese laws and regulations and hurt the feelings of chinese people but also went against the professional code of an artist we will further tighten controls on foreign artists performing in china in order to prevent similar cases from happening in the future
7288941 i have been asked by many for a statement after dedicating my song declare independence to both kosovo and tibet on different occasions i would like to put importance on that i am not a politician i am first and last a musician and as such i feel my duty to try to express the whole range of human emotions the urge for declaring independence is just one of them but an important one we all feel at some times in our lives this song was written more with the personal in mind but the fact that it has translated to its broadest meaning the struggle of a suppressed nation gives me much pleasure i would like to wish all individuals and nations good luck in their battle for independence justice
7288942 due to circumstances beyond my control i was not able to give my fans in china the show i intended

7288944 are not subject to review by the wto appellate body antigua would however retain the right to have wto reassess the damage award should online gambling in the us expand and generate even more revenues beyond the wto s current estimation
7288945 the u s is not behaving as one would expect one day they re out there saying how scandalous it is that china doesn t respect w t o decisions but then the next day there s a dispute that doesn t go their way and their attitude is the decision is completely wrong these judges don t know what they re doing why should we comply
7288946 antigua cannot be vilified by the united states government as criminals as they will not actually be breaking copyright and piracy laws
7288947 antigua was not aiming for this judgement rather they simply would like for the us to follow the rules of the wto by allowing antiguan gaming operators to offer horse race betting to americans just as american gaming operators are currently allowed to do until they do meet the legalities of the wto rulings it will be legal to sell copyrighted materials
7288948 it sounds like a contradiction in terms but there we have it the tiny caribbean nation of antigua is now allowed the right to distribute music movies and software produced in the us without obligations to pay us rights holders

7288959 look we didnt hire him for his stunning good looks obama campaign adviser robert gibbs said of the senator from delaware this morning on
7288960 we hired him for his judgment to lead this country if something happens to barack obama and the judgment and the advice that hell give the next president of the united states and we think weve got a fabulous pick
7288961 weve got somebody who hasnt forgotten where theyre from and somebody who can help rebuild this country
7288962 he picked somebody who has unparalleled expertise on foreign policy somebody who will help him rebuild the economy put people back to work make our country independent of energy
7288963 somebody that works in washington but doesnt live there and i think that says a lot about him doesnt forget where hes from i think it says a lot about who he picked he goes every night he goes home on an amtrak train where he knows the names of the conductors to his wife and family in delaware

7288971 but we have the legal responsibility to act on allegations of a felony crime
7288972 weve gone from being characterized as environmental terrorists to being embraced this is like falling down a rabbit hole i feel like alice in wonderland
7288973 its been unbelievable to me that this has happened but this isnt my victory i just sat on guard

7288979 if proposition 8 fails there is an inevitable loss of religious freedom
7288980 i will defend to my last breath the right of any of those folks to exercise their religion as they believe they are called to do it
7288981 but ill resist to my last breath vote e mail and blog their right to inflict their religious beliefs on the constitution of the state of california
7288982 i absolutely think that jesus would support the freedom to marry and because of that as a follower of jesus it is absolutely incumbent upon me to support the freedom to marry as well
7288983 my faith supports the freedom to marry because as a jew i have a responsibility to fight for what is right and to help bring goodness into the world
7288984 the two icons of the games were michael phelps and usain bolt
7288985 its important that our teams do well because so many kids get their start in sports on a team
7288986 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish and arrogant and individuals
7288987 but what you saw today was a team bonding and facing adversity and coming out with a big win
7288988 he likes to have the ball down the stretch and take care of those big plays down the stretch im familiar with that
7288989 kobe hes a special player hes the best player on the planet right now
7288990 kobe loves that situation if he has the ball and we need a basket we know we can count on him
7288991 its nice that you can get a twofer with one of the heaviest hitters on foreign policy in the senate and also get someone who has the capacity to reach these lunch bucket voters
7288992 single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids
7288993 hes still one of the poorest members of the senate

7288995 most of those who are disappointed that hillary clinton was chosen will readily concede that joe biden is a solid choice and highly qualified avoiding some of the hard feelings that might have occurred if some of the lesser experienced contenders had been selected
7288996 if its a referendum on obama then the question is much less about how bad bush and mccain are and about how good really is obama
7288997 and thats where the doubts that the republicans have tried to create begin to seep in
7288998 if we can get through this season we can get through anything
7288999 people are definitely in a more conservative mode than they have been in recent years in figuring out how to save in different ways once they get here
7289000 i think its been a fantastic summer people didnt stop coming to the shore
7289001 people are still coming to the shore we know that because our rentals are at least comparable with last year
7289002 our cleaning people are telling us they have never had to spend so much time cleaning the kitchens between weekly rentals
7289003 that tells me that people are staying in rather than going out to the restaurants for every meal
7289004 what kind of summer it will ultimately be for the entire shore economy
7289005 lunches have been slow and weve had a couple of weeks that were slow in the beginning of the summer for lunch and dinner
7289006 besides good weather i think that people finally came to the conclusion that they werent going to let a tankful of a gas stop them from taking a vacation
7289007 instead of buying an appetizer and dessert with their dinner theyre just buying the dinner
7289008 in the early part of july you could have driven down on a saturday morning and gone right into a house that you found that day
7289009 its a tough year all around probably one of the toughest years weve had in a while
7289010 the same number of people might be here but instead of buying a seafood dinner theyre getting a piece of pizza
7289011 that ultimately erodes the profit margin maybe were all holding our own but its tough

7289013 ich hatte einen guten start in das rennen und machte drei pl tze bis auf position 13 gut aber das war f r mich wirklich der h hepunkt des rennens
7289014 wir haben es uns selbst schwer gemacht indem wir uns so weit hinten in der startaufstellung qualifiziert haben nachdem wir erwartet hatten eine wesentlich bessere leistung zu zeigen
7289015 im vergleich zu den meisten anderen hatte ich ziemlich viel benzin an bord und fuhr auf einer ein boxenstopp strategie lang aber ich hing hinter heidfeld fest als er schon an die box gekommen war was mich etwas zeit kostete da ich nicht die geschwindigkeit hatte um ihn zu berholen wir fuhren beim zweiten abschnitt des rennens den weicheren reifen dieser war anfangs gut aber dann bauten die hinterreifen ziemlich stark ab da die hinteren bremsen berhitzten
7289016 nach dem qualifying nutzen wir die chance aus der boxengasse zu starten und arbeiteten am auto um zu versuchen die probleme zu beheben die wir gestern hatten
7289017 wir tauschten die bremsen komplett aus das auto war aus diesem grund v llig anders zu fahren aber es verbesserte sich w hrend des rennens ein wenig wir m ssen die probleme mit den bremsen in den griff bekommen die wir das ganze wochenende ber hatten da sie mich viel zeit und positionen gekostet haben alles in allem war es ein schwaches wochenende
7289018 jenson gelang ein guter start und er war in der lage w hrend der ersten runde drei pl tze gutzumachen
7289019 das mittelfeld lag heute jedoch eng zusammen und mit viel benzin an bord war er nicht in der lage im feld weiter nach vorn zu kommen
7289020 mit rubens aus der boxengasse zu starten war die richtige entscheidung da er von dem durcheinander in der zweiten kurve profitierte und weiter im feld vorne endete als dies ansonsten der fall gewesen w re
7289021 im gegensatz zu den erwartungen gab es jedoch relativ wenig aufregung denn lediglich drei autos schafften es nicht das ziel zu sehen zudem gab es kein safety car was bedeutete dass es keine wirklichen chancen gab aus denen man einen vorteil h tte ziehen k nnen
7289022 grunds tzlich haben wir das auto w hrend der august pause verbessert und wir sahen klare zeichen dieser fortschritte im freien training als es an diesem wochenende z hlte machten wir nicht das maximum daraus und wir litten als ergebnis dessen im qualifying und im rennen darunter
7289023 unsere erste priorit t wird aus diesem grund darauf liegen zu verstehen wo wir gescheitert sind und sicherzustellen dass wir in spa und danach eine robustere herangehensweise an den tag legen wir haben in der kommenden woche in monza einen dreit gigen test bei dem wir uns darauf konzentrieren werden das maximum aus unserem k rzlich vorgenommenen entwicklungen zu machen

7289047 i decided some time ago that ill say nothing about the liberal party leadership and particularly about that costellos future
7289048 everyone else is commenting on it so ill just leave it to others
7289049 the only leadership issue im interested in talking about is the lack of leadership from kevin rudd and treasurer wayne swan
7289050 i would expect it would be around that time that he would make it clear what his future intentions are
7289051 from my perspective peter costello has earned the right to make the decision in his good time with his family and his electors and announce it when it suits him and i expect that will be very soon
7289052 weve had all year a treasurer who is the only treasurer in the whole world that has been talking down his own economy and talking up inflation
7289053 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class

7289090 we knew that we wouldnt have much time to record because we were about to go shoot camp rock and right after that wed be on tour with miley
7289091 so we asked our management team how can we get into the studio to do this we wound up bringing a tour bus out on the road that was retro fitted to be a studio
7289092 obviously there were some vocal things that needed to be redone and some drums because youd have the generator of the bus in the background
7289093 so when we finished the tour we went into the studio to make a couple of fixes here and there and basically the rest of it was done

7289124 i had a good start to the race and gained three places to 13th but that was the highlight of my race really we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid after we had expected to perform a lot better i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
7289125 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pit lane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race we need to get to the bottom of the brake problems that we have had all weekend as these cost me a lot of time and positions it was a poor weekend overall
7289126 jenson got a good start and was able to make up three places during the first lap however the midfield was quite close today and with a heavy fuel load he was unable to progress through the field starting rubens from the pit lane was the right decision as he benefited from the mel e at turn 2 and ended up being further up the field than he would otherwise have been contrary to expectation though there was relatively low attrition with only three cars failing to finish and no safety cars which meant there were no real opportunities to take advantage of
7289127 im pretty happy with that its good to be going home with a point today as its been a long time since it happened the race went quite well for me and i was giving it my all driving what felt like qualifying laps one after the other the result is also good for the team as it shows we are getting back on track once again i would like to say that valencia has done a great job here and the race was good fun
7289128 i had a bad start and we have to find the reason for that on lap one going into turns four and five i was just behind alonso but there was a bit of a battle going on in front and i couldnt avoid him going into the corner after that i just tried to be consistent my pace was ok but i was behind barrichello and it was really difficult to overtake eventually i made it past him and my pace improved but it was too late

7289140 the first stint was ok as i was closing the gap to the rest of the field and then i could pass a few cars in the hairpin it was a shame that i couldnt pass giancarlo quickly enough to take full advantage of the two stop strategy and lost a little time once i passed him it was getting better but it was still difficult to pass more cars then under braking i lost the rear and tried to avoid a crash but the barrier was too close and that was it
7289141 it was a difficult race with the very hot conditions but overall i think it was a good performance the strategy wasnt bad but we did expect a safety car after seeing the other support races but there werent any incidents so it didnt come our pace was good it wasnt far off the others and we made a step forward with the gearbox we now have to keep focussed and keep moving forward
7289142 although it was disappointing not to get two cars to the finish both drivers drove excellent races with good pace showing wed made a clear step forward adrian was honest enough to admit he made a mistake but until that point he was having a very good race we had put one car on one stop and the other on two to cover all bases in case of a safety car which we were expecting for this race and had he finished adrian on his two stops would have been able to finish just behind giancarlo overall its been a very positive weekend for the team
7289143 i started pretty well but in corner 1 i went over the kerb and lewis was closing in the second corner i was going to overtake lewis but i saw felipe braking quite early it would have been too much of a risk as i could end up overshooting the braking point and crashing into him over the next few laps i was consistently a bit slower than lewis suddenly i saw a white plastic bag flying across the track but could not avoid it and it went under the car i couldnt steer for two corners which was extremely dangerous fortunately most of the bag soon flew away but my confidence was very low over the next sector and i lost around three seconds in the end i finished third eventually i think my good qualifying result yesterday was crucial for todays result
7289144 this was one of the worst races ever for me to finish ninth in a car which is obviously good enough for third is a disaster after qualifying i was pretty confident because we realised we could go well but in the race i had big problems with the harder tyres during the first two stints and it was only better at the end with the softer compound i lost one position after the start and later in the race i couldnt gain any the pace wasnt there
7289145 first of all a big compliment to the organisers of the event for such a good first race the atmosphere in the city and at the circuit around the harbour is just fantastic from now on valencia will be one of the seasons highlights certainly we enjoyed being back on the podium with it being the fifth time this year for robert he drove a strong race during the early laps he had some trouble as a plastic bag was stuck on his car and affected its handling apart from this both cars ran trouble free and the pit stops went well starting from eighth was not an ideal situation for nick we were hoping he would improve one or two places at the start but in the heat of the moment he unfortunately lost a position and then the race was basically over for him
7289146 we the ohrc are therefore pleased to see that the draft policies mention the code and list the prohibited grounds of discrimination in service provision we suggest that given the significant and ongoing discrimination faced by transgendered people and those perceived to be gender variant the college add clarification that the code protections relating to sex also include gender identity and expression
7289147 the commissions concerns focus on the draft policys handling of discretionary decisions made by doctors in accepting patients and in provision of care as currently stands the draft policy may in fact lead to confusion and to human rights complaints
7289148 the use of discretion is problematic in that options that sanction the use of discretion leave the door open for discriminatory approaches the only way to avoid these entirely would be through a first come first served approach as you suggest at lines 66 67 if the college were to clearly direct physicians to use this approach many discriminatory practices may be eliminated
7289149 for example a physician whose practice specializes in treating and assisting patients who have tested hiv positive may well have a
7289150 on the other hand a physician whose practice purports to focus on
7289151 unless a physician has specific restrictions on his or her licence imposed by the college precluding him or her from treating specific persons we can see almost no basis for alleged
7289152 the commission has heard concerns that some physicians responses to health service requests from particular individuals while using reference to
7289153 there must be an actual demonstrable link between the health service request or care needs being presented to the physician and any denial of service based on
7289154 the vision of the anointed self congratulation as the basis of social policy
7289155 while the expression of their religious beliefs is essential for religious officials in the performance of their duties
7289156 the right to equal treatment without discrimination because of sex includes the right to equal treatment without discrimination because a woman is or may become pregnant
7289157 we didnt come out trying to prove anything against those guys
7289158 we just wanted to prove to ourselves that we can do it
7289159 it meant something because we were looking to getting that first one out of the way
7289160 i was just trying to get some pressure on him and affect his throw
7289161 but i saw it open up and i went in there and got him
7289162 we did a lot of base stuff and thats good we wanted to get pressure with our base fronts and whenever you can do that youll be successful
7289163 for some reason everybody was honed in and it paid off whenever you can get a pass rush like today it just makes everybodys job easier
7289164 youre always happy with that kind of production and a lot of different guys were involved
7289165 we were working on some different things with the pressure package and to see those work was positive
7289166 we needed to put more pressure on the quarterback and help the rest of the defense out

7289175 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7289176 i am a long standing supporter of roe v wade and a womans right to choose
7289177 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7289178 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7289179 i am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7289180 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7289181 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy
7289182 this has always been clear and modern genetic science offers clear confirmation it has demonstrated that from the first instant there is established the programme of what this living being will be a person this individual person with his characteristic aspects already well determined right from fertilization the adventure of a human life begins and each of its capacities requires time a rather lengthy time to find its place and to be in a position to act
7289183 the texts of sacred scripture never address the question of deliberate abortion and so do not directly and specifically condemn it but they show such great respect for the human being in the mothers womb that they require as a logical consequence that gods commandment you shall not kill be extended to the unborn child as well
7289184 blessed are you simon bar jona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the powers of death shall not prevail against it i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7289185 whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
7289186 listen i know you are god and all that but i really think you got it wrong with this church authority thing i just dont think those old men holy as they might be are qualified to tell me how i should live my life i understand right from wrong i know how to be a good person i can follow your example and feed the hungry clothe the naked etc i dont need all that extra stuff thanks anyway
7289187 takes little trouble to find out what is true and good or when conscience is by degrees almost blinded through the habit of committing sin in such cases the person is culpable for the evil he commits

7289219 if you cant pay off the total amount owing on your credit card every month you are allowing yourself to be fleeced by the banks they charge you up to 27 percent interest on the total amount that you have yet to repay the ideal solution is to cut up your card

7289305 of course i am frustrated but when you lose a game it is not always the solution to buy
7289306 we did not create enough chances and have to look at why and how we can do it better i didnt feel we were into the game right from the start and you cant be like that
7289307 we had problems as well to win our early games last year but we did win them and it made things easier now we have to respond
7289308 but lets not make comparisons with this team and last seasons team because it is not a lot different if it is better only the future will tell us that
7289309 it was not excusable to concede a goal like that
7289310 ill always remember it but the most important thing was that it earned us a big three points
7289311 you could tell how much our winner meant to the fans the roof came off when my goal went in
7289312 everyone knows that these are the games we have to win if we are going to mount a serious title challenge too many home points were squandered last season
7289313 maybe our fans were thinking of what happened last season when we drew too many games at home
7289314 but this time we have sent out a message that we can produce results like this
7289315 last season we had some bad home results but this time around we have tried very hard to be positive and to make sure such things do not happen again this win shows we can do it
7289316 ive had problems with my groin throughout pre season and things have not gone the way i wanted them to
7289317 i have missed a lot of training and i am a couple of weeks behind the other lads when it comes to match fitness
7289318 the only way i am going to get that edge again is to get out on the pitch and play
7289319 i am not at my best at the moment but i hope the fans will be patient because i am only three weeks away from my best form and fitness
7289320 gerrard has quality he can score the sort of goal he got he has that ability right at the death he has done it before and he will continue to have the mentality to win games at the end
7289321 we sent a lot of players forward the idea was to have many people around their box it does leave us open to a counter attack but it is a gamble we will take
7289322 we know we did not play well but you have to win games like this if you want to be contenders for the title it is a message for everyone for the rest of the season
7289323 he likes our game he likes the team in this game only this portsmouth game nothing more than that
7289324 some players said to me it was a very good pitch but if not we need to change we need to play some high balls
7289325 but we need to play and we need to think about this i dont have players for long ball because deco is short ashley cole is not tall we need to try
7289326 wigan is near manchester its five hours by car from cobham
7289327 its in the north of england and more important than this its a good team strong team good physically and they play well
7289328 i know the players heskey amr zaki and olivier kapo luis antonio valencia and wilson palacios because they are south americans
7289329 heskey is difficult for a stopper to mark because he uses his body he jumps very well and hes smart
7289330 mevrouw dat kunt u ook aan mij vragen ik zit in de rolstoel en ik ben geen rolstoel en bovendien ik kan heel goed praten
7289331 one day you finally knew what you had to do and began
7289332 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes or so we created a lot of chances and could have scored a couple
7289333 but after that we did not play well and we allowed them to control our attacks they did not create too much themselves but it was not a good performance from our team
7289334 then in the second half they scored a good goal and we had to throw people forward to get ourselves back in the game
7289335 i am sure that jamie carragher will be claiming that goal despite the deflection but afterwards he was only really concerned that we had got ourselves level
7289336 but it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7289337 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7289338 we deserved more we certainly deserved a point we produced a disciplined performance and the two matches we have played so far have given me plenty of confidence
7289339 their equaliser was a freak and we should have been able to see out the game even at 1 1
7289340 but i have told them that they can leave anfield with their heads high

7289342 damn why should i even wake up now i have nothing to look forward to
7289343 we were not sharp enough in the first half and our passing was certainly not as good as we expect it to be i dont know why
7289344 we dominated the second half but i felt in the last 25 minutes we were too nervous and wanted to just hit the ball up there rather than create a chance
7289345 of course it is a setback but the result is there and we have to make up for it by winning the next match we have a big game on wednesday in the champions league and need to improve
7289346 we paid a big price for the mistake on their goal we should be able to cope with a corner when it comes in at low level like that
7289347 you are right that is a fact but we have to face it because from all our possession we could not produce many chances frankly the performance was just not good enough
7289348 i thought we played well for 70 minutes but perhaps in the last 15 or 20 we were guilty of trying too hard to just cling on to the lead and moved away from the style
7289349 it is dangerous to invite teams especially teams of this quality on to you but thats what we did in the end the ball was in and around our penalty area far too much
7289350 i dont want this to sound too critical though ive seen the best defensive performance by us since ive been here but i like best the
7289351 to be fair its heartening that when our backs are against the wall we can produce the necessary fighting spirit
7289352 i had him for a year and a half at viking stavanger in norway and hes still a good player both defensively and at set pieces
7289353 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7289354 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities
7289355 there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7289356 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs
7289357 i have got into a lot more goalscoring opportunities during pre season but didnt manage to score
7289358 but the mere fact i was getting into the right positions was a good sign
7289359 that is what you fight every day in training for you want to try and improve and you achieve that by pitting yourself against the best
7289360 but it is not going to be easy you dont get many harder games than a trip to fratton park we have had some poor results down there over the past few years
7289361 it is something we are looking to rectify because we have a run of three away games around the super cup and internationals
7289362 we gaan geen flikker uitvoeren maar we moeten de pati nt gewoon zoet houden
7289363 on an issue like partial birth abortion i strongly believe that the state can properly restrict late term abortions i have said so repeatedly all ive said is we should have a provision to protect the health of the mother and many of the bills that came before me didnt have that
7289364 now part of the reason they didnt have the health exception was purposeful because those who are opposed to abortion and i dont begrudge that at all they have a moral calling to try to oppose what they think is immoral
7289365 oftentimes what they were trying to do was to polarize the debate and make it more difficult for people so that they could try to bring an end to abortions overall
7289366 theres a lot at stake in this election especially for our daughters to appreciate that all you have to do is review the recent decisions handed down by the supreme court of the united states
7289367 for the first time in gonzales versus carhart the supreme court held upheld a federal ban ions with criminal penalties for doctors
7289368 some people argue that the federal ban ion was just an isolated effort aimed at one medical procedure that its not part of a concerted effort to roll back the hard won rights of american women that presumption is also wrong
7289369 nowhere in his speech is there any concern over the unborn child who is stabbed in the back of the neck while her head remains inside her mother

7289432 i dont think i am back to my best yet i am still looking to enjoy my football but i am starting to like it again because i am playing more games and the more i play the more i learn how chelsea play and i think the more i play the more confidence i will have

7289438 the icc board agreed unanimously to postpone the icc champions trophy scheduled to take place in pakistan next month until october 2009
7289439 pakistan will retain the right to host the tournament but it was agreed that if other members continued to express reservations over issues of safety and security then the icc board would have the right to decide about the tournaments location
7289440 there was complete support and sympathy for pakistan and the situation it finds itself in which is not of its making however there was also a realisation that under the current circumstances some of the teams due to compete had reservations about touring there which could not be removed
7289441 in those circumstances it was considered prudent to postpone the event to october 2009 a time when we all hope conditions may be more acceptable for all the competing teams
7289442 every one of our members wishes to ensure the champions trophy is a world class event and the prospect of relocating it at short notice in order to make sure it was played this year would not allow that criterion to be fulfilled
7289443 sundays agreement provides clarity for our members and in september we will look to put in place a timeframe for arrangements ahead of the event taking place in 2009
7289444 we are naturally disappointed but in a way the postponement is a victory for us under these circumstances there were only two solutions either to relocate the event to sri lanka or postpone it
7289445 had it been relocated it would have deprived us of the hosting rights
7289446 we are sure that the event will be held in pakistan next year
7289447 we are thankful to the icc for their support and to india who backed us in all these matters

7289673 sister phibby patroll as the most excellent midwife of the banana bottom region was credited with knowing more about the troubles and secrets of village families than any other person and what she did not know she conjectured since the death of her husband who had been the best barbecue builder of banana bottom she had been read out of church membership exactly three times and her cases had provided the most entertaining members meeting in the history of banana bottom for among sacred entertainments there was none to challenge that that was held when the members of a church were summoned by the parson to a general meeting to review the lapses of transgressors and backsliders sister phibbys first trial came when she was surprised in adultery with the village shopkeeper whose wife she was attending in childbirth but after adequate suspension she sought redemption and was received back into the fold again the second shock came five years after her husbands death as a redeemed communicant she presented herself with a fatherless baby and the third marked the period of her change from being picturesquely sinful to become the village gossip of sin she was cited for bearing false witness against a neighbor because she had abused her position as midwife to declare that all the signs on the baby of a loose village wench pointed to a respectable married leader of the church at his father but with the years of graying hairs sister phibby had become more circumspect and for a few venial lapses such as when she got drunk over the washing of a dead body and backslid on such occasions into lecherous language her manner of self expression was limited to discret gossip her aberrations did not create any real difference in her life for in those negro communities it was a commonplace for people to fall from grace and return again and again as if their native philosophy was that in the enjoyment of life there must be constant sin and repentance

7289679 was a shade darker than bita his wife some shades lighter a pretty honey coloured woman
7289680 miss delminto was a pretty and popular light brown girl
7289681 the social life of the colony was rooted upon shade and colour prejudice during the epoch of slavery the lighter skinned offspring of white men and black women had privileges that the black slaves had not although the eurafricans were slaves the majority of them were attached to the masters households while the blacks worked in the fields many of the eurafrican children were sent abroad to be educated by their fathers and some in time came into possession of landed property and even became slave owners themselves when slavery was abolished in the british west indies the eurafricans by their education and experience were in a favourable position to take advantage of the great social change but as the eurafricans developed in wealth and power they also approximated the social standards and attitudes of the white planters with little sympathy for the freed blacks and their problems their struggles for social adjustment and so there had developed between europeans and eurafricans on one side a system of social discrimation against the expatriate africans
7289682 if there was anything that priscilla craig and her fellow workers in christ were agreed on in discussing the qualities of the natives
7289683 their faults and their virtues it was the lack of restraint among them where the law of the land was concerned they were quite docile in obedience but in the moral law generally they were so lax they did not seem to grasp the meaning of the high social significance of existence sex was approached to easily and for that reason some of the most promising young men and young women who had been chosen or had chosen the preaching and teaching professions often found themeselves halted and worthless in the midst of their career it wasnt because these people were oversexed but simply because they seemed to lack that check and control that was supposed to be distinguishing of humanity of a higher and more complex social order and that they were apparently incapable of comprehending the opprobium of breeding bastards in a christian community
7289684 that evening bita returned to jubilee and when she spied sister phibby with rosyanna at the kitchen window as the buggy drove up the gravelway she knew that the story of the tea meeting had already reached jubilee and was prepared for an ordeal mrs craig greeted her gravely and she presided over the dinner table like a piece of sculpture betraying no sign of the agitation burning within her
7289685 had assented to his proposal of marriage merely to fit into a plan something thrust upon her that she had not felt even a reaction to refuse because like her training it was designed to serve a purpose that was more than herself the crowning of her education it had never been lost upon her from the time the craigs adopted her after the rape that she was the subject of an experiment and as she grew in understanding she had voluntarily conceded herself as one does to a mesmerist
7289686 there was a block of ice she longed to be free from the irritation of his presence so that she could push the eventuality of their union far out of her mind and then play without effort at the make believe of being engaged but he was so inevitable always intrusive and entirely lacking in intuition she felt that if she had to bear always the constant contact she might just break out one day with something that would destroy irreparably the whole fabric of the plan that had been so carefully charted for her
7289687 for those small statues with importants points exaggerated and others minimized the word that came to her lips was grotesque she could find no significance in them so far were they removed from the classic greek and roman tradition these objects seemed mere caricatures of a poor and miserably fallen humanity abandoned of god but as she gazed fixedly at them they seemed to take on a forbidden actuality and potency as if they were immortal a state of being beyond grace and salvation all that those masks on the wall hideous things contributed to the purpose of life was an eternal obscene greening but gazing again at the masks they all seemed to be hideously greening and impelled to the wall by a magnetic power she attempted to touch one of them to test the reality of her eyes when the mocking thing suddenly detached itself and began dancing around her others followed the first and priscilla found herself sorrounded by a grinning dancing fury and suddenly she too was in motion and madly whirling round and round with the weird dancing masks
7289688 to enter into the simple life of the island negroes and proclaim significance and beauty in their transplanted folk tales and in the words and music of their native dialect songs he had found artistry were others saw nothing because he believed that wherever the imprints of nature and humanity were found there also were the seeds of creative life and that above the dreary levels of existence everywhere there were always the radiant the mysterious the wonderful the strange great moments whose magic may be caught by any clairvoyant mind and turned into magical form for the joy of man
7289689 in the system of modern education it grinds out certain fixed types on different grades to fit into a preconceived plan and there is no room in it for one who would like to think and to act independently all my relatives and friends had some better idea than myself of how i should live what purpose should i live for wanted to dispose of my life for some noble ideal of service a class a cause a loyalty they were horrified because i thought it was the best thing for a man to devote himself first to the understanding and adjusting of his own life to life

7289693 she priscilla could never understand a girl like bita really falling in love with a man like hopping dick and to account for it she had come to the conclusion that bita at bottom was a nymphomaniac the sounding and pronunciation of that word was stupendous to anty nommy and in spite of the sad occasion she was pleased to think that it meant that bita was a wonderful person so after relating the conversation to bita and trying to get her to see the matter from mrs craigs angle she ended by saying and she said dat she ben tinking dat youse a nymph fer manaxe and anty nommy was at a loss to understand why the phrase should have sent bita into such a fury

7289697 it was strange and she was aware of the strangeness that in that moment of extreme sorrow she should be seized by the powerful inevitable desire for love which would not be denied she was not oblivious of her fathers body in the back but her conscience fortified her with a conviction of the approval of his spirit he who had seemed to understand her all her life would understand now her spirit was finely balanced between the delicate sadness of death and the subdued joy of love and over all was the glorious sensation of life triumphant over death
7289698 i am totally engrossed in war nga the fictional heroine of the novel i have been writing on toilet paper for the last ten months or so
7289699 writing this novel has been a daily almost hourly assertion of my will to remain human and free despite de kenya african national union kanu official government programme of animal degradation of political prisoners
7289700 free thoughts on toilet paper i had deliberately given myself a difficult task i had resolve to use a language which did not have a modern novel a challenge to myself and a way of affirming my faith in the possibilities of the languages of all the different kenyan nationalities languages whose development as vehicles for the kenyan peoples anti imperialist struggles had been actively suppressed by the british colonial regime 1895 1963 and by the neocolonial regime of kenyatta and his comprador kanu cohorts i had also resolve not to make any concessions to the language i would not avoid any subject science technology philosophy religion music political economy provided it logically arose out of the development of the theme character plot story and world view further i would use any and everything i had ever learnt about the craft of fiction allegory parable satire narrative description reminiscence flash back interior monologue stream of consciousness dialogue drama provided it came naturally in the development of character theme and story but content not language and technique would determine the eventual form of the novel and the content the kenyan peoples struggles against the neo colonial form and stage of imperialism

7289705 first things first this feast is not a devils feast and it has not been organized by satan this feast has been arranged by the organization for modern theft and robbery in ilmorog to commemorate a visit by foreign guests from an organization for the thieves and robbers of the western world particularly from america england germany france italy sweden and japan called the international organization of thieves and robbers
7289706 for the kingdom of earthly wiles can be likened unto a ruler who foresaw that the day would come when he would be thrown out of a certain country by the masses and their guerrilla freedom fighters he was much troubled in his heart trying to determine ways of protecting all the property he had accumulated in that country and also ways of maintaining his rule over the natives by other means he asked himself what shall i do seeing that all these people over whom i have always lorded are now about to expel me from these plantations and factories that i have taken from them i can no longer cultivate the fields i can no longer work with my hands and if i wait until i am clubbed and gunned out of the country i will live forever in shame because of all the hair raising stories i have told them about the invincible might of my armoured cars and bombs and because i have always tried to show them that the white race can never be dominated by the black race
7289707 and it came to pass that as the ruler was about to return to his home abroad he again called together all his servants and gave them the key to the land telling them the patriotic guerrillas and the masses of this country will now be deceived because you are all black as they are and they will chant see now our black people have the key to our country see now our black people hold the sterring wheel what were we fighting for if not this let us now put down our arms and sing hymns of praise to our black lords
7289708 stepped forward and told his master you lord and master member of the white race i have discovered your tricks i have also discovered your real name imperialist thats your real name and you are a cruel master why because you reap where you have never sown you grab things over which you have never shed any sweat you have appointed yourself the distributor of things which you have never helped to produce why just because you are the owner of capital and so i went and buried your money in the ground to see if your money would yield anything without being fertilized by my sweat or that of any other man behold here is your 100 000 shillings exactly as you left it i now give you back your capital count it and check that not a single cent is missing the most remarkable thing was this my own sweat provided me with food to eat water to drink and a shelter in which to sleep if today i joined hands with all others who have opted to be masters over their own sweat there would be no limit to the wealth we could produce for our people and country
7289709 arrest him now before he spreads these poisonous thoughts to other workers and peasants and teaches them that the power of organized unity is stronger than all my bombs and armoured vehicles take away even the little that he has and divide it among yourselves for unto the man of property more will be given but from the poor man will be taken even the little that he has kept in reserve that is the most important of all my commandments
7289710 on their heads they wore hats like crowns each crown was decorated with seven metal objects shaped like horns which gleamed so brightly that they almost blinded the eyes all the crowns looked alike but the leaders was a little larger than the others the tips of the horns were twisted into the initial of the country that each delegate came from
7289711 the badges were made of metal and like neon advertisements they flashed on and off illuminating the words that were inscribed on them each badge wore one or two slogans like the following world banks world commercial banks worlds exploitation banks money swallowing insurance schemes all products fair and lovely to keep fools in the dependent chains of slavery slave for comfort deal with me and many others in similar vein

7289713 a national culture must reflect the entire national situation rooted as it is in the concrete experiences of the various nationalities that make up the kenyan nation modern kenyan national culture will then be a symphony played by a huge orchestra of all kenyan communities in harmony the symphony will be conducted in the all kenya national language swahili while the regional parts of the orchestra will be conducted in the languages of the various peasant communities

7289722 k meendeeri intends to fence off the farm with barbed wire just like the wire that was used to fence off detention camps during the state of emergency in colonial kenya he plans to pen the workers there like animals he will then fix electrically operated machines to their bodies for milking their sweat or the energy that produces sweat their blood and their brains the three commodities will then be exported to foreign countries to feed industries there to feed industries there for every gallon of sweat or blood or brains k meendeeri will get commission at a fixed rate
7289723 this means that the churches concluye el narrador the schools the poetry the songs the cinema the beer halls the clubs the newspapers will all act as brain washing poisons whose purpose will be to convince workers that in this world there is nothing as glorious as slavery to the k meendeeri class so that each worker will look forward to the day he dies when his body will become fertilizer to make the farm ever more productive the intellectual and spiritual and cultural brain washing poisons will make the workers believe literally that to obey the k meendeeri class is to obey god and that to anger or oppose their overlords is to anger and oppose god
7289724 have you already forgotten that this is the teaching of your own church that the eating of human flesh and the drinking of human blood is blessed on earth and in heaven the k meendeeri class is only acting out the central symbolism of the christian religion the k meendeeris are the true christian disciples

7289819 with all due respect a system that requires an insane person to first make a substantial showing of his own lack of mental capacity without the assistance of counsel or a mental health expert in order to obtain such assistance is by definition an insane system
7289820 he will become delusional and deny the apparent reality right in front of him
7289821 at least arguably suggest the petitioner lacks a rational understanding of the casual link between his role in his criminal offense and the reason he has been sentenced to death
7289822 federal judge chastising the texas courts orders a stay of execution
7289823 today the federal district court granted a stay of execution in the case of jeff wood to allow the court to consider compelling evidence that jeff wood is too mentally ill to be executed
7289824 held that the texas state courts have not carefully reviewed the question of woods competence and that a stay of execution is necessary to ensure that woods mental health issues are fully presented and considered by the courts
7289825 at reneaus trial the prosecution had argued that reneau was the person chiefly responsible for the crime and that woods role was secondary
7289826 a delusional system an inability to grasp the reality surrounding the issues specific to this case his role in it in the crime
7289827 if a person is only mentally ill and not incompetent the decisions are less clear and are up to individual judgments by the governor or the jury
7289828 mr wood suffers today from the same psychological and emotional impairments for which a jury found him incompetent to stand trial in 1997
7289829 he has never received psychiatric or mental health care for these impairments

7289879 that state with all its resources was built under np rule while sanctions were firmly in place
7289880 what we have after 15 years under anc rule without any sanctions is not what the np envisioned it is time for the np to return and introduce policies that passed the test under its rule for more than 40 years we are eager to unleash those policies to the benefit of all 47 million of us
7289881 service standards are collapsing due to the fact that people get appointed based on race rather than skill requirements and this the np will not tolerate as we aim to make south africa right
7289882 the shutting down of the party gave a chance to other parties to make huge mistakes and for us to regroup and develop a fresh young dynamic policy we have got a mandate from our supporters to put everything in place and the support base is now leading the whole agenda of the party in fact
7289883 we in the leadership are struggling to keep up with the supporters
7289884 people see us as the only party that really is for everybody zilles party we see as white english zumas is black we immediately attach the nature of the party to the person taking the lead so that is why we are concentrating on offering a diverse leadership and it is working
7289885 we are busy with a group of africans from the anc
7289886 yes indeed meetings at executive level have been held in the free state
7289887 these people came to us and offered to launch the np youth league so we know race is not a stumbling block
7289888 the np is a modern party we are not an open grave which has taken out all these fossils in the form of the old nat leaders we know we need fresh input we need the black diamonds who can definitely play a role were so excited on that point
7289889 black diamonds who have not voted before and who are sick and tired of race politics are starting to think for themselves
7289890 and unlike some other parties we dont want to use coloured people as window dressing we have absolutely all the colours and were not going to have to keep quotas as developing our representation must be a natural process
7289891 hope and pray like hell that people will vote for you

7289895 most of the big parties are not in touch with their voters anymore
7289896 this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so id describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us
7289897 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi before the first corner however im not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction as a result i could close the gap to robert kubica a little at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer having said that its good that the team scored a lot of points with lewiss second place and my fourth place
7289898 we saw another extremely solid team performance today the result of which was a very useful clutch of championship points but in truth we lost the chance of outright victory yesterday in qualifying in my view its pretty clear that if lewis had qualified with the same level of fuel as felipe hed probably have been able to control the race from the front but the nature of the circuit dictated that it was always going to be difficult for him to overtake today and that being the case we opted fairly early on to take the championship strategic option of settling for second place following on from his victory in hungary heikki also drove very strongly and helped bolster our points total in the constructors championship he responded well to the pressure applied by kimi and thoroughly deserved his fourth place
7289899 es hat spa gemacht aber es war auch hart es ist eine sch ne rennstrecke mein rennstart war nicht so gut ich stand auf der schmutzigen seite in kurve eins war ich am limit und nah an kimi r ikk nen dran ich konnte im ersten stint man meinen platz gegen jarno trulli verteidigen er hatte aber etwas mehr sprit an bord und konnte eine runde l nger drau en bleiben so hat er mich dann in den boxen berholt
7289900 wir haben keine fehler gemacht am gesamten wochenende nicht und konnten unsere leistung voll ausnutzen das ganze team kann stolz sein auf das was es erreicht hat hoffentlich k nnen wir bei den kommenden rennen wieder in den top 10 sein
7289901 das rennen war sch n abgesehen von der tatsache dass ich mit heidfeld kollidierte dadurch brach mein fl gel und ich musste 17 runden damit fahren dabei verlor ich 20 sekunden auf die gruppe in der ich fuhr
7289902 die folgenden beiden stints waren richtig gut ich hatte eine gute pace ich bin zufrieden mit dem ergebnis wir hatten auch die richtige strategie
7289903 das ist mein bestes ergebnis seit australien und besonders ab dem zweiten stint f hlte ich mich sehr wohl und war zufrieden mit dem auto ich konnte richtig angreifen nachdem mehr gummi auf der bahn war
7289904 die n chsten rennen gehe ich weiter schritt f r schritt an ich hoffe dass ich es in spa in die punkte schaffe
7289905 am ende kamen unsere beiden fahrer dort ins ziel wo sie auch gestartet waren auf den pl tzen sechs und zehn das ist ein gutes ergebnis da alle top teams bis auf ferrari beide autos ins ziel brachten vettel hatte einen guten start wenn man bedenkt dass er auf der schmutzigen seite stand er kollidierte aber leicht mit r ikk nen und hatte ein paar vibrationen danach im zweiten stint bekam er zudem graining
7289906 er fuhr ein gutes rennen und war am ganzen wochenende stark
7289907 wir haben gezeigt dass sich unsere leistungen von rennen zu rennen verbessern wir freuen uns daher auf spa und monza ich bin berzeigt dass diese beiden rennen speziell monza zu unserem paket passen werden f r toro rosso und red bull war dies ein sehr erfolgreiches wochenende
7289908 sebastian ihr seid momentan eine echte konstante in den wm punkten als sechster losgefahren als sechster angekommen wie gl cklich bist du mit diesem resultat
7289909 sehr gl cklich vielen dank f r das kompliment zun chst ich denke wir haben dieses wochenende einfach alles richtig gemacht und 100 prozent aus uns selbst rausgeholt die mannschaft hat gut funktioniert die pitstops waren perfekt ich habe das auto auf der strecke gehalten das war grundvoraussetzung aber es hat funktioniert drei punkte mit nach hause zu nehmen ist fantastisch das h tten wir uns nicht ertr umen lassen als wir am mittwochnachmittag hier aufgekreuzt sind
7289910 ihr seid derzeit sogar schneller als red bull racing mit dem gleichen auto was macht euer team so stark
7289911 zun chst einmal muss man sagen dass bei red bull racing dieses wochenende nicht alles gestimmt hat sie haben am freitag etwas probiert was nicht so hingehauen hat und wenn man sich dann ein bisschen verl uft und ein bisschen den weg verliert nicht ruhig genug bleibt was sehr leicht passieren kann dann gehen einem ruck zuck f nf bis acht zehntel verloren
7289912 ich bin nat rlich sehr stolz auf das was wir dieses wochenende geleistet haben
7289913 die dann am samstagvormittag zu finden ist sehr schwierig denn da bleibt nicht viel zeit und im qualifying lag das mittelfeld sehr eng beisammen da sieht man dann gleich alt aus und steht am ende der schlange ich bin nat rlich sehr stolz auf das was wir dieses wochenende geleistet haben und es muss das ziel sein f r die n chsten rennen vor red bull racing zu sein
7289914 wie viel spa hattest du bei diesem premierenrennen auf diesem neuen kurs
7289915 sehr viel spa der gestrige tag war sehr gut f r uns ich h tte nicht gedacht dass wir so weit nach vorne fahren k nnen wenn die chance da ist muss man sie nutzen und das haben wir gemacht das heutige rennen war hei die temperaturen im auto waren sehr hoch das war sehr anstrengend es gab vielleicht nicht so viele berholman ver aber auf der strecke zu bleiben keine fehler zu machen und immer den anderen unter druck zu setzen das ist schwer genug es hat einfach alles gestimmt
7289916 robert kubica hatte probleme mit einer plastikt te die sich bei ihm verfangen hat hattest du selbst auch angst dass du dir etwas einfangen k nntest was da herumschwirrt
7289917 ja ich habe versucht dem ganzen auszuweichen denn es kann passieren dass es am fl gel h ngen bleibt oder aber auch in den seitenkasten oder in der airbox dann ist es bl d denn dann geht die temperatur hoch es waren leider sehr viel schmutz und papiert ten plastikt ten dosen alles war auf der strecke unterwegs
7289918 die strecke die man hier geschaffen hat ist sehr gut sehr herausfordernd
7289919 welche eindr cke nimmst du vom hafenkurs hier mit nach hause nico rosberg hat gesagt es k nnten noch ein paar boote mehr da sein
7289920 das ist mir eigentlich ziemlich egal denn ich bin kein bootsfreak ich war gestern zum ersten mal segeln das war sehr spannend ich habe den motor vermisst aber es war sehr interessant die strecke die man hier geschaffen hat ist sehr gut sehr herausfordernd es ist alles drin es sind zwar meist langsame kurven aber es ist sehr schwierig die richtige linie zu finden und man kann sehr viel zeit finden oder auch verlieren das geht ganz schnell es ist also schwer genug
7289921 ich glaube auch vom sicherheitsstandard her ist es eine ganz neue dimension man kann stolz sein man hat viel f r das n chste jahr gelernt die stadt ist ja nichts neues denn valencia gibt es ja schon l nger der fu ballklub ist bekannt jetzt auch die formel 1 ich freue mich darauf wieder hierher zu kommen
7289922 viele deutsche fans werden in zwei wochen nach spa francorchamps pilgern was kannst du denen dort bieten
7289923 spa ist eigentlich eine strecke die uns sehr gut liegen sollte berrascht dass es an diesem wochenende so gut geklappt hat war ich aus dem grund weil langsame kurven und langsame strecken uns eigentlich weniger liegen sollten aber es ist gut zu zeigen dass es auch hier geht deswegen macht mich das sehr selbstsicher und zuversichtlich f r die restlichen rennen wenn dann wieder ein paar schnellere kurven drin sind in spa sollte es dann auch hnlich gut funktionieren aber man muss die f e auf dem boden lassen alles was f r uns in die n he oder sogar in die top 10 geht ist f r uns fantastisch

7289985 of course the secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told but the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the president for his notions grow like a tropical forest so in case you dont know id better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now originally of course we met in a cell underground just as your branch does then sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant he said that if you didnt seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out well he is the only man on earth i know but sometimes i really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age for now we flaunt ourselves before the public we have our breakfast on a balcony on a balcony if you please overlooking leicester square
