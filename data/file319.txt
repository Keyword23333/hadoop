3190000 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3190001 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3190002 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3190003 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3190004 change we can believe in barack obamas plan to renew americas promise
3190005 we are proud to have published two best selling books by barack obama and are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue to work with his campaign on such an important and inspiring book at this critical moment in our country
3190006 ralph nader is not a protest candidate he is not for sale and neither is my vote
3190007 i am not voting for a third party or a third person nor is my vote a protest vote and obama has the support of democrats not necessarily liberals liberals like myself are backing ralph nader
3190008 third or fourth party presidential candidates could garner enough votes in november to make a difference in some of the hotly contested swing states
3190009 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
3190010 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
3190011 a few things we wont tolerate personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3190012 personal attacks obscenity vulgarity profanity including expletives and letters followed by dashes commercial promotion impersonations incoherence and shouting
3190013 campaigns and parties often use dirty tricks to suppress the vote
3190014 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3190015 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3190016 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3190017 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3190018 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3190019 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3190020 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3190021 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3190022 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3190023 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3190024 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3190025 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3190026 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3190027 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3190028 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3190029 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3190030 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3190031 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3190032 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3190033 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3190034 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3190035 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3190036 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3190037 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3190038 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3190039 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3190040 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3190041 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3190042 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3190043 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3190044 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3190045 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3190046 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3190047 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3190048 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3190049 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3190050 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3190051 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3190052 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3190053 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3190054 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3190055 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
3190056 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3190057 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3190058 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
3190059 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3190060 exista si o evaluare facuta daca toata lumea ar avea o toneta ar fi 200 de tonete fata de 860 cite sint acum
3190061 mai avem in jur de 50 60 de tonete cu legume si fructe ii vom trimite spre piete aceste situatii vor fi analizate in comisiile consiliului local exista si trei amplasamente pe care s ar putea inlocui tonetele actuale cu module
3190062 la ce suma a cistigat cred ca nu a spus nimanui nimic
3190063 datele despre cistigator vor fi tinute secrete de reprezentantii loteriei in cazul in care acesta nu va dori sa si faca publica identitatea
3190064 stiu doar ca biletul de 13 3 milioane de lei a fost jucat la o agentie din iasi
3190065 am completat multe bilete unele chiar cistigatoare majoritatea la categoriile ii si iii
3190066 cineva care a prins categoria a ii a la 6 din 49 adjudecindu si 20 000 de lei in martie mi a trimis un buchet de flori
3190067 in 87 cind lucram la braila am ales pentru cineva trei numere care i au adus un cistig de 17 500 de lei la categoria i a unei trageri speciale in mod normal ar fi cistigat 70 000 de lei dar jocul avea un sistem care permitea si celor mai saraci sa joace adica se putea plati un sfert din pretul biletului in acest caz valoarea cistigului reducindu se la o patrime la categoria i cistigai daca aveai primele trei numere extrase la a doua daca aveai trei numere din primele patru extrase iar la a treia daca te incadrai in primele cinci numere iesite
3190068 a fost o intilnire a asociatiei euroregiunii siret prut nistru din aceasta asociatie fac parte 18 raioane din republica moldova si doua judete din romania vaslui si iasi
3190069 solicit despagubiri morale pentru prejudiciul moral si de imagine suferit in cuantum simbolic de un leu si obligarea piritei la afisarea publica a hotaririi judecatoresti ce se va pronunta in scopul reabilitarii mele profesionale si morale in mediul universitar
3190070 pina la data emiterii hotaririi in discutie nici un membru al consiliului facultatii nu mi a adus la cunostiinta existenta vreunei plingeri referitoare la activitatea mea didactica prin aceasta hotarire s a procedat la creditarea in absolut fara verificare a studentilor nemultumiti de carentele sistemului de invatamint masura contestata prin prezenta actiune a venit sa zdruncine cariera mea si m a surprins prin negalitatea ei
3190071 imprejurarea ca hotarirea contestata a ajuns la cunostinta reclamantei fara a fi comunicata oficial nu semnifica ca ea a fost validata de conducerea institutiei noastre reclamanta a inteles sa dea curs acestei hotariri fara a fi intr un fel obligata sa faca asta nu a fost data afara de la ore si nu i a fost interzis accesul la cursuri cum hotarirea nu a fost confirmata de conducerea universitatii ea nu a produs efecte
3190072 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3190073 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3190074 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3190075 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3190076 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3190077 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3190078 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3190079 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3190080 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3190081 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3190082 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3190083 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3190084 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3190085 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3190086 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3190087 you dont have to attack the united states to put us on our back you just cut 30 percent of the oil
3190088 global warming is on page two for me page one is foreign oil
3190089 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3190090 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3190091 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3190092 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
3190093 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
3190094 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
3190095 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
3190096 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
3190097 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
3190098 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
3190099 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
3190100 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
3190101 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
3190102 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
3190103 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
3190104 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
3190105 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
3190106 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
3190107 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3190108 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3190109 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3190110 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3190111 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3190112 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3190113 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3190114 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3190115 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3190116 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3190117 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3190118 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3190119 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3190120 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3190121 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3190122 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3190123 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3190124 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3190125 just so you all know we did set a record
3190126 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3190127 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3190128 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3190129 our australian and asian businesses have performed well during the period in particular our outdoor business being the standout performer
3190130 significant progress is being made in our online business we have a number of exciting organic online opportunities particularly in our regional markets
3190131 we are also announcing today the acquisition of media1 new zealands third largest outdoor advertising business cementing our position as the largest outdoor operator in that market
3190132 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3190133 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3190134 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3190135 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3190136 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3190137 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3190138 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3190139 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3190140 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3190141 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3190142 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3190143 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3190144 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3190145 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
3190146 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
3190147 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
3190148 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3190149 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3190150 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3190151 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3190152 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3190153 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3190154 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3190155 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3190156 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3190157 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3190158 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3190159 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3190160 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3190161 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3190162 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3190163 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3190164 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3190165 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3190166 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3190167 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3190168 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3190169 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3190170 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3190171 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3190172 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3190173 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3190174 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3190175 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3190176 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3190177 lista celor 61 de alimente inscrise la bruxelles este inca din 2003 in 2006 s a modificat regulamentul aplicat de ue produselor traditionale iar in 2007 odata cu aderarea romaniei la uniunea europeana s a modificat si legislatia nationala prin hg 828 2007 astfel ca ue a dat termen ca pina la sfirsitul anului 2007 toate procesele legate de produsul traditional sa fie in conformitate cu conditiile impuse de ue

3190182 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3190183 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3190184 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3190185 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
3190186 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
3190187 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
3190188 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
3190189 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
3190190 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
3190191 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3190192 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3190193 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3190194 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3190195 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3190196 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3190197 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
3190198 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
3190199 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3190200 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3190201 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3190202 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3190203 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3190204 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3190205 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3190206 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3190207 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3190208 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3190209 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3190210 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3190211 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3190212 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3190213 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3190214 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3190215 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3190216 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3190217 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3190218 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3190219 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3190220 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3190221 avind in vedere numarul deosebit de mare de reclamatii privind serviciile oferite de sc rcs amp rds sa adica 205 sesizari in perioada august 2007 pina in prezent si constatind in nenumarate rinduri reaua credinta si sfidarea din partea operatorului economic la adresa consumatorilor precum si lipsa eforturilor de corijare a conduitei in relatia cu acestia am propus aplicarea sanctiunii de inchidere a unitatii conform og 21 1992 privind protectia consumatorilor republicata cu modificarile si completarile ulterioare
3190222 ne aflam intr o situatie fara iesire si este impardonabil ceea ce se intimpla pe linga faptul ca este un puhoi de reclamatii la adresa rcs amp rds nici sanctiunile contraventionale nu au nici un efect intrucit le contesta in instanta din acest motiv vreau sa consult iesenii sa le cunosc parerea in legatura cu inchiderea punctului de lucru din iasi
3190223 nu vreau sa inchid firma peste noapte la iasi rcs are o cota de piata de peste 60 daca primesc avizul favorabil din partea consumatorilor atunci o sa imaginez o solutie in care abonatii vor avea timp doua sau trei saptamini pentru a se transfera la un alt operator de profil care activeaza in iasi fiecare consumator isi va alege societatea pe care o considera mai potrivita
3190224 totul se va regla in timp o sa prelungim perioada daca este nevoie vreau intii de toate sa vad daca oamenii ar fi dispusi sa se mute la un alt operator
3190225 sc rcs amp rds sa a formulat in instanta 19 plingeri contraventionale impotriva proceselor verbale de contraventie dintre acestea au fost finalizate definitiv si irevocabil 15 dosare adica 12 favorabil prin respingerea plingerii operatorului unul prin diminuarea amenzii de la 4 000 lei la 2 000 lei unul de anulare a procesului verbal si unul de transformare a amenzii in avertisment restul se afla in continuare pe rolul instantelor de judecata si nu exista o decizie definitiva si irevocabila in acest sens

3190230 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3190231 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3190232 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3190233 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

3190237 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3190238 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3190239 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3190240 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3190241 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3190242 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3190243 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3190261 shame on the state for not stepping up to the plate
3190262 i think the state needs to be more involved via the state codes theyre supposed to be more involved with the mentally ill people than the county
3190263 we cant bury our heads in the sand enough is enough
3190264 its a pretty big difference you can walk down stairs with a lot more confidence you can go foot over foot rather than just falling to the next step i walked through a field earlier this morning and its a lot easier to walk through taller grass and uneven terrain you dont have to think about it as much youre able to walk rather than thinking about what your next step is going to be or looking ahead at obstacles and stuff

3190270 i heard a big splash in the creek and craig was lying in the water
3190271 and he said grab amanda because one of the trees knocked her head and knocked her in the water
3190272 and he started to go under the water and then i held him on my lap

3190274 the coalition knows full well that over two years of discussion debate and consultation on pacific island seasonal workers has already been undertaken
3190275 since 2005 weve been completely transparent about the need to bring workers in from pacific island nations and the absolute imperative of ensuring that the terms and conditions of employment be fundamentally premised on mutual benefit
3190276 in short the government the australian workers union and the community have all moved on its a shame some in the coalition have not
3190277 we have confidence in the continued growth in china and longer term strength of the resources and energy cycle

3190289 the principle behind larrabee is that we can get more efficiency by adding cores than by trying to squeeze more out of a single core

3190315 en bolivia sali derrotado el imperialismo que quer a debilitar y acabar con el gobierno de evo morales y triunf una nueva forma de hacer democracia participativa revolucionaria
3190316 sin embargo la ultraderecha que gobern el continente durante d cadas con el apoyo de estados unidos y en base a dictaduras dice que los dictadores somos nosotros aun cuando somos nosotros mismos quienes convocamos este tipo de consultas
3190317 las dictaduras y democracias anteriores nunca se atrevieron a consultar al pueblo ahora s lo hacemos

3190319 el conjunto de leyes toca una serie de puntos lgidos que en el referendo del 2 de diciembre quedaron congelados durante todo este per odo constitucional de tal manera que ahondar todo lo que tiene que ver con la propiedad privada en el sentido de que el gobierno viene a ser el nico rector y el que maneja todas estas cosas
3190320 que viene a ser el nico rector de todas las cosas
3190321 en menos de 48 horas que leyes que nadie hab a visto le dan bendici n y la unci n de su legalidad
3190322 que la legalidad de unas leyes que tocan puntos que tienen que ver con la constituci n lo ponen m s bien como en duda leyes que no han sido consultadas con los diversos sectores y fueron hechas por la gente del gobierno
3190323 pienso que el gobierno de rosales mantiene una actitud de lenidad con los paramilitares lo que al parecer forma parte de su planteamiento separatista
3190324 estoy seguro de que el gobierno nacional est plenamente dispuesto a enfrentar el secuestro en todos sus frentes
3190325 lo m s importante de todo esto es que vamos a poder gozar de un nuevo sistema telef rico donde incluso mejoraremos y duplicaremos la capacidad operativa para atender m s turistas y no mil por d a como lo hemos estado haciendo en los ltimos tiempos

3190328 identity card that defiantly spoke in the first person of an arab man giving his identity number a common practice among palestinians when dealing with israeli authorities and arab governments and vowing to return to his land
3190329 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
3190330 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
3190331 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
3190332 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
3190333 hes not going to catch him hes not going to catch him
3190334 at this stage weve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating that theyre needing to seek protection in australia
3190335 any large event in australia is going to absolutely have in amongst the people who come here those who are seeking protection
3190336 its a very clear and known means for people to flee persecution in their country of origin
3190337 were seeing people from cameroon were seeing people from burundi were seeing people from kenya were seeing people from pakistan
3190338 obviously were aware that there are pilgrims out there who have been given three month visas and so it might well be at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection
3190339 we remain confident about the continuing growth story our ability to enhance shareholder value and importantly the positive life changing benefits we deliver to recipients
3190340 in financial year 2009 cochlear again anticipates double digit core earnings growth with a bias towards profit delivery in the second half
3190341 we expect the markets for worley parsons services will remain strong
3190342 our key markets and sectors continue to experience positive conditions and we are well positioned to respond to these opportunities
3190343 subject to conditions remaining favourable we expect to achieve increased earnings in 2009
3190344 positive trading conditions across the group continue and demand for our services remains high
3190345 this is especially so in the context of the strong appreciation of the australian dollar in the year
3190346 there has been a significant increase in interest in renewable energy including solar wind biomass and hydroelectric on a global basis
3190347 we expect continued strong demand for renewable energy gas turbine projects nuclear services and front end engineering for clean coal projects
3190348 the full extent of the current economic conditions on project development in the sector in 2009 is unknown but a significant number of projects have been awarded and worleyparsons growing geographic footprint and capability in the new resource regions should provide continued growth opportunities
3190349 the company does not expect the potential sale of these investments to contribute materially to future earnings
3190350 am avut o noua intilnire cu presedintele clubului care mi a explicat ca din cauza conjuncturii nefavorabile nu poate face nimic din pacate astept de prea mult timp am o oferta de la petrila pe care nu pot s o ignor cita vreme ma gindesc si la familia mea imi pare rau dar daca nu se mai poate la iasi voi pleca

3190362 the truth is most people on the dpb are not there for very long
3190363 you are continuing to build their business if you do that versus building your own
3190364 respect national sovereignty if its convenient and dont let anyone conquer smaller nations if you can stop them at minimal cost
3190365 truth is not what happened truth is what we tell people

3190368 if you were to be the president what first thing you would do
3190369 id give food and houses to all the homeless people
3190370 you dont have to wait until youre president to do that you can come over to my house and mow pull weeds and sweep my yard and ill pay you 50 then ill take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out and you can give him the 50 to use toward food or a new house
3190371 why doesnt the homeless guy come over and do the work and you can just pay him the 50
3190372 pffs gain valuable experience and development which they can use later whether this be on farms in helping their neighbours and community or with the cfa

3190392 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question
3190393 i think that everybody felt like it was a breakout year for him
3190394 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3190395 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between and distant observations of impacts on species
3190396 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3190397 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3190398 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3190399 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3190400 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3190401 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3190402 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3190403 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3190404 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3190405 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3190406 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3190407 we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
3190408 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally we urge you to carefully consider the existing precedent before making your determination
3190409 for consumers the interference will be extensive widespread and unpredictable significantly degrading their service
3190410 in essence theyre gaming the system to make rules so that a new broadband competitor doesnt appear
3190411 any new entrant especially one that appeals to consumers because the price is disruptive is something they want to kill or delay
3190412 to have any relevance they have to stick to this

3190415 i will say i dont want this to linger too much longer i should make my final decision pretty soon whatever that is i want to make sure its 100 per cent sure
3190416 when i talked to francois in june we both understood that the team was going to go forward regardless of what my decision was going to be and that enabled me to take as much time as i could
3190417 the sports hernia could happen to anybody at any age
3190418 it just happened but after the surgery i felt good i was prepared it was a long rehab rehabbing for three months wasnt a lot of fun so it didnt make last season very exciting for me right around a couple of weeks before playoff time i really started to get my legs back and feeling like i was playing back to my old self so that hasnt really weighed on anything

3190429 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed

3190431 recent storms have caused significant damage in many communities across new hampshire which is why we are asking fema to begin assessments to determine eligibility for federal assistance

3190558 kuselan has a story which is not all that attractive to the fans here who may not understand the tamil dialogues that is the reason why kuselan is getting such meagre collections the film does not have a repeat value

3190657 during adolescence about 18 percent to 20 percent of adolescents in the general population have the condition however in the study salt sensitivity was present in 37 percent of all low birth weight lbw and in 47 percent of the children who were small for gestational age sga
3190658 these children should be followed for signs of reduced renal function and also for an elevated blood pressure
3190659 theres nearly a 50 percent chance of favorably affecting blood pressure by simply reducing salt intake in children born sga and nearly a 40 percent chance for those born with lbw these individuals can be determined very easily if their family physician just gets data on their births
3190660 this is telling you that being a runner being active is going to reduce your disability and its going to increase your survival
3190661 late in life you still see the benefit of vigorous activity
3190662 illness would be compressed between later age of onset and age of death and that paradigm was controversial because it went against conventional wisdom and had no proof
3190663 running delayed the onset of disability by an average of 16 years and that is largely a conservative number because the control group was pretty darn healthy
3190664 i always thought that the two curves would start to parallel each other and that eventually aging would overpower exercise
3190665 i think that will happen but we cant find even a little twitch toward that gap narrowing in the present time
3190666 vigorous activity has a really dramatic impact but we cant ignore that there are also helpful benefits to people who are active at all levels meaning those people who are just out walking
3190667 its so important to be physically active your whole life not just in your 20s or 40s but forever
3190668 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3190669 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important that visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
3190670 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
3190671 these data show that a considerable proportion of overweight and obese u s adults are metabolically healthy whereas a considerable proportion of normal weight adults express a clustering of cardiometabolic abnormalities
3190672 further studies into the behavioral hormonal or biochemical and genetic mechanisms underlying these differential metabolic responses to body size are needed and will likely further the identification of possible obesity intervention targets and improve cardiovascular disease screening tools
3190673 both reports emphasize the benign nature of fat accumulation outside the abdomen
3190674 in both studies the detrimental effect of visceral fat accumulation and its surrogate waist circumference were clearly demonstrated confirming older studies showing that waist circumference is a risk factor even in normal weight individuals
3190675 almost all of us gastroenterologists and internists have become complacent about the use of these medications
3190676 this makes us all take a step back and look at all the patients we have on these medications and ask whether they require still being on this medication at this dosage at this frequency can we make some alterations in their dosing regimen can we switch them do they need to be on anything at all at this point
3190677 the other thing is that patients have to be made aware that if they are taking these medications ppis and they drink or smoke or take drugs like prednisone they dont do well orthopedically
3190678 from this newest article the comfortable zone looks like a length of time longer than the other studies seven years which is a nice amount of time thats enough time for any type of peptic ulcer disease to improve
3190679 some people think if i take ppis i can eat garbage all day long
3190680 we need to tighten up on those patients these medications are not without any kind of risk
3190681 i mean you must be here with alot of girls that will be 136 dollars and 45 cents would you like to apply for a ralphs card today and save 13 dollars on your order
3190682 it is with great sorrow that i learned of the death of master corporal erin doyle who was killed late yesterday in afghanistan our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends during this very emotional time i would also like to wish a quick recovery to a second canadian soldier injured in the same incident the two soldiers were bravely protecting their combat outpost in the panjwayi district of afghanistan when they came under attack by insurgents with rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire the vital contribution of the canadian forces to the united nations mandated nato led mission are making a difference in afghanistan master corporal doyle gave his life in support of our efforts to bring security to a country that has seen decades of war his sacrifice will not be forgotten and this event will not deter us from continuing to help afghans rebuild their country master corporal doyle was a true professional and dedicated canadian soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice in afghanistan he will be remembered with respect and gratitude

3190697 when you have a guy who can pressure the defense in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3190698 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3190699 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3190700 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3190701 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3190702 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3190703 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3190704 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3190705 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3190706 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3190707 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3190708 one must not hurry on such serious issues as serious mistakes can be made that have to be paid for a long time afterwards
3190709 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
3190710 i was impressed simply by the fact he was a quick study
3190711 he was able to step out there and step in the huddle spew the verbiage out get people lined up and actually get the ball around
3190712 any time you put on shoulder pads and helmets for the first day its always tough
3190713 i havent had a chance to put this stuff on since november when i got hurt so its good to be out here and good to be part of an organization like this
3190714 hes a very smart quarterback and hes got a strong arm
3190715 he understands we have an established starter here and hes just happy to do what we ask him to do

3190740 with panama with its dollarized economy sophisticated financial sector and years of solid economic growth is not used to dealing with the macroeconomic instability and inflationary woes typical of other latin american countries in the past but inflation in panama as in the rest of the region has picked up sharply since 2007 and is now at a 28 year high and this is having both social and political repercussions
3190741 the torrijos administration is struggling to formulate effective policies to confront high inflation as well as an increase in incidences of violent crime
3190742 although in the past mr torrijos has used his political acumen and a calculated willingness to compromise on unpopular measures to win support at this late stage in his term his touch seems less sure and the public less willing to be swayed most recently the president also has faced growing criticism for his failure to deliver on a much vaunted comprehensive solution to the capitals ailing public transportation system the increasing use of subsidies to tackle rising food costs during a pre election period and plans to restructure the security services

3190773 its kind of eerie how much information is available about you on a social network
3190774 and how many conclusions tentative or otherwise can be made so handily fairly or unfairly based on that information
3190775 ive seen a lot of quiet passive aggressive resentments and rumors that come from people just knowing that much about your business
3190776 if youre updating people like im at a barbecue at my colleagues house someone you work with might ask why am
3190777 could not take a chance to put their information on someone elses cloud

3190783 during the second quarter we almost doubled our revenues year on year and opened 67 of the 200 new hotels targeted for 2008
3190784 although accelerating our hotel conversion rate during the earlier part of the year resulted in higher pre opening expenses as well as a higher proportion of new hotels in our overall hotel mix we believe that even though this temporarily caused a negative impact on margins it is an important step to take to maintain our leading position in china and position us for future growth and profitability
3190785 the extent of the impact fuel prices are having on our business was underlined when we announced a loss of hkd663 million in our interim results last week we have to maximize our earnings during this difficult period which is why are moving our capacity however while we are reducing services on some routes we will continue to maintain the integrity of our network reshaping it where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money

3190876 older people have more limited access to psychological therapies than younger people
3190877 fewer than 10 of older people with clinical depression are referred to specialist mental health services compared with about 50 of younger adults with mental and emotional problems
3190878 negative attitudes about mental health problems make it very difficult for older people to talk about their feelings or to ask for help
3190879 it is scandalous that hundreds of thousands of older people may be denied treatment because depression is wrongly seen as a natural part of getting older

3191099 hasta medio siglo despu s de la muerte de cop rnico no ocurrieron cambios potencialmente revolucionarios en los datos disponibles a los astr nomos
3191100 cop rnico nos dice alexandre koyr no es un especialista estrecho un astr nomo t cnico sino un hombre profundamente imbuido de la rica y completa cultura de su poca artista sabio erudito hombre de acci n un humanista en el mejor sentido del t rmino

3191105 de una gran revoluci n que cambi todo el genio de europa se hizo conocer y se anunci en cop rnico
3191106 destrucci n del sistema de ptolomeo era un preliminar indispensable
3191107 esta revoluci n deb a preceder a todas las otras
3191108 bacon propon a un m todo demasiado perfecto para ser el autor de una revoluci n descartes hab a de lograrlo mejor 13 turgot se ala que en la historia del pensamiento cient fico philosophie
3191109 gran descartes si no os ha sido dado el hallar siempre la verdad al menos hab is destruido la tiran a del error
3191110 el famoso libro de los principios matem ticos de la filosof a natural ha constituido la poca de una gran revoluci n en la f sica
3191111 newton derroc y cambi todas las ideas arist teles y descartes compart an a n el imperio ellos eran los preceptores de europa el fil sofo ingl s destruy casi todas sus ense anzas y propuso una nueva filosof a esta filosof a ha operado una revoluci n
3191112 las rutas que acaban de ser abiertas por el c lculo de newton y leibniz constitu an la poca de una revoluci n casi total acaecida en la geometr a
3191113 las ciencias acaban de nacer nos hemos colocado en la v a correcta hace apenas un siglo
3191114 se ver a inclusive a nuevas ciencias salir de la nada y quiz s se dejar an ir bastante lejos las esperanzas para el porvenir
3191115 entre m s nos prometemos que ser dichoso m s estamos obligados a observar el estado presente de las ciencias como el de la cuna al menos el de la f sica
3191116 setenta a os sin invasiones sin rapi as sin destrucciones sin guerras civiles sin quemas en la hoguera sin trastornos interiores se podr an imaginar condiciones m s favorables para el trabajo fecundo
3191117 el progreso hist rico de las condiciones de afirmaci n de la verdad
3191118 todos los grandes ge metras entraron con ardor en las rutas que acababan de ser abiertas a pasos de gigantes el infinito elev todo a una sublimidad y al mismo tiempo elev todo a una facilidad que no se hubiera osado anteriormente concebir su esperanza
3191119 la noci n de revoluci n cient fica ha entrado en el vocabulario durante el per odo de agitaci n social que precedi a la revoluci n francesa
3191120 como el nombre de un concepto aceptado para caracterizar al cambio cient fico
3191121 muy alejado de un cartesianismo de identificaci n estricta con los enfoques metaf sicos iniciales
3191122 se puede afirmar que el fil sofo de los principes y de la geometr a contribuy m s que ninguno a propagar la idea del progreso de las ciencias
3191123 no sabr amos despu s de todo a cu l creer pues no existe pr cticamente nada que no haya sido dicho por uno cuyo contrario no haya sido afirmado por otro y para nada servir a contar los votos para seguir la opini n que re na el mayor n mero de partidarios a n si todos estuvieran de acuerdo entre ellos su doctrina no bastar a en efecto dar amos la apariencia de no haber aprendido ciencias sino historia
3191124 que tal vez exista una cuesti n sobre la cual los sabios hubieran estado en desacuerdo las m s de las veces
3191125 es imposible adquirir un conocimiento perfecto porque nosotros no podemos salvo presunci n esperar de nosotros mismos m s que lo que los dem s han hecho
3191126 ella corrompe el buen sentido m s bien que aumentarlo
3191127 el encadenamiento de verdades y de objeciones en buena y debida forma 38 no es pues por una experiencia ntima que la raz n se define sino por sus obras la raz n es un encadenamiento de verdades por la fuerza de su necesidad l gica argumentationis in forma
3191128 la verdad est mucho m s extendida de lo que se piensa pero frecuentemente est disfrazada cuando no envuelta o incluso debilitada mutilada corrompida por adiciones que la estropean o la vuelven menos til haciendo sobresalir estos restos de verdad en los antiguos o para hablar m s generalmente en los anteriores se retirar a el oro del lodo el diamante de su mina y la luz de las tinieblas esto ser a en efecto perennis quaedam philosophia se puede incluso decir que se observar a cierto progreso en los conocimientos
3191129 es por tal raz n que las ilustres academias de nuestra poca han protestado fuertemente no querer ser ni aristot licos ni cartesianos ni epicureos ni sectarios de autor alguno
3191130 el orden cient fico perfecto es aquel donde las proposiciones son colocadas siguiendo sus demostraciones m s simples y de la manera como ellas nacen las unas de las otras aunque este orden no es conocido con anterioridad se descubre cada vez m s en la medida en que la ciencia se perfecciona se puede decir incluso que las ciencias se abrevian aument ndose lo que constituye una verdadera paradoja pues entre m s se descubren verdades y m s se est en estado de observar una serie reglada y formularse proposiciones siempre m s universales donde las otras no son sino ejemplos o corolarios de suerte que se lograr hacer que un gran volumen de los que nos han precedido se reducir con el tiempo a dos o tres tesis generales
3191131 el inventario general de todos los conocimientos que se encuentran ya entre los hombres
3191132 reci n han nacido se ha entrado en la v a correcta aproximadamente hace un siglo
3191133 el v nculo la conexi n de los m todos el encadenamiento de las diferentes teor as
3191134 qu de m s satisfactorio que recorrer esta cadena la cual de las proposiciones m s sublimes conduce a las proposiciones m s sublimes se puede decir que es la verdadera escala del entendimiento que ped a el canciller bacon para subir por grados a los conocimientos m s altos
3191135 existe en los trabajos del esp ritu humano una marcha progresiva para la cual la filosof a se ala las diversas pocas lo que le sirve para comparar o clasificar los siglos bajo la relaci n de progresos que le han impulsado a hacer a la raz n los historiadores de las ciencias dirigen de ordinario sus esfuerzos hacia la investigaci n de estas pocas y los fastos de diverso g nero de conocimientos ofrecen siempre ejemplos m s o menos notables
3191136 durante sus fastos esta progresi n lenta este acrecentamiento sucesivo que el observador reconoce en todas las ramas de los conocimientos humanos
3191137 cada conocimiento no se desarrolla sino hasta que un cierto n mero de conocimientos precedentes se han desarrollado y cuando su turno para emerger ha llegado
3191138 dar cuenta de sus progresos en todas las pocas haciendo conocer sobretodo los descubrimientos propios a cada una o aqu llos donde se presentan los primeros g rmenes
3191139 para no hablar m s que de las matem ticas mr descartes comenz donde los antiguos hab an terminado y empez por la soluci n de un problema en el cual pappus dice que todos se hab an detenido
3191140 en defecto de tal c lculo sobrevivi el del c lebre mr leibniz y este sabio ge metra comenz donde mr barrow y los otros hab an terminado
3191141 ya que la ciencia misma no tendr a dimensi n hist rica m s que en apariencia
3191142 no hay casi descubrimiento atribuido a los modernos que no haya sido no solamente conocido sino incluso apoyado por s lidos razonamientos de los antiguos
3191143 se necesitan gu as seguros y qu mejores gu as se puede sequir que aquellos que hemos visto llegar a la meta mucho tiempo antes que nosotros a la cual nosotros nos proponemos ir
3191144 recomendar menos prevenci n contra los antiguos que han formado a estos modernos que nosotros admiramos ciegamente como si ellos no brillaran por una luz tomada de aquellos ilustres maestros
3191145 la ciencia mec nica y f sica de la cual se enorgullecen con justo derecho los tiempos modernos surge de una serie de perfeccionamientos apenas sensibles de las doctrinas profesadas en el seno de las escuelas de la edad media las pretendidas revoluciones intelectuales no han sido las m s de las veces sino evoluciones lentas y largamente preparadas los as llamados renacimientos reac ciones frecuentemente injustas y est riles el respeto por la tradici n es una condici n esencial del progreso cient fico
3191146 la formaci n de toda teor a f sica ha procedido siempre mediante una serie de retoques que gradualmente ha conducido al sistema a estados m s acabados una teor a f sica no es en modo alguno el producto repentino de una creaci n ella es el resultado lento y progresivo de una evoluci n
3191147 a veces la evoluci n que debe conducir a la construcci n de un sistema te rico se condensa extremadamente y algunos a os bastan para conducir las hip tesis que deben llevar esta teor a del estado en que est n apenas esbozadas al estado en que est n acabadas
3191148 implica siempre una desvalorizaci n de la ciencia pues no trata sino de los fen menos apariencias con relaci n a aquella que trata o tratar a de lo real
3191149 adoptan sin embargo suposiciones que conducen a calcular correctamente a partir de los principios de la geometr a tanto el futuro como el pasado de los movimientos celestes
3191150 ha logrado ambos prop sitos magn ficamente las hip tesis no necesi tan ser verdaderas o incluso probables todo lo contrario si proporcionan un c lculo consistente con las observaciones eso tan s lo es suficiente
3191151 siempre he pensado que cop rnico mismo hablaba as de una forma hipot tica pues limit ndose a decir que la hip tesis de que la tierra se mueve y el sol es inm vil permite representar mejor todos los fen menos que si se aceptan las exc ntricas y los epiciclos lo cual ser a perfecto y sin causar ning n da o pero querer afirmar que el sol es positivamente el centro del mundo y que no gira sino en torno a s mismo sin desplazarse de oriente a occidente y que la tierra est situada en la tercera esfera celeste girando a una enorme velocidad entorno al sol eso ser a muy peligroso y no s lo porque irritar a a los fil sofos y te logos escol sticos sino sobre todo porque ello contra dir a la santa fe haciendo aparecer las proposiciones de las escrituras como falsas
3191152 las entidades matem ticas no tienen una esencia permanente en la naturaleza de las cosas ellas dependen de la noci n que las define por ello la misma cosa puede ser explicada en diferentes maneras
3191153 el objeto de la ciencia es salvar las apariencias por la reproducci n y anticipaci n de los hechos en el pensamiento
3191154 en la investigaci n de la naturaleza tratamos nicamente con el conocimiento sobre la conexi n entre las apariencias lo que nos representamos entre las apariencias existe tan solo en nuestro entendimiento y tiene para nosotros s lo el valor de memoria t cnica o f rmula cuya forma al ser arbitraria e irrelevante var a muy f cilmente con el punto de vista de la cultura
3191155 esta novedad de las doctrinas relativistas es una objeci n es un problema 86 e igualmente desde el punto de vista hist rico la aparici n de estas teor as revolucionarias es por lo menos
3191156 si existen teor as cuyos antecedentes no las explican tal es el caso de la teor a de la relatividad 87 se trata verdaderamente de avan zadas del esp ritu que no conocen precedentes estudi ndolas como una sucesi n en el desarrollo hist rico de las ciencias bachelard postula su discontinuidad

3191222 if you have price control what choice do you have you have the choice of cutting down production and thats when itll hurt the consumer the common person
3191223 if the prices of the raw materials for controlled drugs rises any further theres a chance that the production of such drugs will simply stop
3191224 i think its highly likely that after september therell be shortages of those drugs in india
3191225 s lo porque no oyes el sonido de la m quina de escribir no significa que no est escribiendo
3191226 i got pulled in by the rip tide wearing a very small g string and nothing else
3191227 you cannot breathe the air is thick and there is smog
3191228 it feels like you are at 3 000 metres because of the air
3191229 if someone asked me if id put on a rain jacket in beijing i would have laughed at them
3191230 thats something thats definitely there for me to see and get me motivated and more excited
3191231 i like to have little quotes and goals stuck up around the house as a personal reminder of what im working towards
3191232 i have them stuck up in the bedroom and in the study so i can see them every day when i look at them i can go ok thats what im working towards and ive got to keep working towards those things
3191233 my favorite quote is they never said it would be easy they just said it would be worth it they are just little reminders so that if you are hurting a bit that day you can pick yourself up
3191234 i feel like im getting motivated by people my age telling me how im motivating them
3191235 im inspired by all the people calling me and telling me their stories im getting pumped up about it
3191236 i was surprised at my reaction they gave me motivation and energy to do well this year they took winning in front of our home crowd away from us and we want our revenge
3191237 my love for the sport and my determination to achieve my objectives kept me going
3191238 15 year old member nick jonas was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes from the age of 13
3191239 also gender representation and presentation i started college as a gender and queer studies major but captured in a way that looks at the layers through which we reveal or transform ourselves
3191240 the book is a retrospective of my last five years as a photographer i had so much shit putting it together was a way to recenter myself many of the pictures feature well known club personalities but theres other things in there as well
3191241 i love shooting queer san francisco nightlife with all the messy interaction especially since so many of my friends are involved and i revel in messy interaction
3191242 but i also really take to fashion photography and life documentation anything that expands the boundaries of portraiture and shows some of the story underneath the project that meant the most to me was a chronicle of the lives of hiv patients that i did for an organization called positive care for its anniversary
3191243 as we go through our strategic planning and customer requests are we providing things at a fast enough pace
3191244 acquire vis vis develop will bring products to market faster
3191245 it will be interesting to see how much they consolidate into roseville
3191246 procurve needed a stronger wlan story than what theyve had in the past
3191247 the motorola oem arrangement was decent for them but they are not leaders in the wlan market
3191248 colubris does very well in hospitality and guest networking hot spots
3191249 it allows attackers to do anything malicious on any mobile device
3191250 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3191251 at least one from each major family in the series
3191252 there are six long months of work in this research
3191253 some will be against this and some will be for it
3191254 the man of god is called to be with christ
3191255 a style of computing where massively scalable it enabled capabilities are delivered as a service to external customers using internet technologies
3191256 as service provisions a critical aspect of cloud computing grow vendors must become or partner with service providers to deliver their technologies indirectly to users
3191257 user organizations will watch portfolios of owned technologies decline as service portfolios grow the key activity will be to determine which cloud services will be viable and when
3191258 we havent announced anything for this type of cheap mini notebook and were still taking this wait and see attitude
3191259 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3191260 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well
3191261 we believe the story line of ultra low cost notebooks will increasingly be sidelined as the notebook market continues to offer a better solution and experience at price points similar to what ultra low cost notebooks are hitting
3191262 do not be afraid you have done all this evil yet do not turn aside from following the
3191263 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
3191264 i can fulfill gods will through christs strength i can do whatever he commands indeed i can even be content in chains
3191265 o lord let that which seems naturally impossible to me become possible through your grace
3191266 in all conflicts let us remember that with god nothing is impossible and as we read and hear his promises let us turn them into prayers
3191267 when you are facing the impossible you can count on the god of the impossible
3191268 god encourages us to ask as freely for the impossible as for the possible since to him all difficulties are the same size less than himself
3191269 when once we see jesus he does the impossible thing as naturally as breathing
3191270 faith does the impossible because it brings god to undertake for us and nothing is impossible with god
3191271 the one who directed that stone in between goliaths eyes and split the red sea down the middle and leveled that wall around jericho and brought his son back from beyond takes delight in mixing up the odds as he alters the inevitable and bypasses the impossible
3191272 you cannot bring a burden too heavy for god to lift or a problem too hard for him to solve or a request too big for him to answer god does things no one else can do
3191273 when you are dealing with him who is omnipotent faithful and true the things that seem utterly impossible will be those most likely to happen
3191274 our faith is not really tested until god asks us to bear what seems unbearable do what seems unreasonable and expect what seems impossible
3191275 independent living does not mean that we want to do everything by ourselves do not need anybody or like to live in isolation independent living means that we demand the same choices and control in our every day lives that our non disabled brothers and sisters neighbors and friends take for granted we want to grow up in our families go to the neighborhood school use the same bus as our neighbors work in jobs that are in line with our education and interests and raise families of our own we are profoundly ordinary people sharing the same need to feel included recognized and loved

3191277 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3191278 they think they know whats right and everyone else is wrong on everything
3191279 we have two oilmen in the white house the logical follow up from that is 3 a gallon gasoline it is no accident it is a cause and effect a cause and effect
3191280 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
3191281 the bush plan is a hoax it will neither reduce gas prices nor increase energy independence it just gives millions more acres to the same companies that are sitting on nearly 68 million acres of public lands and coastal areas
3191282 sometimes when im walking down the street oh oh i hear a song and i just love the beat and i want to tell all my friends

3191299 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point
3191300 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day
3191301 we were about 75 per cent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes
3191302 whats so exciting about the evolution of their style is how they can be so fashion forward and take so many risks but in a way that keeps it very young and very fresh
3191303 youll never see him in ratty sneakers or torn jeans
3191304 his style is the most dark the most polished and he keeps itsuper tailored and very sleek
3191305 he keeps his style young and current by mixing in a lot of leather a lot of shine and tons of accessories
3191306 hes the most likely to wear a crazy color and to wear it first
3191307 you can see that his vibe is definitely more boyish and more comfortable than kevins his shirt and tie are looser
3191308 being able to bend light in unusual ways is important for applications that almost resemble magic

3191320 people will respond to demagoguery if they dont believe they have sufficient knowledge and sufficient confidence in their ability to weigh arguments and assess whats behind them
3191321 the danger is that we move increasingly toward being a society where the most important decisions are ultimately made by fewer and fewer people
3191322 is a game that can be played by anybody with a serious interest in discovery
3191323 its a kind of learning that occurs through interaction with health care professionals
3191324 we have in this country a major crisis of people listening to people they feel comfortable with rather than listening to a variety of groups and critically thinking through their messages
3191325 we dont have to send someone a check or take on additional debt we simply reduce whats called the carrying value of those assets on our books which has no effect on the companys annual budget
3191326 while there are daily stories painting doubt on the newspaper industrys future medianews groups leadership is not among those who share these doubts
3191327 proceeds from the sale were used to repay almost 25 of our outstanding bank debt
3191328 excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired
3191329 theyre basically big springs at the base of the rocket
3191330 the ares team is doing well enough on their margins for performance that im comfortable that theyll be able to absorb the mass impact that these things imply with no problem
3191331 its a safety issue if that one system goes down youre gone
3191332 the september 2014 date brings us much better in line with what we forecast today to be the available dollars between now and then
3191333 we are not just blindly cutting out redundancy or robustness in this design process
3191334 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3191335 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3191336 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3191337 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3191338 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3191339 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3191340 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3191341 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3191342 the group of eight highly industrialized states becomes again a club of leading market democracies
3191343 it is always in our interests to engage to listen to build alliances to understand what our interests are and to be fierce in protecting those interests
3191344 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3191345 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3191346 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3191347 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3191348 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3191349 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3191350 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3191351 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3191352 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3191353 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3191354 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3191355 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3191356 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3191357 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light save it for 2050
3191358 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3191359 couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution
3191360 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from specific decisions she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
3191361 her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3191362 clintons top advisers never agreed on the answer over the course of the campaign they split into competing factions that drifted in and out of clintons favor but always seemed to work at cross purposes and clinton herself could never quite decide who was right
3191363 we have no right to judge him or anyone else
3191364 i always thought john edwards was different from the typical politician
3191365 i really dont think he can get into politics again
3191366 i think something that happened two years ago should be a private matter between him and his wife
3191367 russia must reverse the course it appears to be on
3191368 if these reports are accurate these actions would be inconsistent with the assurances we received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in georgian breakaway region south ossetia that existed before the fighting began on august 6
3191369 these actions jeopardize russians relations with the united states and europe
3191370 there are no discussions about the u s getting involved militarily
3191371 every time that fourth hour comes on i can literally feel my body temperature rising
3191372 the way she always talks over poor hoda and the guests and is just constantly talking about herself
3191373 doctors would say that the extra money in the contract is allowing them to provide the level of care in the deprived areas that they could not before
3191374 another interpretation is that the poorer performing doctors were capable of doing what they are now doing and have been pushed into it by the incentive of money
3191375 we joke that theyre going to have like a yao ming of softball
3191376 there are so many girls who look up to us as athletes and want to be in our shoes and dream of one day playing in the olympics
3191377 we may get a couple of big games where we score seven or eight runs i just dont see that being the norm weve had closer games since 04 the rest of the world has gotten better
3191378 the 04 team knew what it was like to lose
3191379 ive seen a few meltdowns along the way he said
3191380 one of the strengths of the great competitors in the arena is that you never see that
3191381 the question will always be when the big game is there do we have the experience
3191382 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark with animals committing fellatio and girl on girl action its quite unpleasant
3191383 as soon as the film grosses 18 7 mil she will be released and given a peach smoothie
3191384 if you arent part of the solution youre part of the problem
3191385 and wal mart shoppers amp supporters are definitely part of the problem
3191386 if you arent part of the solution youre part of the problem
3191387 rulon did a lot of great things when he was wrestling but hes gone now and this is byers journey
3191388 im going to go out here and do nothing but what im good at
3191389 youll be sitting there talking to him and hell have his medals sitting out and youll realize hey thats bruce baumgartner he talks with me and tells me good stuff
3191390 he can pass on a lot of wisdom about what were doing
3191391 ive been looking at that ipod so much if i pass one of those kids in the village i might give them a nod but its like he gut wrenches to the right he lifts to the left he does this on his feet
3191392 ill go through the whole breakdown i have the plan i just want to see it happen
3191393 we should start 2009 by calling a referendum on whether to approve the states new constitution policy
3191394 if we cant reach substantive agreements then we must address all those issues which divide us to a referendum issues like reelection the compatibility of autonomous governments land issues
3191395 this has been a defining moment in russias relations with the rest of world
3191396 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3191397 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3191398 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3191399 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3191400 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3191401 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3191402 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it
3191403 the russians are staying near gori they did not enter the city itself
3191404 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3191409 the olympic opening ceremony captivated the american public in unprecedented numbers for a non u s olympics
3191410 it was a magical and memorable spectacle and a great way to start the beijing olympics
3191411 i pointed out that both guys had won the championship and what they were willing to endure friedgen said
3191412 the intensity and wills of both guys is what i really wanted to show them this is what it takes to be champion
3191413 kids will listen to that you can tell them that but sometimes when you show them the video it sinks in a little bit friedgen said
3191414 of course a fight broke out and one guy thought he was ali
3191415 its not just enough to have talent you have to have heart friedgen said
3191416 hes such an unbelievable competitor the will to win is unbelievable
3191417 this is an exciting project in which we aim to increase the brand awareness of 2get2 luxury holidays with the main campaign goal of generating online enquiries and increasing sales via targeted search engine traffic

3191420 given the poor performance of these sensing devices there is no reason to believe that the other proposed protections such as beacons will be any more capable of providing reliable and robust interference protection to wireless microphone transmissions
3191421 shure appreciates the fcc the nfl and espn acknowledging the importance of wireless microphones and agreeing to conduct these tests today wireless microphones are critical to the players referees and fans if these sensing devices cannot be counted on then the fcc must put them on the bench
3191422 families have so much to worry about in terms of finances these days food should not be one of them
3191423 there are lots of ways to save money in the kitchen with a few simple behavioral changes
3191424 the governments key determination always is to provide our troops in theatre with all the protection we possibly can but at the same time particularly in this later case this was a string of bad luck
3191425 it wouldnt matter how many helicopters you have in theatre these accidents like the hard landing for example will occur and weather will occur and weather will always prevent other helicopters from taking off
3191426 up until this point people had believed that the megafauna had gone extinct in tasmania before humans had ever arrived and theyd interpreted that as some past climate change
3191427 it is a tombstone for my father who died of hunger in 1959 for the 36 million chinese who also died of hunger for the system that caused their death and perhaps for myself for writing this book
3191428 then another village and another 100 corpses no one paid attention to them people said that dogs were eating the bodies not true i said the dogs had long ago been eaten by the people

3191430 estoy esperando los resultados oficiales de la corte nacional electoral cne desde el momento en que me haga llegar la informaci n oficial voy a convocar a los prefectos al di logo
3191431 mi pedido a los prefectos es que tenemos que trabajar juntos por sus departamentos pero tambi n por bolivia la participaci n del pueblo boliviano en el referendo revocatorio nos obliga a juntarnos a ir al di logo a la unidad y a la dignidad de los bolivianos
3191432 nuestro voto tambi n ha decretado la muerte de una vez y para siempre del sistema pol tico del siglo pasado para dar paso a uno nuevo construido desde las regiones
3191433 la autonom a para los pueblos va a ser garantizada pero no para grupos ni para familias sino para la familia grande que es bolivia
3191434 there is no firm agreement among neurologists as to the number of senses because of differing definitions of what constitutes a sense one definition states that an exteroceptive sense is a faculty by which outside stimuli are perceived
3191435 a system that consists of a group sensory cell types that responds to a specific physical phenomenon and that corresponds to a particular group of regions within the brain where the signals are received and interpreted

3191438 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3191439 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3191440 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3191441 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3191442 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3191443 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3191444 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3191445 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3191446 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3191447 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3191448 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3191449 appreciates the outpouring of concern and good wishes during this difficult time
3191450 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3191451 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3191452 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3191453 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3191454 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3191455 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3191456 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3191457 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3191458 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3191459 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3191460 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3191461 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3191462 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3191463 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are

3191478 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia

3191480 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis

3191483 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3191484 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3191485 we feel so great and so happy that we are here because it is very important to the iraqi people that we are competing
3191486 we had not slept in those days because we were so worried
3191487 but here we are and i am excited for those problems i blame no one
3191488 i think its fantastic to look at them and realize that theres a universal quality in every olympian and thats overcoming challenges
3191489 but some challenges are obviously much harder than others sometimes much much harder
3191490 at the end of this article in an effort to stay focused and keep the sample uncluttered i have intentionally selected a very simple 3d scene in fact i have simply borrowed a scene from the sample in the directx sdk entitled tutorial 3 using matrices
3191491 i read a book about his obamas rise a poor simple black who became a senator my aim too is to get to the top the presidency
3191492 it was a marketing ploy the idea stuck it was on peoples minds
3191493 it wasnt a marketing strategy but this idea has brought a positive effect among people

3191495 we planned our wedding around the 04 olympics we planned our little girl being born at the end of 06 when 07 wasnt as busy
3191496 if its soon after their retirement maybe theyre appealing to and familiar to a much broader audience
3191497 you may be able to keep that going for a while but it would generally probably diminish over time
3191498 as it diminishes i think the opportunities are still there but the market gets more and more restricted
3191499 make or break if you want to do business with at amp t for example
3191500 its a one time thing that if it goes well will mean youll have repeat opportunities in the future
3191501 the majority are not going to get multimillion dollar endorsements
3191502 my goal is to work with a number of sponsors not just at the olympic games but more importantly even afterwards
3191503 and to get those things off the ground its important to get sponsorship
3191504 they seem to resonate because they let us almost escape to what we believe to have been a better time in sports
3191505 we are human beings and then we grow up and we age like anybody else
3191506 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3191507 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3191508 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3191509 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3191510 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
3191511 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3191512 russia made clear the goal of this operation is the regime change in georgia change of democratically elected government
3191513 it is quite clear what is happening we are in the process of an invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country

3191517 we decided the best and most expeditious course of action was to publicize the artwork to the general public
3191518 whether he was a thief or a good faith purchaser we couldnt come to a conclusion on that
3191519 all we know is he ended up with this stuff
3191520 i think that everybody felt like it was a breakout year for him
3191521 finally starting to sort of feel good from the first hand injury then having the hand hurt again and being able to rehab through that and finally get to the point after six long weeks to be able to come through that
3191522 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
3191523 its disappointing for me too i thought he was going to be our deadline deal getting him back healthy in the middle of the order
3191524 that leaves us three weeks for the season to be able to help in some type of capacity
3191525 we dont believe we are in a position to wait much longer for resolution of this question

3191532 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him
3191533 not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source theres just not a nicer way to say it
3191534 they just didnt now any better and he was on the floor incapacitated for a couple of days and became of victim of that
3191535 once i had to call 911 because he came over and collapsed in our front yard and so they came and took him away and there was nobody there at the home
3191536 according to what one of the officers said there was quite a lot of feces and everything just in the rooms which is a nightmare
3191537 after a decade of near stagnation new york citys graduation rate has climbed significantly since 2002
3191538 we clearly need to help larger numbers of students to graduate but the progress weve made so far means that thousands more students are graduating today than would have six years ago
3191539 i think a fifth year if it works is perfectly acceptable

3191570 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
3191571 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed

3191593 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3191594 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3191595 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3191596 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3191597 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3191598 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3191599 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3191600 we feel like we may be bigger here than we are at home
3191601 i dont know what your definition of showing off is
3191602 on a multilane roundabout the key first step is to do what you would do in any regular intersection
3191603 if you want to turn left get into the left lane going into the roundabout if you want to go right or straight out the other side stay to the right
3191604 i ride a motorcycle and when ive been on this roundabout ive had people come in fast and half the time i wonder if theyre going to stop or not im not sure they even see me
3191605 bicyclists really have two choices with a roundabout acting as vehicles in the traffic lane or essentially becoming pedestrians
3191606 most commuter riders drive just like vehicles blending right into the traffic because theyre traveling about the same speed and its not tough at all other people prefer to use pedestrian crossings and then become vehicles again on the other side and thats perfectly legal too
3191607 state law says that people in crosswalks or about to enter crosswalks have the right of way over vehicles when i want to cross at a roundabout i wave my hand and make eye contact and move forward as if to step into the traffic lane so the motorist knows i intend to cross most of the time they realize theyre supposed to stop
3191608 generally a one lane roundabout has 90 percent fewer crashes than regular intersections and the rate for multi lane roundabouts is about 35 percent less
3191609 thats why i have to say and i usually dont advocate for things in my job that i am in favor of roundabouts because of the safety factor
3191610 are usually low speed and more of a sideswipe situation with cars headed in the same direction so the force is much less and theres much less damage
3191611 but the multi lane roundabout is still officially in lane county and since they dont respond to minor accidents and most roundabout accidents are minor we dont have reliable data
3191612 we live really close to the roundabout so we have to drive through it several times a day
3191613 i slammed on my brakes and hit the horn but it didnt help i could see the look on her face she obviously didnt know what she was doing and didnt want to be there in the first place
3191614 i was in the one lane area where the people come in from martin luther king jr parkway and have nothing to do but yield to the traffic thats already there but this car drove right in and hit my front passenger fender i was a little ticked off
3191615 i live here im always so cautious i almost drive the roundabout with my hand on the horn and my foot on the brake
3191616 i never imagined id be in one accident on the roundabout much less two
3191617 i think the idea of the roundabout is perfect it actually makes traffic flow really well if people know how to use it
3191618 but im afraid it wont be possible to educate everyone now i feel that its going to happen again that because i live right here its bound to happen again
3191619 we came up with this idea because in college and university towns and also vacation spots like bend and the coast when people see items like this it makes a nice gift purchase
3191620 its not a major ticket item but if youre in a place like eugene its going to have an impact
3191621 it tells you a little something about the power of the college brand
3191622 we havent even kept up with the cost of living index
3191623 when they go to renew their leases theyre looking at huge increases
3191624 its going to allow them to fit more into the community and show more community pride
3191625 when theres a big game and everybodys got banners and merchandise theyre not the odd man out
3191626 the coalition knows full well that over two years of discussion debate and consultation on pacific island seasonal workers has already been undertaken
3191627 since 2005 weve been completely transparent about the need to bring workers in from pacific island nations and the absolute imperative of ensuring that the terms and conditions of employment be fundamentally premised on mutual benefit
3191628 in short the government the australian workers union and the community have all moved on its a shame some in the coalition have not
3191629 the meeting decided to adhere to the industrial relations recommendations and return to work to give the union and management the opportunity to negotiate the security and safety concerns that weve got
3191630 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3191631 estamos interviniendo y haciendo lo que sea necesario para enderezar esto
3191632 hay dos buenas personas que por razones distintas no son hoy parte de esta organizaci n y es una pena
3191633 el hecho es que los jugadores deben hacer un examen de conciencia y entender que tienen que responsabilizarse por parte de esto
3191634 which focused squarely on poverty racism and ending the unpopular vietnam war
3191635 i can be in the outfield and play every day
3191636 i dont want to dh i dont feel like a baseball player when i dh i dont know how to be the leader that i am from the bench i cant be a vocal leader i cant talk to guys from the bench because i dont feel right about it
3191637 i dont prefer platooning here but i understand because i got off to a slow start thats part of it but i feel im playing better now im back to being a threat i need to be
3191638 i was totally flabbergasted by that article and totally caught off guard
3191639 when we made the trade for gary sheffield we received permission from the commissioners office to speak with gary which i did
3191640 youre talking about a player thats been banged up i mean brutally banged up and still playing
3191641 a lot of people wouldnt be playing to his credit
3191642 youre doing what you think is right and somebodys mad because they got a blow i dont buy that im sorry i looked at the games thirty nine games played out of 51 before he got hurt and about seven more he wouldve played except his shoulder was clicking and he needed some time off so thats about 46 out of 51 since the stint on the disabled list its 36 out of 43 i hardly consider that platooning im sorry
3191643 they told me im not going to play the outfield so im asked to play one role and thats dh
3191644 when i come in and sometimes im not playing i dont see where i need rest to dh if other players need blows then take a blow but when other players need blows and then they dh thats all i get to do
3191645 i wouldnt let them put me down as a dh on the roster because in my mind im not going to accept that thats what i am but thats my position thats fine i understand that theres no rift in that aspect of it if that one little sentence or comment about platoon or whatever is offensive to anyone but thats just the way i see it if im not playing every day then im platooning
3191646 well then we disagree on it because thats what i call platooning i mean if youre an everyday player you play 59 out of 59 unless you cant play
3191647 call it what you want anybody can call it what they want i call it what i want
3191648 and i think the lack of production that weve gotten from gary this year is solely due to several injuries and trying to fight through it and i applaud him for trying to fight through some real serious operations
3191649 and it was the suggestion of a lot of medical people that its going to get hurt again probably worse i tried that because at one point gary suggested he felt like he hit better when he played there that did not work so im totally flabbergasted by this article
3191650 in total fairness i think that all but about three months here its been frustrating for gary because he hasnt been healthy
3191651 and nobody feels worse about that than me you talk about winning and wanting to be on a winner and everything thats why we got gary sheffield and for the last year when he was healthy he was one of the more productive players we had but i cant help it that hes had injuries thats not my fault but like i said i just got blindsided by this
3191652 im not mad at him im just saying im totally surprised by all this
3191653 im at a position in my career where i dont have to argue about anything
3191654 i dont have to dispute anything you can do whatever you want whenever you want its not going to affect me one way or another my point is that im giving you facts a guy asked me a question i answered it he asked me about my role
3191655 like i told him i dont like it but i understand thats all i said
3191656 they thought he would be much better today when he came in and he was not
3191657 when you get into a stretch like were in and the importance of this you cant have guys sitting around unavailable for six seven eight days now whether thats the case i dont know because i havent gotten the report yet
3191658 i made the suggestion that he just wait until friday when we get home so hes in front of us
3191659 i just take it day by day and listen to what he tells our trainers and our doctors
3191660 we just try to increase it every day and try to get him back as soon as hes ready
3191661 if everything goes well i think in a couple days
3191662 i feel like ive been making good progress every day taking a good step forward each time
3191663 you look at them both and theyre very good hitters
3191664 theyve been productive year after year you do miss those kinds of people

3191667 when i first saw it i just thought that you really really enjoyed programming in java
3191668 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3191669 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3191670 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3191671 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3191672 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3191673 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3191674 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3191675 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3191676 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3191677 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3191678 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3191679 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3191680 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision

3191685 how about iggy and the stooges and nine inch nails are coming up
3191686 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3191687 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3191688 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3191689 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3191690 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3191691 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3191692 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3191693 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3191694 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work

3191699 shes always smiley like me maybe thats why i like her so much
3191700 shes a sweet sweet girl but shes not afraid to speak up shes not bashful and that is also like me
3191701 the girls worked with historical research images interviews and film footage to capture the unique lives of their women partners
3191702 it was a learning opportunity on both sides a real bonding between generations
3191703 when we first started talking to the women they said they didnt have any stories to share
3191704 but as the conversations began to flow we all realized that their stories were incredible
3191705 i heard they were looking for information about the 30s and i guess they thought an old lady like me would have it
3191706 but for these kids to watch these movies and hear our stories well its better than reading a book its like traveling books never tell the full story
3191707 we inspire girls to develop their leadership potential imagination intellect and ability to create compassionate change in the world
3191708 he had a twin brother and i actually liked the brother better at first because he was a talker like me

3191712 being in a war today this film really brings the point home to youth its good to see that things arent really that different
3191713 its important to see a different perspective of that era
3191714 you dont typically see stories about the people back home during the war the people making a difference the people making history here at home
3191715 people today need to appreciate things that happen during the war
3191716 some people dont have any experience with the war and its good for them to see and learn
3191717 annie has a really amazing ability to connect with people
3191718 i worked with her before she came into our long term mentoring program she has this really natural ability to not only share authentically the individual story but also to connect the audience to it

3191721 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3191722 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3191723 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3191724 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3191725 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3191726 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3191727 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire
3191728 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia
3191729 the group of eight highly industrialized states becomes again a club of leading market democracies
3191730 it is always in our interests to engage to listen to build alliances to understand what our interests are and to be fierce in protecting those interests
3191731 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3191732 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3191733 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3191742 i really appreciate the endorsement of dfhmr there is no better acknowledgement for a candidates progressive values this endorsement is especially important because the group is made up of some of real activists people that work hard to get their candidates elected i would like to assure them that i will work equally hard for the people of the 43rd as their senator
3191743 i am also honored to have received the endorsement along with congresswoman gillibrand i have enjoyed working with her and we share many of the same values
3191744 thanks to all the candidates for their participation in our endorsement process it is important that progressive candidates feel comfortable stepping up and seeking office at all levels of government
3191745 mike has the experience strength and leadership qualities that we need in our next senator what i really appreciate about mike is that he listens and respects everyone which is especially important in our city mike has my full support
3191746 it is difficult to overstate the importance of this endorsement which comes from the largest town in the senate district people are reconsidering their previous endorsements which were made when joe bruno was still known to be the candidate now that there is a real race people are realizing that they need to put up a candidate that will be a strong experienced voice for the region and has the ability to win in the general election

3191753 meski kondisinya rusak karena dibuat lempar lemparan tapi kepala dan tulang rusuknya masih tampak
3191754 yang tampak hanya tulang batok kepala dan tulang rangka ukuran janin sangat kecil sebesar dua kepalan tangan orang dewasa
3191755 ini untuk kepentingan penyelidikan apalagi warga desa menduga bahwa penguburan janin di pondasi rumah itu tidak wajar
3191756 pada janin di usia 7 bulanan batok kepala dan tulang rangka dada memang sudah tumbuh
3191757 kami masih perlu mengeceknya dengan uji forensik dengan hasil uji forensik itu baru bisa dipastikan apakah itu janin yang keluar prematur secara alami ataukah korban aborsi

3191770 i imagine the driver of the other vehicle was with his family coming for a picnic the driver of that car with the little girl had to be killed instantly

3191793 no theological grounds for condemning or prohibiting marriage between consenting adults merely because of racial origin
3191794 laws which prohibit inhibit or hamper marriage or cohabitation between persons because of different races religions or national origins should be nullified or repealed
3191795 as such she is prohibited from marrying a negro or any descendant of a negro a mongolian or an indian a malay or a hindu or any descendants of any of them likewise as a descendant of a negro she is prohibited from marrying a caucasian or a descendant of a caucasian

3191818 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3191819 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3191820 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3191821 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3191822 finally starting to sort of feel good from the first hand injury then having the hand hurt again and being able to rehab through that and finally get to the point after six long weeks to be able to come through that
3191823 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
3191824 its disappointing for me too i thought he was going to be our deadline deal getting him back healthy in the middle of the order

3191839 the absorption of such substance by hair is extremely low if not null
3191840 if they did test positive of course they would scrutinize it and review where the substance came from and make the individual decision based on the individual case but there is the potential that performance gains could be linked to the anabolic agent
3191841 i actually have athletes calling me and reading a list of their cleaning products to me to make sure theyre safe
3191842 i think we did everything we wanted to do offensively we set some goals going in and we took care of the ball for the most part we had some big plays a bunch of guys had some really big catches we moved the ball really well and we had some good third downs
3191843 im getting in the flow of the offense and im learning the offense things are good
3191844 no matter how many women start out in physics a common trend across countries is their attrition in going from undergraduate and graduate studies to permanent positions
3191845 for all sciences the fraction of scientists who are women decreases as you go up in the hierarchy so if you start in high school taking science and then go on to college taking science and then go onto graduate school and then professors and so on at every level the fraction of women in any one field is decreasing its slightly different for different fields for example in physics the big drop is really in college in high school the classes are almost fifty fifty girls to boys but when you get to college only about 20 percent of the physics majors are women this is true for other fields of science but its especially bad in physics
3191846 they seem to be really turning people off of physics in college
3191847 women want to help people so they go into the medical sciences
3191848 whats really interesting is that sociologists and psychologists have actually done a lot of research in these areas and what they find is contrary to what many scientists think
3191849 the reason there are no women in physics is because the hardest parts to go through graduate school or to become a young faculty member happen during the years when you should be having a family and women dont think they can do both so they dont go into physics
3191850 in the science profession being objective is one of the most important qualities you can have
3191851 most of us really dont want to admit were not objective
3191852 but many scientists are reluctant to admit that because its unscientific
3191853 if we can admit that were biased then we try very hard to compensate for that bias and we try to be objective and to use objective criteria but if were quite convinced that we arent biased then we think we dont need to articulate why because were sure were unbiased and therefore it must be right
3191854 the thing about a hypothesis is that you can test it against the data
3191855 i had a new graduate student come in to talk to me after only a few weeks into the year
3191856 i told her that a lot of people could do what she did last summer but its not easy for most people to become a physicist
3191857 it turns out that these women are doing very well that theyre highly respected but the view that they have of themselves is quite low
3191858 somehow we have created this myth that doing science and physics in american universities is an elite ivory tower profession where youre pondering questions that dont have any practical applications in the real world and its all about just solving problems and being clever
3191859 as for the myth of the math gap in high school girls take as much math and physics as boys and they do just as well
3191860 what ive observed in my 25 years in the field is that there are lots of young women who are really excited about physics who just love it
3191861 but if you start talking to senior graduate students you find a very different picture
3191862 when you talk to the people who actually know them it turns out that in fact these women are doing very well that theyre highly respected but the view that they have of themselves is quite low
3191863 my personal interpretation of what happens is that we go out of our way to discourage people from pursuing physics
3191864 professors will tell you that you have to go do something else that youre not good enough the correct response is
3191865 oh you think im not good enough i guess im not let me think about what else im going to do with my life
3191866 my hypothesis which is colored by my own perception is that the more elitist the field the fewer the women
3191867 were fooling ourselves thinking were getting the cream of the crop what were really doing is chasing away really bright people
3191868 women need to better understand the mechanisms of hiring funding and promotions that is how to play the game
3191869 i think first of all they have to recognize that thats the case that there is a lot of information that they are not naturally going to get and they have to go out and seek it and for many young men maybe that isnt necessary maybe they dont have to seek it out
3191870 i think its easiest to talk to somebody to relate to like you
3191871 so the advice i give young women is find yourself a bunch of mentors first of all people at your level peers who are postdocs or faculty or whatever you are
3191872 and also go to these older guys and more or less force them to mentor you
3191873 if you are an outsider the way science runs in the us at least you really cant succeed
3191874 there are also organizations within institutions within companies within professions that make this easier
3191875 for women doubting themselves we all have self doubt and theres always another hurdle maybe its getting tenure but then you want to get elected to fellowship in your professional society
3191876 men may have many of the same self doubts and concerns about their future they just dont dare think about it for most men you dont have that option to not work it wouldnt be acceptable or its really scary or whatever
3191877 women are just constantly wondering am i good enough should i be doing this maybe i should be doing something else
3191878 in terms of having a family and getting married if you have the kind of relationship where one of you is more important than the other one then no i dont think you can have a career and a family
3191879 i have been asked so many times by women can i do physics and have a family i have never once been asked that by a young man ever its just not a question for men

3191885 the conventional wisdom on teens that they dont want to be part of wholesome organized activities but would rather hang out and become part of gangs thats the wrong conclusion they do want to join these kinds of organizations there just arent enough of them
3191886 violence often results from a complex interaction of environmental social and psychological factors such as the learned behavior of responding to conflict with violence the effects of drugs or alcohol the presence of weapons the absence of positive family relationships and adult supervision
3191887 an increasing number of public and private school administrators face situations involving serious violence perpetrated by and against adolescents school officials are responding by adding violence prevention programs often a commercially available off the shelf package to their schools already overcrowded curricula
3191888 kids who are wrongly placed in targeted violence prevention programs which ironically seem to have the greatest impact may become more violence prone than if they had not been exposed to the programs
3191889 keeping schools open for supervised extracurricular activities on afternoons evenings and weekends and during the summer keeping students away from the streets gangs drugs and boredom for even a few hours after classes will at least diminish the amount of time that the negative influences have to do their work
3191890 goldstein believed that in recognition of the reality of american policing line officers would be given the freedom to develop creative solutions to community problems beyond simply making arrests or doing nothing
3191891 much of the growing literature on community policing tends to be qualitative in nature
3191892 the onset of puberty the increased presence of alcohol drugs and weapons in a young persons environment and growing economic pressures all increase the risk of being a perpetrator or a victim of violence
3191893 more extracurricular experience e g work and leadership experience number of hobbies would statistically contribute to the use of the more complex and creativity generating thinking styles and in higher self esteem
3191894 the first type of thinking styles are creativity generating and require complex information processing the second type of thinking styles require simplistic information processing
3191895 as predicted students extracurricular experiences such as work and leadership experience statistically accounted for their individual differences in both the more complex thinking styles e g legislative judicial global and liberal and their self esteem scores
3191896 suffice it to say that as a chronic stressor poverty contributes to distress in the form of economic hardships poor accessibility to health care limited resources feelings of powerlessness and low educational achievement

3191918 you know i must think more of my poor wife i wouldnt want her to go without
3191919 i mean havent you ever watched a horror film there are rules yes like in
3191920 and even though that particular storyline took place in a modern day american suburb i am pretty sure walking
3191921 though its slightly ironic how the character who originally narrates the rules in the first instalment of the scream trilogy was then later horribly killed in the second part only to be resurrected on screen in the last film via a video he apparently recorded prior to his gruesome murder in order to impart some more rule based wisdom which he obviously didnt follow very well seeing as he was speaking from beyond the grave
3191922 even so i think my original point was valid hey are you even listening to me hellooooo
3191923 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to do the job from day one in fact she never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
3191924 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3191925 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3191926 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values he told the people of nh yesterday he has a kansas accent because his mother was from there his mother lived in many states as far as we can tell but this is an example of the nonsense he uses to cover this up
3191927 we found that price is not necessarily an indicator of quality when it comes to the quality of picture on your television screen in fact some less expensive models actually offered better picture quality
3191928 frankly our federal government who mandated this transition and is asking consumer to pay for something they once got for free isnt doing a very good job educating the public
3191929 know your choices before you go into a retail store so that you dont end up spending money on equipment that you dont need or cant use
3191930 and lastly youve got a fuel leak around the carburetor
3191931 i need to get these things fixed can i get an estimate
3191932 well we wont know until we can take a look at it power steering it could be something simple like a hose that will cost 30 or we might need to replace the entire steering rack which could be 800
3191933 and the fuel leak once again could be something simple otherwise you might be looking at 600
3191934 no idea who it is but has an open and engaging style
3191935 a city where walking is the most dangerous form of transportation over the last five years the number of pedestrians killed by cars was double that of drivers and passengers killed in car accidents
3191936 push buttons are stupid because cars dont have to push a button
3191937 the best way to balance the system is to consider how many people you move not how many vehicles
3191938 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion
3191939 more importantly squelching research and scientific discussion wont stop the attackers it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes
3191940 we were tracking it earlier in that week and we knew that things were escalating
3191941 i can tell you it moved quicker than we anticipated that first day
3191942 appearance is important and self esteem is important when you feel good you look good
3191943 you know all of us physically get up and say i can do anything i want today
3191944 the way people see you your personality and how people notice you as a person and who you are
3191945 were always concerned with lasers in the cockpit of an aircraft because of the dangers to the pilots and co pilots themselves and the possibility of an aircraft coming down
3191946 the us military instructors directly command and coordinate actions of mercenaries without being involved in actual fighting the source specified according to intelligence data there are roughly 1 000 military instructors of the united states in georgia
3191947 task force of russia has annihilated a few groups of mercenaries some of mercenaries have been captured and investigators are working with them the source said
3191948 we have detained 10 agents of the georgian special services who were spying on military facilities and preparing terrorist attacks including on russian territory
3191949 its completely surreal and we are really uneasy we dont dare any more to propose any price below 170 million for these clients anything below and they throw you out and you should see how they do it at this price tag we are beyond luxury and even reality
3191950 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him
3191951 not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source theres just not a nicer way to say it
3191952 they just didnt now any better and he was on the floor incapacitated for a couple of days and became of victim of that
3191953 once i had to call 911 because he came over and collapsed in our front yard and so they came and took him away and there was nobody there at the home
3191954 according to what one of the officers said there was quite a lot of feces and everything just in the rooms which is a nightmare
3191955 the world of reggaeton taking over latin america and the us
3191956 i started dreaming that i was a blue man and the dreams just kept coming and coming
3191957 other than that we look for sort of the it factor the blue man it factor
3191958 i always kind of had a feeling that i would like to end up somewhere in the music world
3191959 life happens you get married you get started on a different path
3191960 then you get a break like this and you can start to pursue some of the things you wanted to when you were a lot younger
3191961 im an actor and a drummer its the two things ive been best at my entire life combined into one
3191962 but what about nato with americas support georgia will become a member of nato wont that make a difference
3191963 this is good news for a young man who appeared to have an excellent career in front of him
3191964 but it also sends out a message to everyone about the duty of care they have to their opponents
3191965 i kind of slacked off a little during the super 14 so it was a good chance to get back with auckland because my confidence went down
3191966 they told me to put my head down and go back and work hard with the auckland npc team and get my fitness back up there
3191967 there wasnt really any area of my game they just told me to go back and work for me its probably my fitness first and also my defensive lines
3191968 i kind of slacked off a bit the last few games during the super 14 so those were the two things i wanted to work on
3191969 i dont mind playing fullback we had no one to play there for auckland so i ended up back there and it went okay
3191970 its where i played my first test for the all blacks against scotland and i played a whole season with the hurricanes i dont mind too much as long as i get on im pretty happy
3191971 its just one of those things pre match tactics of putting something out there to stir it up its nothing different to what any other team does
3191972 everyones looking for that edge and whatever we are doing they will be doing something as well i would say
3191973 i havent heard exactly what hes said but every week theres been allegations that somebodys cheating and it goes both ways its become familiar territory to us really
3191974 we are glad to see cnpc participating in the beijing olympic games as an official partner in the category of crude oil and natural gas
3191975 we will transport oil and gas by whichever route is profitable
3191976 we are opening the caspian route at the request of turkmenistan
3191977 existing technical legal environmental and other risks relating to the trans caspian project are so great that it would be impossible to find an investor
3191978 unless this is a political project and then it does not matter what would be inside the pipeline as long as it exists
3191979 if these claims are substantiated and if the turkmens find investors to produce this gas the possibility of the trans caspian pipeline remains on the table
3191980 if politicians really have a strong desire to get more gas that would bypass russia they could offer to incur some financial losses and risks
3191981 we take our responsibility in the world energy supply very seriously
3191982 this pipeline is of strategic importance not only to azerbaijan but to the other new independent states as well
3191983 this is a reliable way to the world markets take turkmenistan with its huge resources of natural gas and no access to the world markets as a result the turkmens have to sell their gas 2 5 times cheaper than the world price
3191984 the new conduit stands to severely weaken russias grip on regional energy exports
3191985 i have no doubt they wanted to target the pipeline there is nothing else here
3191986 curiosity and where star trek may have got it wrong
3191987 the av companies are getting tens of thousands of new attack samples a week
3191988 and a lot of these samples have to be broken down by their security labs and you can only process so much at a time
3191989 today the threat environment has transformed to a more complex supply chain where players are highly specialized and consequently more productive
3191990 vulnerabilities are sold to software developers who create packaged malware generation software that can then be used by multiple types of attackers and are capable of generating multiple unique targeted attacks and are continuously updated with new exploits
3191991 some malware packages have even gone open source consequently the ability to launch a sophisticated targeted attack is no longer limited to those that have technical knowledge increasing the potential universe of attackers
3191992 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3191993 there were blacks among the dead who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
3191994 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3191995 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them
3191996 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3191997 this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
3191998 should change their minds and return to civilised means of resolving difficult political questions
3191999 it is still not too late to prevent a massive bloodbath and new victims including among civilians
3192000 continue its pursuit of efforts to prevent the spilling of blood and for the process of resolving the situation to return to peaceful means
3192001 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the in 1985
3192002 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3192003 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3192004 they can do what they want with it but he doesnt remember anything he remembers nothing before 1993 except for little bits and pieces

3192008 our main goal with this new site is to use its original content to help us climb back to the top in search engine ranking
3192009 in order to attract more traffic to sextoy com we decided to focus on unique content from three blogs

3192012 we thought this would be a good place to aggregate all that content

3192029 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point

3192041 will largely depend on the performance in the final quarter where 33 per cent of earnings before interest and tax traditionally occurs and there being no further deterioration in the new zealand trading environment

3192076 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff bewkes and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3192077 aside from the challenge to develop an innovative title with spectacular levels and new controls the focus in cursed mountain is the overwhelming environment of the himalayas
3192078 it is really important to us that the player experiences natures powers as realistically as possible and that the games viewing distance allows the player to see the monumental landscapes at all times we are also going to great lengths to make the dead souls look as convincing as possible in order to deliver the level of immersion necessary for really effective and believable survival horror

3192192 the high price of gasoline is ruining our economy and driving families that were already on the brink over the edge
3192193 one solution for immediate relief is to place a windfall profits tax on big oil executives and stop giving them taxpayer money on top of world record oil profits
3192194 the last thing we need right now is more taxes
3192195 we increase the cost to the consumer to turn around and give it back to them
3192196 the new windfall profits tax proposed is good for us independent oil operators
3192197 in the 1987 the multinationals and opec got together to drive down the price of oil and force smaller independents out of business so they could come back and raise prices once most of us were out of business
3192198 when i ran last cycle i warned of 4 to 5 a gallon gas if we didnt change and we didnt

3192202 if the u s petroleum industry doesnt reduce its refining capacity it will never see any substantial increase in refinery margins profits
3192203 raise significant questions about whether americas oil companies tried to pull off a financial triple play boosting profits by reducing refinery capacity tagging consumers with higher pump prices and then arguing for environmental rollbacks
3192204 why is our rep mike pence grandstanding in congress instead of working toward real solutions to high gas prices maybe its because hes taken 30 000 from the big oil companies hes been part of a failed energy policy written by big oil in the last eight years weve seen oil profits soar as the price of gasoline has gone from 2 to 4 a gallon big oil keeps running the show getting billions in tax breaks
3192205 overall 70 percent of pences donations come from individuals and only 1 percent from oil companies
3192206 the idea that the oil industry in any way influences his voting is ridiculous

3192228 when the pin is pulled mr grenade is not our friend
3192229 cluster bombing from b 52s is very very accurate the bombs are guaranteed to always hit the ground

3192251 rockefeller and his blue eyed daughter reigh storrow boss had gripped the us publics imagination
3192252 they can do what they want with it but he doesnt remember anything he remembers nothing before 1993 except for little bits and pieces
3192253 clark rockefeller who triggered a manhunt in july after allegedly abducting his daughter was in fact christian karl gerhartsreiter

3192268 voy a esperar que el proyecto salga de la c mara porque hay una serie de negociaciones en tr mite de distinto tipo formales informales p blicas subterr neas y por lo tanto hay que esperar que el proyecto llegue al senado de repente cambian el proyecto en estos d as en la c mara y quedamos pedaleando en el aire
3192269 nunca hay que votar las cosas a priori ni ponerse en situaciones que no corresponden

3192271 on that evening he said that he hadnt worn a condom for four years i said that he must wear one later on oh you are wearing a safety hat
3192272 yes i wear one almost daily a safety hat i havent been wearing that other one recently the condom
3192273 the runner fan incident is the typical subject for danwei org i think that foreigners take a very biased view of china they think that there is no freedom of speech in china they think that everything is totally like the cultural revolution without any voice from the people but it is not that simple for example there is a lot of debate over runner fan people are debating whether he was wrong ot he was a hero or he was a shameless vile person
3192274 i dont care who is right or wrong the key is that people are able to debate about moral issues five year ago i dont think that there is such room for this kind of discussion his story is significant with respect to the change in chinese society i like this kind of topic
3192275 when westerners see this kind of campaign they immediately classify this under categories such as corruption or freedom within their fixed framework they make the obvious judgment
3192276 an individual media comes from the grassroots and its voice is more authentic
3192277 foreigners actually do not have too many channels to understand china
3192278 some foreigners decry us as the running dogs of the chinese government some chinese netizens angrily denounce me because a foreigner knows fart and is unqualified to comment on china
3192279 yes i am not extreme i also want to express that for the westerners this should not be the cultural revolution again the voices of the chinese netizens should be more diversified with less from the angry youth
3192280 today it is really intimidating for a foreigner such as myself to talk about china especially since the famous summer palace is right behind me but fortunately south africa was not of the eight allied nations that looted and torched the summer palace so i am not as terrified
3192281 today we will not discuss culture instead we will talk about foul language
3192282 the muzimei interview was the one with the highest number of hits on the internet for danwei tv
3192283 i love avant garde design but i dont want to get rid of tradition after the olympics i hope that the control should be tighter about the preservation certain beijing histories
3192284 this change is not just organic growth but it is an explosive growth
3192285 he is totally aware of what is happening at every nook and corner in china compared to the foreign correspondents based in china jeremy goldkorn should become their consultant
3192286 these videos were the collaborative effort with sophia and an american friend sophia likes to make films and i like to produce for the internet afterwards we had different directions of development i told them that they could use the yellow safety hat image if they want
3192287 i have to solve the problem of making a living first and it is expensive to make a video
3192288 a feeling of crisis sometimes there are times when i think that i have made a lot of small accomplishments but i have never achieved anything big this feeling should
3192289 i have several meaningful projects which i hope can offer some stability as well as creative satisfaction i have been trying to seek the balance and i am still on the path
3192290 our coach loved li ning above all and he liked the chinese training model of course we did not have a sports work team as in china and we must learn at school
3192291 the level of gymnastics in south africa is not much to speak of and i was an athlete about whom there is not much to speak of in a country in which gymnastics is not too much to speak of
3192292 wang xiaofeng said that he had the desire to perform a pole dance before people so do i
3192293 the people whom i work with are artists photographers moviemakers reporters these are the most unconventional people of course this is not just a chinese problem the group is the same way in the west this is a problem about this circle
3192294 this is the first time ever in the world that everyone has such an opportunity
3192295 i did not want to make this a very commercialized website it should not carry any advertisements it should have a unique character or else the flavor of the contents will change but the key is that i cannot make a living off it if i can make a living off it i will concentrate on doing this
3192296 there is always someone asking me about where my safety hat is

3192300 ik zal de manier waarop ik de groep heb toegesproken niet becommentari ren maar iedereen heeft de boodschap begrepen
3192301 ik weet nu perfect wie mee verdrinkt als het schip zinkt en wie blijft vechten om te overleven de spelers moeten begrijpen dat ze zich allemaal moeten blijven inzetten ook als de ploeg niet draait
3192302 over de boetes heb ik het met de trainer niet gehad
3192303 het is echter wel zo dat er een sportief reglement is en dat de trainersstaf de spelers boetes kan opleggen als ze disciplinaire fouten begaan laten we er eerst maar van uitgaan dat de spelers zelf deze moeilijke periode zullen overwinnen zonder boetes ze moeten uit zichzelf hun sportieve plichten nakomen
3192304 while one applauds what could be thought of as an openness to other religions one has to wonder if this is essentially bland secularism in which all religions are constructed by humans and therefore equally true or untrue among religionists who dont understand their own faith
3192305 i think leaders of religious communities will look at this finding and ask how they can more effectively educate their communities both about their own faith and that of others
3192306 being an evangelical christian is not about a denominational label and affiliation with a political party or simply defining yourself as an evangelical

3192413 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel

3192530 among adults with vision problems a public health gap exists in actual access to eye care services between canada and the united states primarily owing to the population without health insurance in the united states
3192531 however although health insurance is associated with increased use of preventive services and recommended treatments simply providing health insurance to all persons may be insufficient to increase the percentage of individuals who use eye care services or to improve vision related outcomes economic status and optional vision insurance are also significantly associated with rates of use of eye care services
3192532 therefore public health interventions targeting adults with vision problems without health insurance might be more beneficial if they focused on those at risk for serious vision loss especially those in the lowest income group
3192533 in both canada and the united states general health insurance covers medical payment for eye injury and various eye diseases such as cataract glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy and optional vision insurance provides additional insurance coverage for eye examinations contact lenses and eyeglasses and or frames and in some instances part of the costs for elective laser surgery for vision correction

3192549 and it is precisely here where the opposition will try and neutralise us
3192550 we have picked up three things that they do which are illegal in the lineouts
3192551 it starts with their flanker coming through the lineout illegally to stop any ball thrown down to the scrumhalf
3192552 the combination of killer sounds straightforward looping and simple stompbox design

3192554 given the poor performance of these sensing devices there is no reason to believe that the other proposed protections such as beacons will be any more capable of providing reliable and robust interference protection to wireless microphone transmissions
3192555 shure appreciates the fcc the nfl and espn acknowledging the importance of wireless microphones and agreeing to conduct these tests today wireless microphones are critical to the players referees and fans if these sensing devices cannot be counted on then the fcc must put them on the bench

3192575 i think they should hear georgia will never surrender georgia will never surrender
3192576 no matter how superhuman a military you have if you have not been preparing the attack for months and months for gods sake how can you mobilise into another country 1 000 tanks within hours if its not a premeditated attack on a neighbouring country
3192577 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3192578 we will go to the end because we once lost our freedom to russia
3192579 its clipped the rear of one of the b doubles before it rolled on its side and the cabin hit the other b double thats as much as we know at this stage
3192580 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3192581 on arrival at the site an isaf medevac helicopter was damaged in a hard landing rendering it incapable of completing its casualty evacuation task
3192582 his family have a very strong support unit but all of them are just incredibly shocked
3192583 and just really really looking to find out more so that way we can begin planning to celebrate lees life in the correct way
3192584 theyre having a memorial in sydney but were hoping to get lees body flown to the uk to bury him here
3192585 he ran regularly it was part of his training for football
3192586 shes got a good family and friends supporting her but obviously shes very much in shock
3192587 i believe they were just about to move in together
3192588 he would have a drink occasionally at a party but i should imagine that if he was doing something like a run he would have stayed in with michelle the night before
3192589 its just a terrible shame he was a wonderful individual who is going to be greatly missed
3192590 he was such a fantastic amazing caring fun loving person
3192591 he made everyone laugh and lived his life to the full he was living his dream in oz and seemed so in love with his girlfriend its devastating that he has been taken from us
3192592 im going to be in the business of selling race parts a lot longer than using them to race
3192593 i used a big chunk of the sponsorship money to buy the building
3192594 i sweated bullets that whole season but we went on to win the championship
3192595 i felt very accomplished in 91 when i beat a group b car to win a national championship
3192596 we raced what we saw when we went flying over the crest of a hill we did it blind and had no idea what was on the other side
3192597 i was looking for something with four wheel drive but that was more suitable to the american public
3192598 i was a pioneer i pride myself on being ahead of the curve but i missed it by about 10 years
3192599 so we thought why not sell them too since we needed to generate more money to support the race team
3192600 they had a six story headquarters building and two floors worth of executives were laid off
3192601 because of our past experience with subaru we were going to specialize in parts for them
3192602 but when we looked real hard at the numbers it showed that subaru represented only one half of one percent of all the new car sales in the us and only two percent of those buyers were interested in high performance
3192603 a lot of them built inventory that was antiquated in three months
3192604 this takes us outside the world of rallying off road and takes us into the midgets and other open wheel cars asa and other kinds of stock cars
3192605 so that we get as many potential customers as possible
3192606 every success in the racing business has a niche where nobody can compete with
3192607 i grew up with walker evans many time baja 1000 champion and have been around off road racing all of my life
3192608 this seat has survived 63 gs on rear impact which is the maximum on the test sled
3192609 the seat kept trickling and trickling down onto other teams
3192610 i have gone over a 50 foot cliff and ive barrel rolled 15 times
3192611 because we chose the best equipment i never broke a bone while i was racing
3192612 you wont find anything in our store that we wouldnt use in our own cars
3192613 you have a responsibility to your customer to know your product and when to move somebody up or down the line
3192614 you have to make them comfortable with you first remember its not about you its about them if you get a customer comfortable with where they shop then you can help them know what they need
3192615 there is the wal mart approach with piles of merchandise on the floor assuming that the customer just wants to get in and get out
3192616 but most racers dont know enough about technology and that gives us a chance to have a discussion with them and a repeat customer is one you give knowledge
3192617 keeping the vertebrae perfectly stacked and as rigid as possible
3192618 the safety is not in the shell but from whats packed inside of it
3192619 i have closed cockpit racers who want to spend extra money on a kevlar helmet but they dont need that level of puncture protection i try to get them to stay in a helmet with a fiberglass shell and put the extra money toward a driving suit thats better for them at the end of the day the customer who is comfortable with their equipment will go fast
3192620 we have a lot of racers who come in on a budget and i understand that because i had to do it too
3192621 i tell them to trust me almost everyone who buys entry level stuff will come back to buy something better so why not save money by buying something a little better to start with
3192622 you have to categorize your buyers and gain information about what they like before you can approach them about a new product
3192623 as your relationship with them evolves you may get to inject your opinion gradually
3192624 you have to give them the full schooling because you have the knowledge
3192625 when i first started i could sell the same gloves and shoes for 10 years
3192626 now you have to stay on top of the technology
3192627 you just have to read i havent read a novel in 10 years but i have read every catalog in our business today with search engines on the internet you can educate yourself very quickly
3192628 for the most part racers wait to the last minute and buy whats available
3192629 i keep at least three months of inventory of any product because you never know when things are going to pick up
3192630 what hurts is when a customer needs something you dont have
3192631 we had six different types of driving suits in stock and he could try all of them on in one place
3192632 you have to keep it on the shelf and cover at least a months worth of sales
3192633 if its still good for years to come over time enough people will feel the need for the old reliable
3192634 im a big advocate of advertising especially in print media
3192635 because they are creative and they give me things that are different
3192636 its a tasteful elaboration on beauty without becoming a girlie thing
3192637 monet and picasso are just two artists who celebrated the human form
3192638 our campaign is a piece of art but it also has a message that our seats fit the human body
3192639 all of these women have fans and it brings people to our web site and into our store
3192640 no way could i afford an ad in the super bowl but this gave us exposure all over a national network
3192641 i was a factory driver for subaru for 10 years and a five time national champion here in the united states and u s pro rally so my background is off road when i started this company while i was racing my goal was bringing european rally products i e off road products unavailable here in the u s to the american consumer
3192642 our second date was a plane ticket to go watch the olympus rally in washington
3192643 i took a ride in a rally car it did things you wouldnt think a truck could do thats where i got the bug
3192644 our breadth of product and our breadth of customer base has changed and grown dramatically
3192645 we might have to look at relocating its like living on a ship you use space the best you can
3192646 but our roots have always been in off road racing for instance some of our customers include riviera racing terrible herbst racing baldwin racing robby gordon racing collins enterprises the list goes on and on were a lot broader in the off road market than most people seem to think
3192647 we draw a line with regards to the quality of the safety equipment if i wouldnt use it personally then i wont sell it
3192648 one of the fallacies for the beginner racer is to come in and buy the cheapest product possible
3192649 then once they go and utilize that equipment for one or two races they have to go back and repurchase that item because it wasnt up to the standard they should have bought at their primary purchase
3192650 weve had a nice steady growth throughout the years with some of the exclusive contracts weve made
3192651 that allowed us to minimize our staff and maximize our outputs
3192652 trying to join the party after the partys half over ive always striven to find that product that i believe will be the best product a couple of years from now thats where we see growth thats where the money is like the stock market
3192653 as a sportsman i believe sport has a major role to play in promoting environmental issues so i will work with young people across the world and try to inspire them to plant trees use energy efficient light bulbs harvest rain water and to become environmental champions in their own communities
3192654 as the world celebrates the beijing olympic games i would also like to call upon the organizers of all major sports events in the world to make sure they use public transport facilities build proper waste management systems and use greener forms of energy
3192655 i sincerely believe small actions done by many over a long period of time can really bring about positive change by doing a little now we can avoid doing a lot later please join me in this global team effort
3192656 i appealed to their patriotism thats why i ran you want people who are running for the right reason

3192741 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 per cent of controls
3192742 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3192743 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3192744 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3192745 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3192746 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise

3192758 the whole conflict is not being waged over the pipeline the reasons are definitely geopolitical
3192759 however the russians know the pipeline is important to georgia and may try to damage it they have the capability to do so
3192760 this shows that russia has not just targeted georgian economic outlets but international economic outlets
3192761 for europeans an alternative supply route is psychological reassurance its having a route that does not go through russia
3192762 but the other countries the pipeline passes through may ultimately prove more unreliable

3192794 we had real good execution and came out ready to play early the guys were definitely focused and played fast early but we missed a couple of big plays for touchdowns and we cant have that happen sometimes you only get so many big plays to score

3192807 johnny had a past history of drug abuse but once we became aware of it a year ago he got help and we helped him
3192808 for us to find him dead and to hear about the toxicology report is still a shock
3192809 after we went to bed maybe he thought ive been clean for a long time maybe he was rewarding himself addictive behavior is strange sometimes but his tolerance had definitely gone down and its tragic
3192810 the most obvious question people are going to assume that since we play in a rock band that this was because of an alcohol or drug overdose but i can vouch for him it wasnt anything like that at all
3192811 our band is drug free and he knew that and we believed that he was he just slipped up
3192812 i wish it wasnt something like heroin because when something like this happens people look at the person who died as some kind of freak or something
3192813 but really he was an amazing kid he was so amazing that his mind just ran all the time i just hope that wherever hes at now he has that peace that he wanted

3192878 but it is important to remember that there are very good treatments available
3192879 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3192880 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3192881 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3192882 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3192883 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3192884 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3192885 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3192886 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3192887 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3192888 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3192889 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3192890 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3192891 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3192892 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3192893 who are open to doing something on the production side
3192894 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3192895 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3192896 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3192897 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3192898 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3192899 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3192900 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3192901 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3192902 it meant so much to our family that our fellow kelowna residents came out to support connor and canadian blood services
3192903 my son would not be where he is today if not for the blood donated by generous canadians and for that we are truly grateful
3192904 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3192905 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3192906 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3192907 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3192908 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3192909 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3192910 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3192911 if you want things to be different perhaps the answer is to become different yourself
3192912 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3192913 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3192914 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3192915 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3192916 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3192917 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3192918 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3192919 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3192920 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3192921 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3192922 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3192923 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3192924 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3192925 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3192926 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3192927 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3192928 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3192929 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3192930 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3192931 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3192932 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3192933 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3192934 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3192942 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3192943 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3192944 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3192945 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3192946 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3192947 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3192948 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3192949 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3192950 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3192951 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3192952 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3192953 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3192954 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3192955 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

3192957 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3192958 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

3192968 congress this week passed a law to help curb piracy on college campuses the higher education opportunity act passed wednesday by the house and thursday by the senate promotes education legal alternatives and improved monitoring of campus networks if signed into law by president george w bush the bipartisan bill would require publicly funded universities and colleges to teach students and employees about illegal downloading distribution of copyrighted materials and related campus policies the bill also requires universities and colleges to create plans to prevent piracy by using technology and to present legal alternatives the bill would provide grants to support those efforts

3193000 despite the impressive political energy and resources focused on education our members believe the government has generally performed poorly in this critical area there is a substantial credibility gap between what official statistics show and what employers feel on the front line
3193001 we are tackling employers concerns head on with the biggest education reform for generations business concerns about school leavers reflect the reality of the changing economy with historic low unemployment and the virtual elimination of low skill jobs the reality is that employers rightly have far higher expectations of workers skills than ever before

3193029 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3193030 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3193031 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3193032 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3193033 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3193034 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3193035 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3193036 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3193074 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3193075 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3193076 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3193077 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3193078 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
3193079 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3193080 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire

3193083 it is always in our interests to engage to listen to build alliances to understand what our interests are and to be fierce in protecting those interests
3193084 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3193085 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3193086 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3193087 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3193088 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3193089 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3193090 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species

3193094 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision

3193102 pratt institute students demonstrated depth of thought and creativity in designing homes to maximize the use of daylight and air flow afforded by skylights
3193103 we are proud to team with the pratt institute and other leading manufacturers to give the architectural and general public a taste of the design insights derived from these studios
3193104 our inspiration for the home was our observation of growing trends in the american family to separate family members
3193105 by creating variations in the amount and quality of light entering various zones within the home and further playing with the light through interior wall treatments we achieved a series of spaces that promote family gathering
3193106 integrating the skylights natural lighting and ventilation systems into the home brought the exterior environment inside and allowed the home to breathe as a homogenous system

3193126 weve always known hes a fantastic talent but to be honest this couldnt have happened to a nicer guy
3193127 buyers are buying but they are being more cautious theres more discipline and no sort of irrationality out there when it comes to buying people are more prepared to miss out
3193128 for a city the size of hamilton even in these conditions youd expect that to be closer to 280 that shows that there are parts of the city where stocks are low and people are just holding on to their homes
3193129 we are really lacking a lot of nice quality homes there are a lot of stale properties on the market that have been there for some time
3193130 there isnt that level of frenzied activity that there was last year where people were buying because they feared theyd miss out if the prices kept on going up
3193131 we used to see people look at a house that ticked five boxes and theyd buy it now people are happy to pass a house over if its not right
3193132 at this stage expectations and the general feeling is that sale prices are likely to fall a little more before levelling out as we enter the spring months
3193133 flirting is a womans trade and one must keep in constant practice

3193136 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between and distant observations of impacts on species
3193137 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3193138 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3193139 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3193393 these are similar to kiosks consumers are already familiar with
3193394 consumers are already comfortable with buying cosmetics and other items like this from vending machines

3193398 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3193399 this things going to crest a half a billion soon
3193400 who knows maybe it will be a 1 billion marketplace at some point in time
3193401 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3193402 the popularity of the iphone makes it an ideal platform for developing applications that incorporate quality real time voip giving consumers real world communication experiences like in game multi person chat
3193403 a limited number of development companies are already using the software but we cant divulge who is developing what but we anticipate great gaming chat and multi party voice applications to hit the market soon
3193404 senator mccain has sent a clear signal that he would seek to end the massive deficits that have occurred during the bush administration and the last 10 years that the republicans controlled congress
3193405 under george w bush dennis hastert tom delay bill frist and ted stevens the republican party was transformed from the party of fiscal responsibility to the party of spend and spend elect and elect john mccain may very well be serious in wanting the gop to return to its ideological roots
3193406 this insanity must stop senator mccains embrace of deficit hawk david walker is a strong indicator to conservatives and independents that he intends to try to do something to stop these irresponsible deficits
3193407 i might note that david walker has also talked with the fiscal advisers of senator barack obama so perhaps there is something hopeful in that as well
3193408 after all walker was appointed head of the general accounting office gao by president clinton and was appointed as assistant secretary of labor by president reagan
3193409 republicans and democrats should be able to agree that the annual budget deficits are unconscionable and that the cumulative national debt threatens our childrens future

3193415 yet again the consumer is being hit with inflation busting price rises each month we are currently seeing a different utility company increase its prices
3193416 our latest research findings show that a quarter of the uk now see eating three meals a day as a luxury the costs of basic essential items like water bills are now pushing many people across the uk towards poverty
3193417 what has happened to me is like a poisoned fruit that came from a poisoned tree
3193418 we have to establish the status of his return to england and where that leaves him as regards to the legal process in thailand scudamore stressed
3193419 until such a time as he is convicted he falls within the rules but we have always said that the test is meaningful and has to be applied we need to make sure that if he is guilty of anything we will deal with it
3193420 the more he spoke to me about it the more i realised he had a wonderful idea for a light entertainment show
3193421 he wanted me to do it very badly and it changed my life
3193422 knew how to treat performers how to get them to do things even if they didnt want to
3193423 he knew what the public wanted and gave the public what they wanted it is a very sad day
3193424 without bill i dont think the show would have gone on
3193425 he undoubtedly had a nose for a hit he was a showman and theres not many of his type about i loved him
3193426 i did not hit eddie braben the writer of the morecambe and wise show with a soda siphon my daughter collects them and i treat them as an endangered species in the interests of the bbc i did however hit him behind his writing ear with a ping 9 iron it had the desired effect he never wrote for morecambe and wise for itv as well as he did for the bbc
3193427 one of the reasons that the care taken on light entertainment had to be the same care as was taken for ballet or opera or serious drama is because you are contributing to the culture of the country i think its sad if it isnt
3193428 basically television was a performers medium and news and current affairs were the sideshow
3193429 it did not seem proper to take a licence fee and give no service to a section of the audience many of whom were the very people who find the licence fee quite an item in their expenditure old age pensioners the unemployed and the shift workers
3193430 i think ah for you my dears the skys the limit please dont be astronauts
3193431 he had a pop at me before the last dive when we were sitting down
3193432 i saw my mum in the audience and i asked her to give me a call and tom went to me why are you on the phone were still in the competition and weve got another dive to do thats just thomas hes over nervous and thats how it was today thomas should not be worrying about what im doing but today he was worrying about everyone and everything and that to me is really the sole reason why he didnt perform today
3193433 when tom hears about this i dont suppose hell want to dive with him again
3193434 if you cant take it on the chin you shouldnt be there perhaps blakes got sour grapes its easy to blame a 14 year old but its not exactly team spirit
3193435 its a synchro team theres two of us and thats the hard thing about it
3193436 both of you have to be on your game at the same time and that just didnt happen today
3193437 thomas is 14 years old hes done phenomenally and for me to be a part of a partnership with him is a great thing i knew that we were capable of a medal but i also knew that it depended on how tom performed i wasnt on the top of my game but i out dived thomas today and thats not something that normally happens he was very nervous more so than ever before i think he really struggled to get through the competition and as his partner it was hard for me to get up there and try and ease him into it unfortunately for me it didnt work today
3193438 hes a great kid hes like a little brother to me
3193439 i was quite disappointed but it was a great experience and i really enjoyed myself i had so much fun out there we just had a bad day i tried to not make it feel different but there was lots of pressure on me and i was very nervous
3193440 it was there for the taking but it wasnt my day today now im looking at 2012 like ive always said
3193441 and i hope he takes a lot of experience from this and that it stands him in good stead unfortunately i dont have another chance
3193442 after the glasgow east byelection no one can doubt that labour is in a deep hole
3193443 this is much more serious than mid term blues which may be expected to evaporate as the general election approaches
3193444 first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3193445 dangling the carrot of home ownership in front of low income council tenants in current market conditions for example is a deeply suspect proposition
3193446 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved
3193447 by 1995 the position had changed the electorate had decisively shifted their loyalty to tony blairs government in waiting and nothing could save john major we are not yet in that position today david cameron has still not secured the unequivocal support of the electorate
3193448 over the past year the negative impact of equities on scheme assets combined with falling bond yields have led to an overall worsening of the funding position resulting in a 8 6 increase in aggregate liabilities while weaker equities have reduced assets by 7 4
3193449 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3193450 the rangers supporters have been fantastic but i am young and want to play at the highest level and i hope they will always welcome me back i want to thank them for everything
3193451 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cu llar has been a great player for this football club
3193452 faith and i have joked about doing on golden pond on broadway when we get older
3193453 the idea of me being a crotchety old dude im not far from that now
3193454 im not a moderate person and ill be the first to say there have been times when things were taken to the extreme
3193455 i got really fat i want to take care of myself
3193456 oh no im not yelling at you dude im just surprised thats all
3193457 kelly kim opened for 275 000 brandon cantu re raised to 950 000 and dean hamrick moved all in
3193458 the most talked about hand of the day involved an all in confrontation between jordan morgan and joe hachem
3193459 if i can subsist on the kittens food portion then i dont have to touch my stash
3193460 she took the bowl away the bowl with my extra food stash now ill have to cut into my reserve stash and beyond that starvation
3193461 det r uppenbart att fetmans negativa effekter p folkh lsan antingen har verdrivits eller uppv gts av andra gynnsamma faktorer
3193462 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3193463 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3193464 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3193465 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3193466 suddenly you find youre out there walking in a storm
3193467 i just started converting on the big points much better
3193468 i missed a couple shots and he came up with a good shot and the next thing you know he won the second set
3193469 i was a little nervous out there to be honest with you
3193470 he made me play a set i wasnt happy with
3193471 thats the exciting part that im not really being held back by any of my injuries
3193472 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3193473 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3193474 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3193475 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3193476 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3193477 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3193478 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3193479 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3193480 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3193481 i want to set fire to rome because i can
3193482 even if you had broken your tail bone its not like we could do anything like going in there and resetting it so you sort of have to give it time to heal
3193483 well just make a belt it hangs from or something the point is that you have to use it
3193484 as i said to the boys in the locker room its just how the game goes sometimes
3193485 you have to handle it right and not get your heads down
3193486 we have some unfinished business and well go into wednesdays game against nigeria fully prepared any result other than a loss will give us a pass to the quarterfinals maybe we should have taken care of this business on sunday but before this game i dont think anyone gave us a chance to play the game like we did against the european champions lets not forget about that
3193487 nigeria might not be as technical as the dutch but their athleticism and the quality of players that they have is pretty good
3193488 were definitely looking out for them and i obviously think its going to be a tough game for us to win but we thought that about sunday as well
3193489 freddy and michael will not play but as ive said from the beginning its all about the group
3193490 the 18 players weve chosen have to be up to the challenge
3193491 we cant continue to perform this way late in the game
3193492 we have to make some adjustments i have to figure out what i have and who is willing to step up in those roles
3193493 if you guys think this bullpen is bad go follow some other teams around and see what you come up with
3193494 ill tell you what id rather practice any day than push them sleds all day
3193495 oh yes man i dont care im a starter in my heart and im going to do everything i can to get there
3193496 any time you miss two weeks of camp you miss development and timing right now mines is a little off at least now were practicing so all i can do is get better
3193497 i need to chip off some rust i felt like today i was not as quick as i want to be because my timing
3193498 im going to lose a little bit more just because i feel like it will help me move quicker and be able to get out in front of these fast halfbacks weve got
3193499 they had seven penalties by rookies and that usually goes hand in hand with young players but i liked their effort i liked the way they played and they keep on getting better and better
3193500 i love the way they pass protected for the majority of the game and its very good for your first outing
3193501 high ankle sprains you dont know sometimes theyre worse than a broken ankle other times theyre back in a couple weeks
3193502 i felt like i could get up and walk off the field just fine but listening to our doctors and trainer they said it was just best to go to the hospital and get it checked out
3193503 everybody wants depth in the interior line and at the defensive end so im sure were not the only ones scouring the waiver wire for guys like that
3193504 if i could be out there today id be out there today
3193505 but its one of those things where you dont want to come back too fast because it could sideline you for even a couple more weeks
3193506 were going to miss heath farwell theres no doubt about that
3193507 he was a tremendous player for us he had one of the best years ive seen a special teams player have a year ago
3193508 theyre going through all that as a team trying to figure out if favre or aaron rodgers was the man while weve got the same team we had all offseason im glad they got all that darn press cause when we go down there itll be the kids first start and his first damn loss
3193509 playing green bay on monday night to start the season thats everything you want
3193510 hopefully i can put my helmet square in the back of his spine if i can do that and knock the ball loose itll be a good day
3193511 they had a nice year last year but they dont understand that brett made those guys better than they were
3193512 he has the game all figured out and youve got to factor all that into the equation brett favre would throw the ball when the receivers hadnt even made their cut yet and it would be there waiting for them those guys had it good
3193513 people think its the system but it aint no damn system brett favre just knows where his guys are going to be at all times and i dont think has got that yet
3193514 i just wanted to say that your article about brett favre causing the divorce is a complete joke one of the worst biased stories ive ever read the green bay packers are easily the ones to blame and if you knew how to investigate the facts youd know that too the whole thing has been about green bay disrespecting the face of their franchise aaron rodgers doesnt even come close to comparing to his predecessor green bay has stuck by this unproven joke of a qb for whatever reason theyre trying to force favre to stay retired whether it be by bribing him with a 20 million marketing deal or threatening to sit him on the bench im not even a packers fan but even i know they should release him or start him youre clueless
3193515 ive been a packers fan since 1966 and while ive never been to a game ive learned many things about life through the lombardi packers legacy im physically handicapped and took to heart many of the principles that were the packers for many years ive admired brett but his lack of team spirit and his inability to forgive and move on as well as his attitude that he must get his way tells me he does not have what it takes to call himself a packer thats reserved for people that are champions in their heart
3193516 aaron rogers should pay you for all you do for him not for this article but for all the others and every chance you got to write about him john madden has favre and you have aaron
3193517 type what you will mr silver but plain and simple if mr farve wants to unretire then so be it honestly this just brings to mind what mr michael jordan went through
3193518 michael i just wanted to let you know that i am a big brett favre fan but i believe your article hit the nail on the head i think both sides had some fault to the situation but favre should carry the majority of the blame excellent job as i read several sports articles i find that yours are the most balanced and straight forward i appreciate that in the world of biased sports writers great job michael keep it up
3193519 mike expletive you no expletive you farve doesnt have to prove expletive to some expletive like you if the packers had any class theyd cut him or trade him your one dishonest expletive go expletive yourself i cant believe they pay you to write this expletive go expletive yourself expletive expletive
3193520 my questions is do you get paid for the pooh you put on this website blame favre you dont know half of the shizzle that went on before he announced his retirement you dont know what hes feeling what it must be like to know your last throw was a pick that cost the team a chance to go to the super bowl you just put your half cent into it and run with it well good for you hope youre happy when mr favre reads this his family will read this column and they will be hurt you meanie go packers
3193521 michael thank you for the article as you see im from the heartland of packerland and am disgusted that everyone is so blindly following this god that was once a great selfless football player but is now his own egos worst enemy the insane favre no matter what fans are driving myself and all of my family and friends in wisconsin nuts they need to open their eyes and see how brett has played the team and fans like a puppet the last 4 5 years and is now trying to stage his final act unfortunately for him the packers management has had enough and i am so proud of them for standing up to him and sticking its ground wake up brett i have loved to watch you play for many years but you do not walk on water this whole situation is like a bad car accident you try to look away but just cant please please let it end soon and let him move on way down in tampa bay aaron rodgers has a team that he is concerned about and needs to get ready for the season thanks again for the article you were right on point ive lived it for too many years and am no longer seeing favre thru rose colored glasses unfortunately the good times are getting clouded now
3193522 right on its about time somebody called favre on the carpet for his actions hes a baby and deanna is no angel here either she should shut her big yapper and steer clear of everything you wont be a guess on espn anytime soon because they are so in bed with athletes its scary by the way to me favre is one of the most overrated stars i have watched play sixteen seasons 2 2 in nfc championship games 1 1 in super bowls and 28 interceptions in 22 playoff games you can have him remember he has the same number of super bowl wins as and mark rypien big deal
3193523 michael i know youre getting emails right now from guys bashing skipping voluntary otas and wanting more than 6 million year then these guys will say that if someone paid them to play football theyd show up and like it and blah blah blah will you permit me to rebut in advance torry holt does not make 6 mil to play football he makes it because he sells tickets and popcorn and programs and big foam fingers and advertising time on tv and about 100 000 rams no 81 jerseys simply he earns big money because he generates big money for his employer the rams i am a regular working slob who will never make anywhere near what holt is making this year and this is totally fair if somehow the day comes that i generate for my company the amount of money holt generates for his you better believe i will stand up and demand my 6 million its called the free market and it works this is before i say anything about the life long physical damage he is doing to his body or fact that holts career will be many many years shorter than mine or any of that
3193524 let me start by saying your the best after being hooked on your column for about a year now i know what a stickler you are when it comes to grammar i know its youre just messing with you please go easy on me i somewhat suck at puncuation and i am also extremely emotional about brett as a jet i remember reading one of your stories last year about brett back when you liked him whats up with all the negativity i have noticed your past few stories on him all seem pretty harsh brett is the reason i love the game show the guy some love the guy loves the game nothing better than watching someone who loves the game as much as he does once again i apologize for any grammatical errors love the column just ease up on brett take care
3193525 what a surprise youre still hating on favre so did brett steal your girlfriend or what dont you have anything better to do than hate brett favre im not asking you to
3193526 a desperate move lets see favre was the nfcs second highest rated passer in 2007 the 95 7 mark his best in 11 years in leading the packers to a 13 3 regular season record and nfc title game appearance he passed for 4 155 yards and 28 tds not to mention runner up in mvp voting this as opposed to staying with the pea shooter losers who were the jets qb choices prior to this trade yeah that really sounds desperate on the other hand maybe you are just a complete retard lets go with that
3193527 silver ive got to say that i really appreciate that fact that you will go out on a limb and make statements that are a bit unpopular at times kudos my man you take a lot of cheap shots from some of our nations best and brightest every week yet you still maintain your sanity sense of humor and swagger long live yahoo sports and long live michael silver you are doing a great job
3193528 how do i get your daily column sent to my email every day youre the most insightful sports columnist that i have ever run across loved your insights on t o
3193529 i just wanted to say to all of the people who think you are some lackey writing a sports column on the internet this guy gets interviews with coaches owners players and now even performers not only does he get the interviews he has dinner with them and really gets to know them with saying that think before you write mr silver and tell him how stupid he is he is one of the best and most respected sportswriters in football he writes his stories and you get a feeling from it so much that it makes you write horribly misspelled e mails to him stating that he is dumb wow anyway mr silver if you are ever back in the valley of the sun i would love to do some julio shots with you you are the best
3193530 i think that everybody felt like it was a breakout year for him
3193531 this is a decisive year for me i guess im in a position i dont know what the organization is going to do ive got to go out there and do what ive always done which i dont think is a problem for me
3193532 i wont allow myself to fall into a comfort zone and feel like thats what it is and thats what its supposed to be so as a player the only thing i can control with that is how i play i go out and put my best foot forward every sunday as i have for the past eight years and everything will take care of itself
3193533 right now its august its football season im not concerned about anything like that
3193534 all im concerned about is is the team getting as far as we can during the regular season and playing into the postseason february march is where that stuff takes place then theres more to say this whole year theres nothing even to talk about
3193535 im thankful im able to come in and help complement him and learn from him i think we complement each other well on the field hes definitely one of those guys whos definitely been under the radar for a number of years
3193536 it started to come as the game went along but its those mental errors weve got to get rid of
3193537 i think it was a good learning experience for us
3193538 he was a big part of our offense last year and hes a very good player were missing him but we have to do what we have to do when hes not here
3193539 after two series its really hard to judge it was tough to get into a rhythm
3193540 mentally going into a game knowing youre only playing two series is really hard to play a football game that way
3193541 i think at the beginning i was more nervous but after a couple of series i was able to calm down
3193542 overall im satisfied with what i did as far as scoring a touchdown but not satisfied with my overall game
3193543 his ability to capture the moment was second to none
3193544 win or lose we had a great time every day
3193545 remarkable talent and a unique wit who had an unbridled joy for the
3193546 his impact on the braves can be characterized so simply braves won braves won braves won
3193547 finally starting to sort of feel good from the first hand injury then having the hand hurt again and being able to rehab through that and finally get to the point after six long weeks to be able to come through that
3193548 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
3193549 its disappointing for me too i thought he was going to be our deadline deal getting him back healthy in the middle of the order
3193550 that leaves us three weeks for the season to be able to help in some type of capacity
3193551 its going to be tough to replace his offense but its even tougher to replace the man
3193552 it was real big for these guys to really pull together and come back
3193553 especially 5 1 down and didnt look like anything was going our way at all
3193554 this is a fresh beginning thats the way im looking at it
3193555 now i just have to keep up what ive been doing

3193560 serbia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity should be respected
3193561 it was a good scrimmage but we still have a lot of work to do on both sides of the ball it did give us a lot of film on just about everyone so we can isolate on what we need to have corrected it will allow us to look at the offensive line and determine who are the best guards who are the best tackles etc chris hairston has done a good job at tackle he is our best tackle but cory lambert is closing the gap both are starters cory has made improvement over these 10 days coming out of the spring chris was by far our best tackle but cory is getting closer
3193562 andre powell has brought a lot of new things to the table as special teams coordinator he has done a good job in that area this is the first time i have had someone on my staff who was a special teams coordinator before he got here

3193582 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
3193583 it is kind of strange for a large predator like that to come that close to the house
3193584 an isolation tank is a lightless soundproof tank in which subjects float in salty water at skin temperature they were first used by john c lilly in 1954 in order to test the effects of sensory deprivation such tanks are now also used for meditation and relaxation and in alternative medicine
3193585 the film has travolta as an inventor and newton john as a bank teller it is up to both criminally minded individuals to save the earth from gods destruction this film was the antithesis of travoltas and previous film together
3193586 the end of the education is character education is for life and not just for a living
3193587 standing silently and waiting patiently for ones turn be it for a bath breakfast games or class and back well this disciplined routine itself is a great teacher
3193588 look at the mango tree you throw stones at it and yet in return it gives you delicious mangoes and as for the sandalwood tree it imparts fragrance even to the very axe that fells it see their spirit of sacrifice that is what we too should cultivate
3193589 so pain and suffering also have beneficial role on life
3193590 just as electrons exist unseen in all matter living or nonliving so does divinity exist unseen in all things
3193591 total harmony in the quality of thought word and deed
3193592 every candidate who has thought the youth vote would carry them to victory has lost physically going out and voting thats where youth have always dropped the ball
3193593 its important for youth not to underestimate their ability to change the direction of this election it looks like its going to be that close
3193594 you cant overestimate the importance of that particular kind of approach to engaging young people
3193595 the difference here is the arguments are not coming from a campaign or candidates they are coming from your peers
3193596 i think the question is going to be does that social networking approach translate into motivating young people to go out and vote on election day
3193597 i notice that many of my friends across the country use their pages to display their political values and beliefs
3193598 i also think it gets people excited about politics and young people who may not take time to read the usa today will watch a you tube or read a blog
3193599 were trying to energize who we have out there but a lot of young people arent going to vote
3193600 it seems like every couple of years they say its going to be the year of the youth vote and it hasnt been yet
3193601 id like to think people are more civilly engaged but its really that voter participation was so low that it had nowhere to go but up
3193602 with the magnitude of this presidential campaign im anticipating much more activity when school starts
3193603 the younger people are a little apathetic to united states politics but with it being such a historic year thats receiving so much media attention that apathy may be turning around
3193604 we are concerned that incumbent wireless carriers are seeking unnecessary and unprecedented testing delays to prevent new innovative competitors from entering the market
3193605 we are concerned that unnecessary interference testing would needlessly delay this auction and that this constitutes the very rationale to kill this effort totally we urge you to carefully consider the existing precedent before making your determination
3193606 for consumers the interference will be extensive widespread and unpredictable significantly degrading their service
3193607 in essence theyre gaming the system to make rules so that a new broadband competitor doesnt appear
3193608 any new entrant especially one that appeals to consumers because the price is disruptive is something they want to kill or delay
3193609 to have any relevance they have to stick to this
3193610 gard asks kagen to hold joint town halls on gas prices while congress is on five week summer break

3193612 consistency of coverage depth of info humor and quality of writing
3193613 although its tempting to sleep as late as possible during the remaining days of summer its not necessarily the best strategy for starting the school year off right

3193625 my dear friends what a horrible tragedy has befallen us
3193626 my dear friends we are gathered here to discuss and decide i hope how best to comfort josephs grieving parents and protect our community from another such tragedy the police have been called and they are searching for josephs
3193627 for the demon that committed such an evil act upon one of our children
3193628 the police are doing their part and theyve asked us to keep our children away from the house of course we will and i suggest that we also impose a curfew for them to give them a sense of order and safety
3193629 i agree with you father that a curfew would be good for our children but theres something else we need to do to ensure the future safety of our community as a whole
3193630 pray tell us eleanor what else can we do to prevent another tragedy
3193631 that is not for us to do the police would prohibit it im sure
3193632 its the house thats evil evil things happen in it if we destroy it then there will be no more evil
3193633 its because it has lain vacant for so many years it was vacant long before i was born
3193634 id like to discuss this further the idea of fixing up the house and selling it what say you all
3193635 thats a good point mrs parrish has that theres been no family living there for an awful long time
3193636 i am willing to renovate the house and sell it to a fine family but ill need help it has sat too long without any care and ill need for folks to volunteer their time at the first i would be very willing to work up a contract with the community council so that the folks who provide their labor will be properly compensated
3193637 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3193638 my lot only measures 31x66 feet correction 131x66 feet but all the free space we have occupied with the planting of vegetables fruits and a farmyard with hens goats bees and ducks
3193639 our crops are totally organic and we consume them my three children and i who also participate in this project we sell the fresh surplus produce to local restaurants as well as the edible flowers and decorative ones
3193640 at first we only grew vegetables and fruits for family consumption but when when i began to have a surplus i offered it to nearby restaurants
3193641 the saving of water and energy is another of our priorities for this i have adapted a small room that supplies hot water from the sun we take advantage of the waste water to water nearby plants also we have a toilet that works with the water from the water bowl installed above the tank
3193642 i imagine that they are a little surprised to see me with my goat and her leash as if it were a dog but i believe that they are getting used to it
3193643 she was asking us where we were all supposed to get off the bus and i told her this was our house
3193644 mom we went by the same things so many times and she kept saying she was lost i have no idea where all we were
3193645 my family is now being harassed and threatened she his wife is absolutely terrified and is afraid to leave the house or even go to work she is begging me to stop and i am going to listen to her i cannot endanger my family any further
3193646 i have updated this story now and now were going to move on because with or without techdudes report i stand by my assertion that the colb is fake and that is the bottom line as far as im concerned

3193653 all truth passes through 3 stages first it is ridiculed second it is violently opposed third it is accepted as self evident
3193654 for every finger one is pointing at you there are three fingers pointing back at them
3193655 solar powered you quote me in your reply and insinuate i said something untoward about techdude
3193656 one of my opinions would be techdude may be one of obamabotss operative hired by obamas compaign to discredit his bcs forgery

3193805 my read was that the westerners felt shame in those situations but they were inhibiting those responses and i think that is supported by the blind findings
3193806 in american and other western cultures were taught from a very early age not to show shame its stigmatized whereas in the east its appropriate to show shame in a major olympic failure for instance
3193807 with pride the original function may have been actually if i make myself larger that tells others im someone to watch out for

3193809 there are many times where its not that adaptive to show shame essentially youre saying i just screwed up
3193810 but if you really feel yourself weaker than an adversary and you could convey that that you agree youre more powerful than me i submit to you dont hurt me and we both save resources compared to if we had to fight my guess is thats why its still around
3193811 here are people who have never seen people express this
3193812 the only possible explanation you could make is well maybe their parents physically move their bodies in this way to teach them given the specificity of the response were not just talking about a simple arm stretch but chest expansion and shoulders pulling back and everything to me that seems like a less parsimonious suggestion than it being innate
3193813 primatologists have found that chimps show an inflated display when the alpha chimp is about to fight he puffs his shoulders and walks in a cocky gate
3193814 submission displays have been documented that involve cowering lowering of the body thats pretty similar to hunching the shoulders and the shame display but theres a difference between these anecdotal observations and an empirical study no ones coded a bunch of chimps and seen what are the exact behaviors you see in these situations

3193847 in recent years theres been a blurring of the lines between work and home and we need to recognize these shifting patterns of behaviour to meet our employees expectations we aim to be as flexible as possible as a company and part of this involves moving from a paternalistic to a more trusting policy when it comes to employee use of the web at work at the same time we have a duty of care towards our employees and must ensure that we secure our network and can block sites which are tasteless or offensive
3193848 before using blue coat we had a more blunt instrument of the block all allow all approach which didnt take into consideration the needs of different departments or regions likewise our av solution simply didnt have the capability to scan everything with blue coat we can now apply more finely tuned levels of policy across multiple web security services
3193849 we have to reflect this variety by applying flexibility in our policy controls and we can now fine tune our policies to meet these requirements
3193850 switching over to the blue coat appliances involved installing the new devices into our complex network environment this was facilitated by blue coats flexible architecture that allowed us to overcome many integration challenges
3193851 these features will also prove invaluable as we make increased use of web based applications and other tools such as video streaming without impacting on overall network performance

3193889 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century he said in his strongest condemnation yet of the fighting
3193890 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict he said

3194022 we had some guys show up and make some plays today but we have to go back and look at the film
3194023 both plays were slight improve plays by cody and me

3194029 it was an okay transition we made some mental mistakes and turned the ball over which is never good because those are what win and lose games that being said weve shown strides all camp were showing it in practice and we showed it today now we just have to become more consistent and create some more big plays to spark the team

3194103 and there are a lot of people we know who arent on these medications
3194104 however there are also people who get prescribed these medications and dont know why there is obviously appropriate use but there is inappropriate overuse and inappropriate underuse
3194105 im comfortable at this point with saying if youre only going to be on this medication a short time dont worry if youre going to be on it a long time the jurys still out as to what you should do

3194159 shes new i dont like her i think shes trying to sleep with jason and jasons just his love for sonny is so pure theres a reason they keep sleeping with the same girls because good god the brenda thing i mean seriously
3194160 when i say know i mean picked up at a bar
3194161 please stop trying to get me interested in general hospital its not going to happen american soap operas are pants
3194162 coming back and how can you resist the sonny goodness
3194163 there was this guy who was on passions i went out on a couple of dates with him fucking adonis not entirely bright but that wasnt why i was going out with him hey do you want to go somewhere tonight
3194164 all right i suppose you wouldnt believe me if i said orlando bloom before he was famous
3194165 no not really hes cute but not your type had you said sean bean id be like okay sure but orlando bloom
3194166 come on wes i dont care who you fucked what was it like an old star like jennifer beals or something
3194167 why who was your big name did you sleep with a sheen
3194168 youre the one obsessed with shagging the rich and famous
3194169 so if youre not a groupie why are you so damned elated about your mystery man or woman
3194170 well sort of a man i guess you could call justin a man
3194171 think of famous justins who arent yet men but arent really boys either
3194172 eager to please might be the best way to put it
3194173 two years ago nineteen he and i were both at this dreadful function in the hills for his label i was there hell i dont know who with
3194174 it was the lamest thing id been to in ages
3194175 so what you both got drunk and dissed the party outside
3194176 he made the pass at me not that i didnt set it up but still he asked if i wanted something to drink ms morgan and i most certainly did
3194177 so then what you ditched the party found a convenient coat closet
3194178 i was practically falling out of my dress he damn well did give me a ride all right right back to his hotel room
3194179 god the things that boy said in the back of the limo i actually think he used the phrase tap that ass which usually would have gotten him nowhere but i really wanted to have sex with justin timberlake
3194180 because then i could say i had sex with justin timberlake
3194181 so he told you all the wicked things he was going to do to you in the back of the limo how cliche
3194182 he kissed me and it was so sloppy but it was genuine
3194183 i suggested that it would be better if he tried something more subtle
3194184 its all about working your way up into a frenzy going for the slowww oh oh oh burn
3194185 he was so eager to please i could tell he wanted to just go at it in the limo but you know me
3194186 anyway so i taught him how to kiss and then we were at the hotel he made us go around back
3194187 you know youve got to be less skeptical why on earth would i try to impress you with this youre not a sixteen year old girl
3194188 and that would be about the only person whod care about that right
3194189 youre just jealous because the most famous person you screwed was that woman from general hospital
3194190 at least it wasnt passions like certain liars currently seated in my lap
3194191 im telling you we almost didnt make it to the hotel room
3194192 britney was apparently sleeping with someone else at the time but yo shes just she drives me crazy
3194193 i pushed him up against the wall and told him i didnt care about britney i just wanted him
3194194 he was whining i was not in it to hear a pop idol cry about how britney would take it up the ass and wow we were lucky his room was right there because he almost knocked me to the ground
3194195 so hotel room im wearing badgley mischa he tears it off me and apologizes he tells me ill pay for it but please is that okay if we and i step out of the dress and kick it halfway across the room then i walk up to him and im in a strapless bra and a thong and i start unbuttoning his shirt
3194196 so you were on your knees servicing a pop star in what the black lace number
3194197 i like the silver the black is better so mr timberlake clearly enjoyed fucking your mouth then what did you wait five minutes before he knocked you to the floor and fucked you with puppy like enthusiasm
3194198 i dont know why i bother with you youre such a motherfucker
3194199 i told him that was okay americas pop princess shouldnt have to swallow and then i told him it was time to show me if his tongue was as good as id heard or if that was just studio magic
3194200 that was manhood insulting you have noooo oh good god idea how far oh my god yes a man will go to prove his skills and seriously if you look up and say something i will beat your head in do not stop doing that
3194201 did he know how did you tell him what to do before getting bored with post adolescent fumbling did one of his brain dead band mates pound on the wall to tell you to shut the hell up
3194202 youre evading if you really had sex with mr timberlake then you wont stop telling now so youre at the mini bar and hes sorely wounded because youve mocked his ability to go down on a woman and then
3194203 and then i get a bag of m amp ms a glass of champagne sit down in the nicest hotel chair ive ever had the pleasure of sitting in and start looking for green m amp ms
3194204 and justin takes a deep breath walks across the room and the next thing i know hes got his head on top of my thighs and hes looking up at me like a schoolboy
3194205 theres a mrs robinson joke in there somewhere but ill be polite
3194206 what do you want he tells me that he knows how britney you know and yes of course i know britney shes not a girl but not yet a woman and i tell him while eating m amp ms with my knees just a little open and im honestly thinking about the two hours im going to end up spending at the gym the next day i say sweetheart thats well and good but i believe in reciprocation
3194207 maybe you can give me the spanking he owes me mmm
3194208 youre going to break my heart with this deeply sweet tale of corrupting young america
3194209 teaching the young how to fuck properly is the duty of every true american
3194210 i think half the reason its getting you worked up is because youve got an audience to hear about your petty escapades
3194211 you think its power you have getting a nineteen year old boy to fuck a beautiful woman ten years his also willing to put up his mistakes thats not every boys fantasy come to life and you let yourself be the fantasy for what the name
3194212 i knew what he wanted hell im lucky that once we finally hit that bed he didnt ask to call me mommy sweet little jup banged an older hottie who thought he could fuck so good and youre getting off on it because you have something to prove you can make the bad evil oh godohgodohgod woman spread wide for you all that power and ill give it up like that for you but do you want to know a secret wes
3194213 you think its hotter than hell that i fucked him
3194214 because you know its true that he wanted me so bad that he made a fool of himself
3194215 maybe not with the romantic intensity of a soap opera but then again who does
3194216 sometimes i dont know why i dont throw you out on your ear
3194217 and i woke up at six the next morning with a hangover
3194218 my three thousand dollar dress was ruined i felt like pamela des barres at a reunion concert and justin was drooling on the pillow snoring not the sexiest morning after of all time especially when i go into the bathroom to clean up and lance and chris walk in and start messing with justin while im trying not to hear lance bitchily tell justin that hes a skanky little manslut and hed never blah blah blah fuckin lance
3194219 did you keep lance bass out of space because that would be a terrible terrible thing to do
3194220 i wouldnt ever use my power and influence to do something so petty
3194221 he called me slutty otoole besides lance such a little queen he was just bitter about the part where hes not the one fucking justin
3194222 you denied a man his lifelong dream to go into space because he called you slutty otoole while you were in the shower
3194223 after you had a steamy one night stand with his nineteen year old friend and fellow pop idol two years ago
3194224 lance is evil im sure he would have done the same in my shoes
3194225 but i walk out in one of the giant fabulous bathrobes and smile at them oh im sorry im intruding justin honey could you get me my purse i need to call down to the concierge to get myself a cab and something to go home in lances jaw drops and chris is giving me the evil eye because i might have corrupted their sweet boy
3194226 he was such a gentleman unlike certain british assholes i fuck much much more often
3194227 he said his limo would take me anywhere and that wed find me an outfit just say the word and did i want breakfast
3194228 no id just get myself an orange juice and half a bagel on my way out
3194229 and theres not much more to tell after that i walked out of there with a dolce and gabbana t shirt that i think belonged to brit a pair of jcs jeans and chris undying hatred i gave justin my card wrote my cell phone number on the back kissed him on the cheek and thus ends the fairytale
3194230 so you never told me who your famous person was i know you had one this is los angeles fred durst hits on anything that moves and often succeeds youve got an accent and youre an attractive man youve done better than soap stars so tell
3194231 maybe some other time when im not overwhelmed by your prowess in seducing boyband members
3194232 not tonight dear im completely in awe of your exploits and wouldnt want to overshadow them

3194460 however im still mindful that we need to have a strong regional economy which will include green jobs
3194461 it is also vital to look at health education and family issues which are every bit as important as the environment
3194462 i think given the importance of environmental issues we now face we need to all come to the table as equals leave our bias at the door and sit down and work out exactly how to move forward and make bathurst a healthy productive and green region
3194463 thats long enough to demonstrate to you and others of like mind that this sort of thing simply wont do
3194464 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3194465 all quotes attributed to me on imao are made up including this one
3194466 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
3194467 does he have the experience necessary to send a text message
3194468 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy i was able to get a sense of his soul
3194469 we continue to turn out republican voters on election day at a higher rate and that is how we win elections
3194470 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

3194475 my baked bean tree has gone missing and i dont know why have you seen it anywhere
3194476 well no i havent have you been looking after it properly by weeding it regularly
3194477 why should i bother weeding around my tree im too busy thats far too much work
3194478 hello marmalade you dont look very happy what ever is the matter with you
3194479 im looking for my baked bean tree it seems to have gone missing and i dont know why i dont suppose that you have seen it anywhere
3194480 have you been feeding it plant food and fertilizer to keep it strong and healthy
3194481 why should i bother doing things like that its only a tree and besides trees are strong enough too look after themselves i dont have time to do that sort of thing thats far too much work

3194484 for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth
3194485 i mean i didnt realize you had all that information that anyone had all that information about us
3194486 information as possible in order to be able to support you as much as possible
3194487 i would like to understand what is happening what you are suggesting more fully as you rightly said we are new to this area
3194488 his school counselor what do you mean his school counselor
3194489 im sorry i dont understand are you telling me that my son has been in therapy here at the school
3194490 well with his teacher the counselor the prinicipal and myself
3194491 i dont understand my son you tell me is seeing a counselor here at the school discussions are taking place with you a social services representative the principal his teacher and no one up until this very moment thought i ought to know about it
3194492 well we thought that things were improving until the incident yesterday when your son hit the girl you know thats not acceptable behavior boys are much stronger than girls
3194493 wait a minute please we can discuss yesterdays incident in just a moment firstly however i would appreciate it if you would answer my question about all of this you see as the mother to my son i have been it would seem deliberately kept out of consultation about my sons behavior at school while a multitude of you were in discussion about him and apparently me as well is my understanding correct
3194494 normally when a child shows behavioral issues at school we try to deal with it within the school system with the facilities we have here we have highly trained members of the team who are accustomed to dealing with all manner of troubled behaviors
3194495 if it had not been for yesterdays incident then it is likely that this meeting would never have been called and the school year would have passed without you having to know
3194496 i see it seems as if you are almost as distressed as i am
3194497 mobileme members may be unable to access mobileme mail service will be restored asap we apologize for any inconvenience

3194510 but weve taken some steps here in the days weve been in pads which is good
3194511 theyre both still playing too high they had a few plays where they really looked like you want them to look it was a step in the right direction we basically have three starters right now and well have to continue to get those other guys pushed to the forefront

3194519 this measure will set a marketing code of conduct to help ensure health care providers make choices about prescription drugs and medical devices for their patients based on therapeutic benefits and cost effectiveness
3194520 i applaud the many important initiatives that this legislation enacts to enhance the quality and cost effectiveness of health care in the commonwealth
3194521 i have a lot of respect for the governor and i am proud that he did not bend to the pressure
3194522 i have never seen lobbying this intense they have been swarming the statehouse for weeks
3194523 the good news is that there are no more trips to the super bowl no more seminars in warm climates or 100 000 payments to people for ghostwriting pieces they did no work on
3194524 the governor also signed it without sending it back for any amendments if he had amended it since we are no longer in session that would effectively have killed it
3194525 maybe he might reply if readers of this blog would politely ask for his thoughts on the matter

3194527 what is clear is that the extremes have been strengthened
3194528 were in the same position as before the referendum but more polarized and with more profound differences
3194529 the national polarization has never been as clearly demarcated as now
3194530 that is the question that will define the immediate future
3194531 it is time to deepen in a democratic way the transformation of the nation
3194532 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3194533 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3194534 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3194535 yeah but he just makes me wanna sin bad but i do luv ya more
3194536 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3194537 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3194538 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3194539 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3194540 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3194541 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3194542 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3194543 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3194544 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3194545 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3194546 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3194547 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3194548 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3194549 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3194550 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3194551 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3194552 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3194553 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3194554 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3194555 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3194556 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3194557 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3194558 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3194559 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3194560 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3194561 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3194562 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3194563 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

3194565 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3194566 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3194567 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3194568 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3194569 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3194570 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3194571 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3194572 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3194573 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3194574 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3194575 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3194576 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3194577 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3194578 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3194579 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3194580 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3194581 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3194582 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3194583 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3194584 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3194585 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3194586 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3194587 our goal was to create a matrix that got people into profit faster than any other company in the industry and we feel we have done that
3194588 at work listening to the radio i heard becky aldington win then looked up to see it best of luck to all athletes today and cmon the brits
3194589 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3194590 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3194591 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3194592 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3194593 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3194594 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3194595 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3194596 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3194597 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3194598 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3194599 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3194600 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3194601 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3194602 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are

3194618 it says white tea foaming milk bath i am not allergic to any of those things
3194619 self what would be the least citrusy type of bubble bath the one that says white tea foaming milk bath yeah that sounds like it wouldnt have any citrus in it at all
3194620 its not for the point of the stunt or novelty its to make a statement about wastefulness
3194621 if someone were to send us one million empty bottles we would welcome the opportunity to recycle them

3194627 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3194628 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3194629 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3194630 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3194631 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3194632 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3194633 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3194634 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3194635 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3194649 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3194650 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3194651 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3194652 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3194653 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3194654 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3194655 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for

3194669 these changes take unbiased professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees

3194674 blake made a phone call which i agree was unusual and the timing was strange that tells me that they were under stress and under pressure
3194675 i have seen them around the village and they have looked very calm but i am sure that can happen with the pressure of the event they will learn from this and that is the most important thing
3194676 tom is a remarkable kid no question but this was a good lesson because it puts things in perspective for them we have talked to tom and he has said yes he was nervous and blake when he missed the third dive picked up on that and his body language changed
3194677 hes just 14 so a little more space would be good and he needs to go back to school
3194678 we have not looked at the numbers but there was some funny judging going on out there we dont look at the individuals but there was one dive where tom had 5 5 and 7 5 from the two judges which is a big discrepancy
3194679 actually the synchronisation was really good it was the execution of the dives that let them down when that happens the synchronisation slips
3194680 can we go from that bit and make it really quiet
3194681 what do you actually do couldnt the orchestra do it without you

3194697 dalam buku tersebut dia mengaku bahwa dia datang ke jakarta pada tahun 1945 setelah melarikan diri dari blitar kemudian ikut sidang bpupki sebagai orang yang membawakan tas bung karno apa waktu itu soekarno bawa tas
3194698 sedangkan kita tahu dalam sejarah yang menaikkan bendera itu latif hendradiningrat pejuang peta dan seorang anak muda bernama suhud apakah suhud yang berubah nama menjadi andaryoko

3194703 i really didnt know he won until he came back yesterday and asked me to scan his ticket check it
3194704 i checked it and it came back with a number for him to call and he went and called it and came back yesterday and told us he was a millionaire
3194705 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3194706 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3194707 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3194708 its hard to put that kind of race behind you
3194709 but it sets me up for something good the 200 free final thats my first priority
3194710 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3194711 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane it doesnt matter where you are
3194712 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there
3194713 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3194714 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3194715 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
3194716 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind from ahead it doesnt matter
3194717 he was just a part of it and we were a part of it whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3194718 lets hurry and clean the house and we can go to the circus tomorrow
3194719 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3194720 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3194721 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3194722 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3194723 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3194724 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3194725 if i had more money i would have stayed and never gone back
3194726 we hear from other returnees that they had regret going back because there is still bombing kidnapping and killing
3194727 god willing the flights will continue in order to fetch all families that wish to come back we welcome all our citizens who want to come home
3194728 some iraqis are choosing to return because the situation has improved in their areas but many others find themselves under many pressures in the host countries as their savings and resources have been exhausted
3194729 im concerned that i will not be able go out freely whenever and wherever i want like i used to do in egypt
3194730 i dont know how we are going to cope with our new lives it is going to be hard with no security electricity or enough drinkable water
3194731 it is of our duty to rebuild our country and to help rid it of sectarianism
3194732 look at the double standards of this government it did not help us during all the bad times in exile but when it came to its own political gains they sent a plane to get us back probably to our death
3194733 marley and me life and love with the worlds worst dog
3194734 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3194735 a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit
3194736 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3194737 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3194738 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3194739 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3194740 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3194741 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3194742 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently
3194743 weve been challenged at the newsstand recently which is an industry wide trend and the decline pretty much mirrors where we are vis a vis our competitors
3194744 it feels to me just like a natural step for us to take
3194745 its always exciting to shake things up a bit and to grow and to do things differently

3194748 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3194749 we should move ahead with the resolution despite russian veto threats and submit russia to the court of world public opinion
3194750 whatever tensions and hostilities might have existed between georgians and ossetians they in no way justify moscows path of violent aggression
3194751 the discussions between the two parties were frank and positive
3194752 they discussed the progress made by iraq and especially that of the iraqi governments success in security and the future reconstruction projects
3194753 will open a new page in relations between the two countries which will help to maintain the stability and security in iraq and all the region
3194754 is ready to stand at the side of iraq to realize the wish of the iraqi people for security stability and prosperity
3194755 my attitude is is if youve got relations with mr bashir think about helping to solve the humanitarian crisis in darfur that was my message to the chinese government
3194756 and our team is fired up and so am i im excited to be here its such a thrill to watch our men and women compete
3194757 and their response was thanks for coming we are really really honored to represent america and i was impressed by them and of course they go out and put on a great performance
3194758 alexis stewart said in an interview that the sometimes harsh opinions nothing is off limits including her mothers clothes fastidiousness and habit of mixing sexual innuendo with her household hints is simply the truth

3194761 thats what the democrats did in the 2006 election they just talked about change and a new direction and they didnt really say much about anything else
3194762 you must be releasing estrogen or some other chemical thats beguiling me
3194763 the government will be able to legislate on the first stage in the next 12 to 18 months
3194764 the second stage of the response will consider the remaining recommendations including those relating to exemptions from the privacy act and data breach notifications
3194765 the initial determination of whether there is a risk of harm to an individual will be done by the agency or the organisation
3194766 if you get a situation where there hasnt been notification and it does become public then im sure the privacy commissioner and others are going to be looking at this and asking why you didnt notify
3194767 at a talk that was given by sandi hardmeier who was the head of security for microsoft she said there is no system in the world that has been built that cant be hacked into it may be a one off situation that doesnt indicate the organisation is treating information willy nilly
3194768 they shouldnt require a large investment in technology to comply with what theyre recommending at this point all that is being recommended is that your systems are being monitored and that you can identify breaches and records of those affected by breaches
3194769 every financial services organisation does this as a part of the normal course of business that is monitor and know whats occurring on their systems
3194770 retailers are well monitored in terms of their back end systems the front end systems however which have been involved in huge debacles like tjx still have issues there but thats more about insufficient practices than insufficient technologies
3194771 it will be the result of either a mistake or done out of curiosity by an employee
3194772 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
3194773 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the in 1985
3194774 one thing we are certain of this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
3194775 they just disappeared he just noticed at some point that they werent there any more he didnt think much of of it because he hardly knew them
3194776 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3194777 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3194778 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between and distant observations of impacts on species
3194779 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3194780 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3194781 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3194782 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3194783 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3194784 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3194785 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3194786 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3194787 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3194788 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3194789 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision

3194791 es verdad que los waraos se mueren pero de diarrea y de hambre porque no tienen una planta de tratamiento de agua potable y no tienen qu comer porque en esa zona no hay trabajo
3194792 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3194793 a few of these guys is going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3194794 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3194795 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3194796 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3194797 its non displaced which is good news as were looking at it now we dont think it will be too long after that two week period
3194798 whether its three weeks or a little bit sooner than that or a little bit later im not sure
3194799 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3194800 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3194801 love for a mother is a strong motive not to tell police about a murder

3194810 one quarter of speculative grade issues now yield 1000 basis point above treasuries a year ago it was zero
3194811 companies that were stressed on their balance sheets to begin with are now seeing lower top line growth and then seeing their margins squeezed
3194812 they predicated balance sheet strategy on assumptions of continued growth and stable to improving margins
3194813 one half of what has defaulted in the u s is private equity lbo related
3194814 default rates could spike next year beyond that 8 rate

3194818 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3194819 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community
3194820 washingtons bloody fingerprints are all over the invasion of south ossetia georgia president mikhail saakashvili would never dream of launching a massive military attack unless he got explicit orders from his bosses at 1600 pennsylvania ave
3194821 exuberant support of the united states for president mikheil saakashvili of georgia a figure loathed by the kremlin on both personal and political terms
3194822 other diplomats worried that both mr saakashvilis persona and his platforms presented an implicit challenge to the kremlin and that mr saakashvili made himself a symbol of something else russias suspicion about american intentions in the kremlins old empire they worried that he would draw the united states and russia into arguments that the united states did not want this feeling was especially true among russian specialists who said that whatever the merits of mr saakashvilis positions his impulsiveness and nationalism sometimes outstripped his common sense the risks were intensified by the fact that the united states did not merely encourage georgias young democracy it helped militarize the weak georgian state

3194826 the study has a very pro exercise message if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3194827 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3194828 this research re confirms the clear benefits of regular exercise for older people
3194829 exercise can help older people to stay mobile and independent ensure a healthy heart keep weight and stress levels under control and promote better sleep

3194832 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
3194833 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
3194834 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
3194835 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
3194836 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
3194837 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
3194838 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
3194839 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
3194840 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3194841 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3194842 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3194843 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3194844 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3194845 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3194846 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3194847 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3194848 the kosovo precedent has driven us to more actively seek our rights
3194849 from 2 500 to 3 000 mercenaries fight against russias peacekeepers on behalf of georgia
3194850 if it wasnt for financial aid i dont think i would be at san diego state because i come from a low income family
3194851 i had to take out a loan i dont want my parents to have to take out a loan with their financial situation
3194852 i want to be a teacher and i know with the current budget teachers are being laid off what if i cant get a job and i have to pay back my loan
3194853 we had a very strong job market in the last few year where people would come out and have multiple offers
3194854 it may take them longer and not get into what they want to do initially
3194855 they may not go for the job of their career instead the job that will provide them basic benefits like health care
3194856 now a 75 gap between cigarette sales in the city and cigarette consumption
3194857 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values

3194859 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3194860 i wandered onto the total chaos of the movie set people were running around everywhere adjusting things and looking for people tucker walked by me without even noticing that i was there focused on yelling at someone in front of him
3194861 ive seen this twice today scares the bejesus out of me twitter is fun but gmail is mission critical
3194862 pedro did everything we could ask of him given the stage of his career hes in
3194863 you score three in the first you expect to win
3194864 you lead by four in the sixth youre supposed to win
3194865 there have been some names in the paper one in particular that i can unequivocally tell you that i have not made one single phone call toward that particular player
3194866 i dont know where that came from because i dont believe that particular player would be a good fit for us
3194867 we need 25 guys to play good every day to win this thing
3194868 you start looking at names that really dont necessary fit the equation and you never want to do that
3194869 a lot of names out there that are veteran type guys that would on the surface appease everyone and say we have that spot covered but we know it wont work our in house candidates would be better served than an outside choice because weve trained them to be able to pitch in this ballpark
3194870 sometimes the most obvious move isnt so obvious for us
3194871 in essence if we dont really believe that will translate into success in this ballpark and thats very key then it doesnt make sense to do it
3194872 so the most obvious moves sometimes to the public isnt the most obvious in all of our research and what weve done to determine what is successful here in this ballpark

3194884 his family have a very strong support unit but all of them are just incredibly shocked
3194885 and just really really looking to find out more so that way we can begin planning to celebrate lees life in the correct way
3194886 theyre having a memorial in sydney but were hoping to get lees body flown to the uk to bury him here
3194887 he ran regularly it was part of his training for football
3194888 shes got a good family and friends supporting her but obviously shes very much in shock
3194889 i believe they were just about to move in together
3194890 he would have a drink occasionally at a party but i should imagine that if he was doing something like a run he would have stayed in with michelle the night before
3194891 its just a terrible shame he was a wonderful individual who is going to be greatly missed
3194892 he was such a fantastic amazing caring fun loving person
3194893 he made everyone laugh and lived his life to the full

3194897 we are still confident the constellation program will make its first flight to the international space station on or before that date
3194898 we had many difficulties i do not like complaining but sometimes there are obstacles you can not overcome that you and your team have to face what everyone cares about is the final result we all know this so we dont explain
3194899 a few things for those going to springfield 1 if you are in springfield my birthplace but thats

3194904 we dont believe the puppies attacked him but the puppies were using him as a food source due to the fact that they just didnt know any better and he was on the ground incapacitated for a couple of days
3194905 hes incapacitated and needs full time care and should have had full time care and some of the medicines and treatments were not getting to him
3194906 i didnt get along with my dad real well i could never imagine treating him like that in his last days
3194907 that just blew me away i couldnt believe it that was going on right next to me
3194908 there has been a confluence of factors including recalls and litigation that resulted in the companys loss in 2007 the first for the company in its storied 40 year history
3194909 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3194910 a magnificent tribute to the athletes and the olympic spirit
3194911 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route

3194918 russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict

3194932 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3194933 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3194934 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3194935 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3194936 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3194937 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3194938 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3195035 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel

3195063 tom was very very nervous more than ever before and i think he really struggled to get through the competition
3195064 and for me to be his partner it was hard for me to get up there and ease him into his competition unfortunately its a partnership and you both have to be on top of your game i was on top of my game but tom was nowhere near the top of his game
3195065 i outdived tom and thats not normally something that happens its because tom had a lot more pressure on him than me
3195066 i knew we were capable of a medal but i knew going into this tournament it would depend on how tom performed
3195067 i dont see how tom let the side down at all he was bound to be nervous he is 14
3195068 neither of them dived their best but nobody made mistakes it sounds like sour grapes to me rather than taking it on the chin as he should
3195069 this was blakes only competition and the games are finished for him i just hope he doesnt upset tom because he has another competition to deal with in 11 days if he does he will have me to deal with

3195124 it is realized that the league is incapable of rendering material aid and that the moral influence which may be a powerful force with civilized countries is unlikely to make any impression upon soviet russia
3195125 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
3195126 the situation in georgia is very difficult because russia is doing everything possible to occupy the country

3195147 it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no god it neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg
3195148 if i could write like this i would be a happy man
3195149 his european perspective on american liberty often catches me off guard but i am never sorry when i read his site
3195150 mercilessly skewers the idiocy of the nanny state with a wry sense of humor that makes it a daily must read
3195151 i can see why it would be attractive but on the flip side you cant be naive about it
3195152 you have to feel really confident that if something goes haywire you can get your money back
3195153 what do you do for people who cant afford the bulbs
3195154 this position gives me a lot more opportunities to effect change
3195155 a lot is going to happen with the changes in the administration next year there will be climate change legislation and i want to be part of that
3195156 im about trying to effect positive change and not running around saying the sky is falling
3195157 i think we can do a lot with the momentum that is building
3195158 and weve been contacted by a lot of groups who want to do similar efforts people feel they have to do something
3195159 but its cool to see the momentum being built and its fun to meet so many different people
3195160 raises questions on the return on investment but its a work in progress
3195161 i am pleased to see that our friends at the rhode island department of revenue have created this work in progress discussion paper
3195162 when analyzing the overall impact upon our state and our citizens one must consider the direct and indirect returns as well as the multiplier effect and future positive economic impacts including the need to attract new resilient and innovative industry and high paying employment to a state that is currently losing jobs at an alarming rate
3195163 on average every dollar invested by the state in the form of a motion picture production tax credit has returned 28 cents to the state
3195164 direct and indirect expenditures for the state to earn back the value of the tax credits issued
3195165 the analysis proves that subsidies for motion picture production are a bad investment of state funds and suggests that the only movie credits that are meaningful are the ones rolling at the end of the film
3195166 in these extraordinary tough fiscal times limited state resources should be invested in proven economic development strategies like work force training
3195167 additional tax revenue will be generated by ancillary economic activity associated with film production in massachusetts and by multiplier effects entailed by this related economic activity
3195168 since the advent of silent film and the birth of hollywood in the early 20th century the motion picture business has brought economic and cultural benefits to the states and communities that host projects of all sizes
3195169 we took some of the concept art but the game design assets and engine are 100 percent cryptic

3195171 i wanted to put the jurors in the victims shoes
3195172 i didnt want to be over the top but i wanted to be effective those words are important because i have to show criminal intent those words show criminal intent
3195173 she really put her heart and soul into this case and that really shined through the jurors responded to what she had to say
3195174 she gets her point across and she does it well i thought she handled herself very well
3195175 we very much believe in what we were doing with mythos creating a fast paced mmo in the diablo mold that brought together socialization and visceral fun combat
3195176 our testers response was great and we think theres really a place in the market for what we were doing even with diablo iii on the horizon we really want to get there again
3195177 at present were proceeding under the assumption that continuing with mythos wont be possible for us
3195178 there are some enormous obstacles to making that a reality
3195179 the future of the ip and technology are in question and in cases like this as engineers drift away it becomes increasingly difficult to make use of whats come before
3195180 were fortunate enough to have our entire mythos team on board for runic but the good folks from ping0 who were responsible for the network back end have begun to find employment elsewhere so that door really does seem to be closing
3195181 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it

3195188 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3195189 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3195190 they can do what they want with it but he doesnt remember anything he remembers nothing before 1993 except for little bits and pieces

3195204 this fight is about 70 000 people who feel more affinity to russia than they do for the breakaway state
3195205 its not the sort of fight that raises major issue for the u s and its not in a strategic location to warrant our deeper involvement
3195206 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point

3195225 traditionally wikis have centered on paragraphs of text and have proven invaluable for dealing with information in that form
3195226 i am thrilled at how we have been able to bring spreadsheet editing into the wiki environment business people get the familiar layout formatting and calculation functionality of a spreadsheet together with the organic multi page building and sharing functionality of a wiki the spreadsheet metaphor has proven to be one of the most popular ways to organize analyze and store a vast range of types of information with the addition of socialcalc socialtext now has an even more powerful tool to let groups develop and keep track of their important data and ideas

3195235 i certainly would support no hope for ever getting out of prison
3195236 they deserve to get the death penalty but they also deserve to spend some time thinking about what theyve done
3195237 thats worse than death every day youve got to think about what you did to that girl

3195247 we believe that we need to feel united on this torturous path that has cost so many lives
3195248 are you really going to run with this s t
3195249 i think the biggest thing was embracing technology and owning it and making it our own at the
3195250 so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3195251 i talked to some folks at sony but they were not interested in carrying the game later on i talked to someone from a different division who was interested but by then i had signed with microsoft and started the xbla port
3195252 its a limited exclusive so if i were to try to make a ps3 or wiiware version of the game i would have to wait a little bit
3195253 of course it is also worth noting that the churchs twisted ideas on sexuality also create a culture of endemic perversion
3195254 techskeptics original comment had the feel of an attack on dawkin but his further explanation makes it clear it was no such thing
3195255 i dont think ive ever seen you write like that no links nothing to back up these assertions
3195256 the original premise was right religion certainly doesnt prevent bizzare or immoral behavior to say it causes it is an entirely different thing and i doubt very much that this claim can be backed up i fully welcome efforts to prove me wrong im not making the claim
3195257 i can quite clearly hear a serious heart murmur do you drink

3195384 at the end of the day you can play the what if game endlessly and you can play both ways you know if senator clinton hadnt gotten teary eyed in new hampshire i think senator obama would have won new hampshire and he would have been the nominee in january so there are a thousand different ways you can play the what if game but i do believe that the result would have been different had this become public a year ago

3195408 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3195409 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3195410 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3195411 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3195412 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3195413 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3195414 it is a very grim situation and a dangerous one this russian invasion recalls variously the invasion of afghanistan 1978 the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and soviet invasion of georgia in 1922

3195429 over the last week i have heard loud and clear that central floridians want a comprehensive energy plan that lowers energy prices today and maps out a plan for americas future to remove our dependence on foreign oil
3195430 last week i urged my constituents to mail me their gas receipts and flood nancy pelosis voicemail to insist that she allow an up or down vote on that provides a comprehensive plan to unleash all of americas energy resources since she is still on her dismal book tour ignoring the calls from hardworking americans to address rising gas prices i plan to return immediately to the capitol to promote my energy action plan whenever liberals decide they are willing to vote on a plan for american energy american businesses american workers and american families i will be there
3195431 the commerce departments favorable decision helped to secure the jobs of 150 hoosier workers at gleason and it should bring hope to countless other american workers whose jobs are threatened by the illegal trade policies of china
3195432 there is no question that hoosier manufacturers can compete in a global economy but it is impossible to succeed when the competition is allowed to break the rules
3195433 i hope todays events at gleason will serve as a symbolic
3195434 we are very grateful to congressman souder for his work on our behalf
3195435 we hope that other manufacturers will be encouraged to take action in their own markets to help establish fair honest trade practices for all american manufacturers

3195441 weve got five kennedys here who have truly been inspiring public leaders and public servants to the people of cape cod
3195442 he chose to be in the pacific when most of his peers went off to postings in north america europe and asia
3195443 he is well read and the most conscientious sensitive and meticulous senior diplomat in our region i have had the privilege of working with during his term as sg
3195444 i doubt whether others would ever emulate let alone fill the very large shoes that he leaves behind with his resignation on medical grounds
3195445 in short i can describe his achievements as carvings on stone they last forever
3195446 he was a great role model for a young diplomat
3195447 i will deeply miss his wise counsel his company and his friendship greg will nevertheless continue to serve as an inspiration for those working in and for the region
3195448 his legacy will be twofold first a sense of the possibilities that exist in relations between australia and the countries of the region and second a vision of our region as a peaceful prosperous and proud community of nations working together for the common good
3195449 mr urwin has a passion for history and politics and has always read widely in both fields
3195450 this interest has stood him in good stead throughout his career not least during his tenure as forum secretary general when the region faced a range of difficult political challenges
3195451 he helped to enhance the forums international standing on the world stage
3195452 he is the least pretentious of leaders and quickly puts others at ease
3195453 in our view he made time to hear the concerns of ngos but it did not end there as he certainly facilitated more formal spaces for future dialogue between ngos and forum officials and governments
3195454 his constant advice to us was that the path to more formal and comprehensive engagement of ngos in forum processes would be a work in progress and done incrementally and needed the endorsement of all 16 forum member governments and budgetary support
3195455 issues have been raised by counsel on ms banwaris evidence given in court yesterday the state now has to disclose the entire statement to defence counsel so in all fairness i have to give the defence lawyer some time to analyse the document

3195462 our family doctor in the little village outside munich where i grew up was a homoeopath my mother swore by it as a kid i was treated homoeopathically so this kind of medicine just came naturally even during my studies i pursued other things like massage therapy and acupuncture
3195463 as a young doctor i had an appointment in a homoeopathic hospital and i was very impressed with its success rate my boss told me that much of this success came from discontinuing mainstream medication this made a big impression on me

3195526 its only at the very end in 2005 that truthers became more vocal they just woke up one morning and decided to take this on as an issue
3195527 now theres a new version for the screen conspiracies have become big business
3195528 big explosion blew us he and nyc corporation counsel michael hess back into the 8th floor
3195529 there was an eerie sound the whole building went dark and the staircase that i was standing on just gave way
3195530 the firefighter who took us down kept saying do not look down and i kept saying why and were stepping over people and you know you can feel when youre stepping over people
3195531 and they made that decision to pull uh and we watched the building collapse
3195532 they made that decision to pull the rescue workers out of the area just in time because not long after we watched the building collapse
3195533 i ask every viewer to come to their own conclusion about the language larrys using
3195534 the scale of the conspiracy has grown to include not just the government and foreign intelligence but police fire service and even the media
3195535 since 9 11 mark loizeaux and his company controlled demolition inc have been the subject of a hate campaign and even accused sic of mass murder
3195536 but i think there are ways to handle it and ways that you dont handle it and you certainly dont terrorize terrorize people like the good folks that work here and family members
3195537 mark loizeaux is not unbiased he doesnt want to lose his top clients
3195538 it was very upsetting about a year ago because of the level of persecution and the virulence in which i was spoken about
3195539 its just very unfortunate that this whole rather ridiculous situation has grown out of whats really a very small and very honest mistake
3195540 we dont need to ask permission from the owner no
3195541 thats why i would know that there is no conspiracy cause for me to be a part of that would be obscene and it disgusts me to even think of it
3195542 this is it were dead were not gonna make it out of here the landing that we were standing on gave way i was left there hanging we were trapped on the eighth floor with smoke thick smoke all around us after the big explosion
3195543 this is some of the only footage of the south face of wtc 7
3195544 and the abc news video shows the whole side engulfed in smoke
3195545 were looking at the upper floors of tower 7 you could see columns gone floors collapsed heavy smoke coming out and fire the upper floors were an inferno
3195546 the main fires were concentrated on floors six through to thirteen there were fires initially on some of the upper floors
3195547 i think 9 11 skeptics have no respect for all the people that died that day its like a slap in their face
3195548 ive heard people talk about it that come from cincinnati and california i was here you werent
3195549 truthers had a big head start when i got involved in this in april of 2006 there were already over a million pages on the internet devoted to 9 11 conspiracy theories
3195550 there is simply no evidence that you could show them that theyre wrong
3195551 the entire game with them is picking little anomalies out but not connecting them in any coherent way
3195552 theres no coherent hypothesis and we keep asking for one
3195553 9 11 skeptics dont understand government and clearly have never worked in government
3195554 will tell you two things the government doesnt have the competence for a large scale conspiracy and number two it cant maintain secrecy
3195555 wtc 7 had a lot of security there was always police officers and undercover cops out front it was very very heavily guarded
3195556 could one use a controlled demolition on any building sure did it happen to wtc 7 on 9 11 no it did not
3195557 i dont care what kind of fucking experience he has man you honestly think richard clarke is going to come out and say oh yeah of course the government was a part of it oh yeah of course there was a cover up no hes going to toe the fucking party line hes going to defend his ex bosses cmon man

3195559 mccain saw us excused himself and we three went to the senate dining room for lunch
3195560 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
3195561 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the cap was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats such as far left udall and far right goldwater since its inception
3195562 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
3195563 there are a few states that try to increase revenue this way and they give us all a bad name
3195564 were a very mobile society evert time you move mail goes astray
3195565 thats something thats definitely there for me to see and get me motivated and more excited
3195566 i like to have little quotes and goals stuck up around the house as a personal reminder of what im working towards
3195567 i have them stuck up in the bedroom and in the study so i can see them every day when i look at them i can go ok thats what im working towards and ive got to keep working towards those things
3195568 my favourite quote is they never said it would be easy they just said it would be worth it they are just little reminders so that if you are hurting a bit that day you can pick yourself up
3195569 i feel like im getting motivated by people my age telling me how im motivating them
3195570 im inspired by all the people calling me and telling me their stories im getting pumped up about it
3195571 i was surprised at my reaction they gave me motivation and energy to do well this year they took winning in front of our home crowd away from us and we want our revenge
3195572 my love for the sport and my determination to achieve my objectives kept me going
3195573 when i was in primary school i really enjoyed swimming
3195574 she wasnt back at a new task yet so she wanted to come with me and i love it
3195575 her performance in march april and may to june 3 was literally miraculous
3195576 im very grateful actually personally that i had a chance to get out and see so much of america because her only option after she lost all those caucuses in february and knew she was going to be outspent was to raise this incredible grassroots campaign and chelsea made 450 appearances for her mother in the last three months alone i went to 350 different communities i got to see parts of america i never saw when i was running or serving and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life
3195577 my whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that india and china are about to pass the us in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change
3195578 i think it is really important that the vast mass of countries that are developing find ways to skip the carbon stage of economic development ways that accelerate rather than undermine their wellbeing
3195579 i think that the united states does need to pass climate change legislation we need to put a price on carbon we need to set up a capping trade system and one that cant be cheated on i agree with all that but when people say that most loudly they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing your grandchildren wont be proud of you and we may have an irreversible situation
3195580 secondly because all these developing countries have to be worried about the problems at hand feeding the people that are there educating them providing basic healthcare having some near term economic strategy i think that people like me who care about this stuff have to find economically attractive options for them
3195581 some former communist countries that prior to 1990 were running very very dirty carbon based inefficient industrial economies
3195582 the biggest problem with kyoto was the united states bugged out on it so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath
3195583 im not a government and i dont have access to vast amounts of money and im frustrated that even when the democrats are in we still havent given a tax credit for example for wind energy that goes more than three years
3195584 i just try to figure it out and i try to get other smart people around who figure out how to do this because i was so struck by all these countries that wont meet their kyoto targets
3195585 one reason i went to that little village today is that that little village is now organised for tomorrow ill go home now and ill be able to tell people that i went to the highlands of ethiopia and saw a classroom with two led lights nobody will believe that and that it works economically for them
3195586 i just want very much the country to change course
3195587 i want us to be on a different economic course a different social policy course a different course in the world and were going to do what we can to be helpful
3195588 look what we were doing was working so you had to assume there was going to be some blow back

3195627 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3195628 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades

3195632 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3195633 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3195634 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3195635 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3195636 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3195637 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3195638 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3195639 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

3195656 most of the guys i dated were captivated by my heart but they had different ways of trying to get to me
3195657 oh i bought this 17 game for my 13 year old boy and now i found out that you can watch pixel sex this game is not for kids and kids should see sex in the game
3195658 a custom engine so no rage or euphoria and new characters
3195659 this is a game that will deliver a rich fast paced and intense grand theft auto experience that will be truly unique to nintendos handheld platform

3195662 our integrated approach to offering a tailored mix of health safety and environmental programs along with esis world class service can help clients reduce workplace exposure hazards recognizing that clients need more flexibility and greater control over their risk management programs and ultimately their overall operations the end result of esis approach is that it translates into better management of hse costs
3195663 the loss of local fishing boats will also mean no revenue will remain in the country as all proceeds will be taken abroad by fishing boats fishing within fiji waters but are offshore based
3195664 and this we describe as a total irresponsibility by the government for paying no attention at all instead they prefer to sit by and watch this industry go down
3195665 we have been expecting a concrete decision to be taken by cabinet to save the fishing industry for the past 5 years to date we have received no response no fax no phone call no request no communication at all from the government or the ministry of finance for a discussion
3195666 as it is now we have six boats in the domestic fleet and in a few weeks it will be down to 4
3195667 we have been desperately trying to hold the industry together because we have in excess of experienced captains engineers and crews and these people are still on the payroll
3195668 we lay off these experienced workers who have had more than 20 years of tuna training they will be gone forever and so will it be the end of the fishing industry as well
3195669 as long as these core men are still there and quick action is taken we will be able to regenerate within a reasonably short time
3195670 these taxes and duty were pushing our operating costs up by 30 to 40 per cent compared to foreign vessels we are being penalised for being local companies which is bizarre and ludicrous
3195671 having three of the four operational virginia class boats and pcu new hampshire at sea is a reflection of the hard work dedication and team work that is our submarine force
3195672 this will become a common occurrence in the future but today its the crowning achievement of a huge cast of people who made it possible
3195673 its a real feather in the cap of the submarine force to be able to take a new design from concept through real employment in such a short time and in such an efficient and effective manner
3195674 i urge the russian federation to carefully consider the implications of this aggression against the sovereign and democratic state of georgia
3195675 russias relations with the united states and others in the international community will be affected by its continued assault on georgia and its refusal to contribute to a peaceful solution of this crisis
3195676 we must condemn russias military assault on the sovereign state of georgia the violation of the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population
3195677 similarly we need to condemn the destruction of georgian infrastructure
3195678 now let me say about mr khalilzads statement regarding terror against the civil population
3195679 such a statement honorable mr khalilzad is absolutely unacceptable moreover when it comes from a representative of a country whose actions with regard to the civil population are well known in iraq in afghanistan even in serbia
3195680 i reject categorically the assumptions that we are conducting the military operations indiscriminately
3195681 mr alasania went as far as to argue that supposedly a statement made by a russian prisoner of war an air pilot during an interrogation in georgia supposedly that he was instructed by his superiors to fire indiscriminately such an argument is right on blasphemous and outrageous especially when made during the open session of the un security council
3195682 the situation in abkhazia remains extremely concerning with a military build up continuing on the abkhaz side of the zone of conflict as well as bombings of the upper kodori valley
3195683 over the past two days the abkhaz side has moved troops and heavy weapons into the zone of conflict
3195684 several dozen russian bombers are in the georgian skies and have been attacking throughout the country over the past several hours
3195685 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia
3195686 peace has to return and civilian populations have to be protected thats the only thing and from that point of view president saakashvili accepted pretty much all the proposals we made
3195687 if the ultimatum is rejected all necessary enforcement measures will be used
3195688 we are not going to surrender any arms to the russians
3195689 there is a special section on two leading gujarati women of fiji other chapters deal with gujarati contribution in law politics education business and sports one chapter is a case study of the rise of a gujarati family it is the story of the parshotam family
3195690 the second part deals with personal histories and biographies the family history of the narseys is dealt with extensively
3195691 from hawkers to million dollar duty free shops from small grocery stores to giant supermarkets from a small retail store to a conglomerate of industries from a tailors shop to a giant garment manufacturing concern young men and women with basic education to doctors lawyers and accountants the journey of gujaratis in the fiji islands spans a 100 years of growth
3195692 for most other cis countries russia is their main strategic partner and they dont have any interest in seeing their relations be reduced with moscow in fact that would be very damaging for them so its in their interests to remain silent
3195693 we have information confirmed by our specialists that several vessels of the black sea fleet left sevastopol and either made their way or were making their way toward the territory of georgia
3195694 obviously if this is confirmed we will have to reconsider the conditions under which these vessels would be able to be stationed on the territory of ukraine
3195695 very concerned over the situation in south ossetia and expresses the hope that the sides will make efforts to find a peaceful solution to the disputed issues as soon as possible which will make it possible to restore stability and peace in our neighboring country
3195696 weve seen over the few years that putin was in power the restoration of russian power through the growing economy
3195697 and they have shown an increasing willingness to become involved in former soviet states in order to retain them within the russian sphere of influence and i think this really re certifies the fact that russia is really willing to become involved in armed conflict in order to retain influence over regions that it feels as part of its backyard so i think for most post soviet countries that is really a telling development
3195698 mr putin responded by leveling a blow at americas caucasus darling
3195699 quid pro quo in the caucasus or where we are is a new era in international relations
3195700 what we have proposed now and it has been signed by georgian president saakashvili is a non paper a proposed agreement which calls for a cease fire humanitarian aid and a withdrawal of troops back to the positions that there were in before the conflict started
3195701 im not in the blame game im in the business of trying to find a peaceful solution to a very difficult situation
3195702 need to be cool calm and collected on this one and im sure that at the end of the day well find a solution
3195703 russia is historically a guarantor of security for the peoples of the caucasus it is our mission and our duty
3195704 we have never been and never will be a passive observer in that region
3195705 russian peacekeepers and support units are carrying out an operation aimed at preventing georgian forces from regrouping to carry new attacks on south ossetia
3195706 senaki is one of the places where such actions were under way
3195707 this is a matter of principle the 1992 agreement which was signed by the georgian side too clearly defines the boundaries of responsibility of the russian contingent and the peacekeepers do not have the task of invading georgian territory
3195708 unfortunately the fighting has hurt civilians like all the conflicts of the world this is a misfortune this is impossible to support
3195709 that is why we dont just have to denounce only but we have to work to stop the fight and that is the purpose of our common visit with finish foreign minister alexander stubb
3195710 kouchner and his convoy with red cross vehicles and georgian officials very quickly left the military hospital he cut short the program of his visit
3195711 the reason stemmed from an incident that took place today when the georgian president and kouchner were visiting the site destroyed by the bombing at that moment an alarm sounded and bombers appeared again
3195712 with regard to the georgian leadership which has unleashed aggression i have said that we are using a tact of enforcing peace in accordance with the un charter
3195713 we believe this is an absolutely effective and the only possible tactic
3195714 we are just observing international law and listening to all sides
3195715 from our side hostilities were ceased a long time ago we dont want any more bloodshed and we are calling for peaceful negotiations after all it all happened on our territory
3195716 many people are arriving and representatives of europe and the u s unequivocally assert that they all respect georgias territorial integrity but it is very difficult to predict what steps russia will undertake who would have imagined that they would bomb four large civilian apartment blocks in gori this is psychological warfare already declared against the civilian population people are very scared
3195717 prevent the expansion not only of nato but of democracy
3195718 we hope that the international community will move to some sort of action to protect our statehood because if there was any doubt up until now i hope that no one has any doubts anymore that we are facing a full blown operation directed at abolishing the sovereignty of our country
3195719 and this is something that we have lived through in the 1920s and we hope that the world will not let this happen again
3195720 show that there will be a political cost for this action in terms of the relationship of the russian federation with its western partners
3195721 scale of cynicism and the ability to cast white as black and black as white
3195722 its a pity that some of our partners are not helping us but instead are essentially trying to get in the way
3195723 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3195724 saddam hussein as you know had to be hanged of course for destroying several shiite villages and the current georgian rulers who simply razed 10 ossetian villages to the ground who ran elderly people and children over with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds those leaders are of course being taken under protection
3195725 i said this violence is unacceptable i not only said it to vladimir putin i said it to the president of the country dmitry medvedev
3195726 whether this now puts russia in a different category a kind of international disturber or outlaw that cant be treated as a partner in the way that western countries have wanted to since the end of the cold war
3195727 the city of tskhinvali which is in the midst of a humanitarian nightmare has again come under fire from georgian forces
3195728 georgians are also trying to flood the city where many remain trapped under rubble and could drown witnesses say georgia has been using cluster bombs on the city
3195729 the form in which the georgian sides actions took place cannot be called anything but genocide because they were on a large scale nature and targeted individuals the civilian population and peacekeepers who were fulfilling their duties to preserve peace
3195730 besides the information we receive shows that extremely serious crimes were committed people were killed burned crushed by tanks their throats were slashed
3195731 maybe an international tribunal should be set up specially for this case just as international tribunals were set up for other instances of massive extermination of people and massive destruction of cities
3195732 the responsibility for the deaths of innocent people in south ossetia lies with georgias leadership
3195733 since civilians and peacekeepers have died as a result of georgias attack
3195734 moscow can turn to the hague tribunal and the strasbourg human rights court to investigate the deaths of its citizens
3195735 any such conflict affects the internal political situation by stimulating flag waving patriotism
3195736 this is particularly unpleasant considering the extremely distressing anti georgia campaign we saw two years ago if the armed conflict continues to escalate i think the russian leadership will have to take the utmost measures to prevent anti georgian agitation in the country
3195737 few russians know about the roots of the conflict in south ossetia i think that the russian population is mostly indifferent to this problem
3195738 the majority of people are much more concerned about economic problems such as inflation and poverty than about foreign policy
3195739 if your enemy is secure at all points be prepared for him if he is superior in strength evade him if your opponent is temperamental seek to irritate him pretend to be weak that he may grow arrogant
3195740 whatever part of georgia is used for this aggression is not safe
3195741 the statement on the ceasefire was made to lull the public into a sense of security but we are remaining vigilant we the military must not relax
3195742 we have completed the bulk of an operation to force georgia to accept peace in south ossetia russian peacekeepers have assumed control of tskhinvali
3195743 artillery attacks on tskhinvali resumed about an hour ago six salvos have been fired
3195744 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3195745 we have made it clear to the russians that if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
3195746 we will begin an operation to force out all georgias security forces located there this will be a combat operation with the employment of all our militarys armaments
3195747 russian troops are currently disarming the surrounded georgian forces in south ossetia
3195748 we have eliminated the possibility of an aerial threat from georgia in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
3195749 we did not bomb georgias oil pipelines if we had done this oil spills and possible oil fires could have led to a regional environmental disaster

3195752 hits zijn geweldig maar niches vormen de nieuwe grote markt
3195753 toen andersons artikel in wired verscheen kwamen er studenten op me af om te vragen of ik het stuk had gelezen rond diezelfde tijd gaf anderson ook een presentatie op harvard zijn theorie sloeg enorm aan de muziek en filmindustrie liepen ermee weg je kwam de long tail tegen in business modellen ik vond het een interessant idee maar twijfelde wel meteen of andersons verwachtingen klopten
3195754 andersons theorie druist in tegen alle bestaande literatuur je kunt wel een enorm media aanbod hebben maar dat betekent allerminst dat mensen hun vraag automatisch aanpassen fragmentatie van de media leidt niet per se tot een fragmentatie van het publiek in andersons boek staat ook weinig bewijs voor zijn claims dat kun je hem misschien niet kwalijk nemen hij heeft een business boek geschreven hij is geen wetenschapper
3195755 dat klopt bovendien blijkt uit een vergelijking van de verkoopcijfers uit verschillende jaren dat hits in de loop der jaren ook niet minder belangrijk worden een kleine selectie hits voorziet nog altijd in een groot deel van de vraag de staart van het productaanbod wordt wel langer maar de verdeling van verkopen over die producten wordt steeds dunner mensen zijn nauwelijks ge nteresseerd in al die nieuwe niche producten
3195756 in zijn boek kijkt anderson vooral naar de aanbodzijde niet zozeer naar de vraagkant hij heeft natuurlijk gelijk als hij zegt dat het aanbod groter wordt de tail wordt langer maar wat betekent dat voor een mediaproducent of voor een winkel wat moeten die anders doen moeten producenten hun aandacht verdelen over een grotere groep producten en moeten winkels een groter assortiment aanbieden mijn conclusie is dat er voor de producent vrijwel niets verandert en dat winkeliers erg voorzichtig moeten zijn met het uitbreiden van hun aanbod
3195757 stel dat een producent honderd miljoen euro heeft te besteden anderson suggereert dat die producent zijn geld in de toekomst meer en meer in een groot aantal kleine projecten moet stoppen telkens n miljoen in honderd projecten bijvoorbeeld in plaats van 100 miljoen in n project zoals nu vaak gebeurt immers anderson beweert dan onze vraag zal verschuiven naar die niche producten en dat als je de opbrengsten van die projecten bij elkaar optelt ze veel waard zijn de realiteit is echter dat de kans steeds groter wordt dat producenten vrijwel niets verdienen met een niche productstrategie de competitie in de tail wordt steeds intensiever en de meeste producten genereren bijna geen verkopen om een voorbeeld te geven bijna de helft van alle dvds op de markt in de verenigde staten verkocht in 2004 niet meer dan 300 exemplaren en een kwart niet meer dan 50 exemplaren dan zie je hoe lastig het kan zijn de productie en distributiekosten terug te verdienen laat staan winst te maken
3195758 voor de retailer kan er wel wat veranderen omdat de transactiekosten voor het aanbieden van een product via internet veel lager liggen dan in een gewone winkel kun je ook zaken aanbieden die je in een normale winkel niet kunt vinden maar ook hier liggen de zaken wat gecompliceerder en wordt het er zeker niet makkelijker op winkels moeten zich realiseren dat ze met de meeste niche producten weinig kunnen verdienen en hun activiteiten zo organiseren dat ze geen of vrijwel geen kosten hebben aan het aanbieden van de long tail een slimme online boekwinkel maakt bijvoorbeeld niet zelf de pagina met informatie over een boek waarvan hoogstwaarschijnlijk maar n of twee exemplaren worden verkocht maar laat de auteur of uitgever dat zelf doen ook is het verstandig om zon boek niet op voorraad te hebben liggen in een distributiecentrum maar het on demand te printen als iemand het wil kopen
3195759 het grappige is dat ik dat zelf ook opmerk in mijn artikel die 10 000 nummers vormen 1 procent van het totaalaanbod bij rhapsody de 10 procent meest beluisterde nummers bij rhapsody zijn goed voor 78 procent van de plays ik ben de eerste om te zeggen dat alleen kijken naar relatieve cijfers allesbehalve zaligmakend is alleen kijken naar absolute aantallen heeft ook zo zijn nadelen trouwens het gaat om de combinatie
3195760 andersons mening lijkt in de loop van de tijd te verschuiven aanvankelijk leek hij de staart te defini ren als alle producten die alleen via internet verkrijgbaar zijn de long tail begint dan dus waar het aanbod van de fysieke retailer ophoudt maar nu zegt hij dat je naar de grootste retailer moet kijken walmart dat is een bijzonder onhandige definitie walmart is een warenhuis en geen specifieke media retailer en als hun assortiment bepaalt wat de head is kan n manager bij walmart een enorme ruk aan de tail geven bovendien heeft het weinig te maken met de kracht van het internet de muziekwinkel op de hoek van de straat had altijd al een veel groter aanbod dan walmart
3195761 ja heel veel sommige mensen geloven niets van mijn onderzoek en vinden me een complete idioot wat ook wel eens verfrissend is om te horen maar gelukkig heb ik veel berichten gekregen van managers uit de mediawereld die de patronen herkennen die ik beschrijf en die aangeven blij te zijn dat het bestaande beeld is rechtgezet businessweek de wall street journal en andere publicaties hebben lovend over mijn onderzoek geschreven en veel blogs hebben er aandacht aan besteed verscheidende grote uitgevers hebben me ook benaderd met de vraag of ik een boek wil schrijven
3195762 toch wel een beetje het onderzoek dat ten grondslag ligt aan mijn onlangs verschenen artikel in harvard business review was al ruim een jaar in het publieke domein de papers stonden al op mijn website ik dacht dat de meeste insiders wel wisten wat mijn resultaten aangaven dat bleek dus niet zo te zijn
3195763 im going to be playing this game until gta 5 man

3195766 not even svn can automatically decide what changes to make live and what not to make live between developer changes
3195767 not even svn can automatically decide what changes to make live and what gt not to make live between developer changes
3195768 andrew scott wrote gt what gt do you mean by repo gt server and server gt repo gt gt the latter should never be an issue or even considered anyone who makes gt changes to production and not in a development environment shouod be hung gt out to dry or better still beaten with a stick until you realise that gt development is what it means so you think the entire etc folder on a production box is the same as an etc folder on a development box you think they have the same hostnames the same ip addresses the same firewall rules that the test environment has a two year backup retention like production has not everybody uses svn just for sourcecode some use it for their university thesis some for their grocery list some use svn for complete server configurations and what you use it for does influence the usage pattern it is perfectly acceptable to change the dmail host oarameter in your jvm config file directly on production and then back it up to svn gt once you have deployed to a production server it should never have any gt ties with the repository in any way shape or form if you are one of gt those that think this is ok then you will need to adopt new procedures gt quickly before you adopt bad and i mean very bad ideas generally speaking you dont want to have production running directly from a working copy but there is nothing wrong with putting id headurl etc in your sources so that code and configuration files on the production box points back to a specific version of a file in a repository
3195769 dont put words into my mouth as for xml changes that are not related to your source code is generally handled by daily backups anyway and most people prefer that as it can put the machine into a state quicker than your method but hey thats your choice you want to create extra work for you then go for it as for the actual content of the source files did i ever mention anything about that no i did not and i wouldnt like to have you tell me otherwise

3195775 so i wrote to her a diplomatic letter but with some hints of romance meaning i was very warm towards her i was a total failure in trying to seduce amanda vanstone she was not terribly impressed

3195786 mike adamle might not have worked as a commentator but he might actually work as gm
3195787 i understand that comes with the territory because past champions tested positive for drugs
3195788 the olympic champion does have to be clean and then to be able to prove it
3195789 people will always speculate about drugs and they know what im doing in the us where im getting drug tested a lot
3195790 i dont know how usain is taking this but i assume its a lot of pressure
3195791 people in his country are expecting him to come home with that gold medal i assume its the same for asafa
3195792 we wont see a clean olympic 100m champion not even a single clean participant no doubt about it

3195824 a lot of these diseases arent as prevalent in our country anymore but in foreign countries they are very prevalent and people still travel to our country and they bring those infections here so its very important to protect our families from these diseases
3195825 i dont think that this business it belongs in the heart of downtown on chester avenue
3195826 i dont think that it belongs here i dont believe that it should be here schools are really close the buena vista museum
3195827 mummy can you actually cry with happiness this is the best day of my life ever
3195828 as the semi trailer has entered broadwater it has clipped the rear of one of the b doubles before it rolled on its side and the cabin collided with the second oncoming b double
3195829 if i had chronic pain i would certainly check i was getting enough vitamin d
3195830 taking too high a dose of vitamin d supplements as a means of preventing or treating chronic pain could result in vitamin d toxicity and high blood calcium levels
3195831 we saw a lot of road kill and thought of you
3195832 at this stage weve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating that theyre needing to seek protection in australia
3195833 any large event in australia is going to absolutely have in amongst the people who come here those who are seeking protection
3195834 its a very clear and known means for people to flee persecution in their country of origin
3195835 obviously were aware that there are pilgrims out there who have been given three month visas and so it might well be at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection
3195836 at this stage we amp squo ve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating that they amp squo re needing to seek protection in australia
3195837 any large event in australia is going to absolutely have in amongst the people who come here those who are seeking protection
3195838 i think they should hear georgia will never surrender georgia will never surrender
3195839 no matter how superhuman a military you have if you have not been preparing the attack for months and months for gods sake how can you mobilise into another country 1 000 tanks within hours if its not a premeditated attack on a neighbouring country
3195840 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3195841 we will go to the end because we once lost our freedom to russia
3195842 i think they should hear georgia will never surrender georgia will never surrender

3195847 these are places nobodys gone before in essence so this is a first step
3195848 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure
3195849 they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3195850 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3195851 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3195852 right now it looks like kaneakua friel kind of a converted tight end h back is doing the best job there
3195853 there are two or three candidates but right now if we had to play he would be the one that would be in that spot
3195854 hell be fine i dont know if he will be out tomorrow or not i think it is a bone bruise in the sternum is what they told me
3195855 i expect him to be ready for the first game i dont think theres any risk he wont be ready for our opener if it is close i am not going to practice him until i know hes ready
3195856 right now it is the most solid that i have seen it since i have been coaching here
3195857 not only the first five players but the next three i think we have eight that i am very comfortable with right now i am very impressed
3195858 someone smashed one of the alarm call points after a big night out we know exactly who it was and the guest has been charged 1500 for the call out fee and to fix the call point
3195859 it was a fairly big stuff up by the guest and when she was asked why she did it she said she had no idea and she was upset and disappointed with herself she left next day
3195860 we were about 75 per cent full so thats about 200 people and we aim to get everyone out in about three minutes
3195861 following an incident at the hotel two cabin crew members were stood down pending an investigation
3195862 he came running around the corner and just immediately started spraying us
3195863 it was burning our eyes when we realized what was happening we just started trying to protect each other
3195864 my next door neighbor in the mall went after him and another merchant went after him too
3195865 its that someone would assault any other human being and thats what im very upset about
3195866 do you know how embarrassing that is we live in that street
3195867 i feel famous over john key but i didnt get any money
3195868 john key is kind of cool hes alright but he named us as the battle street we didnt like that
3195869 its about how all the different groups get on with each other
3195870 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3195871 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3195872 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3195873 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3195874 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3195875 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3195876 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3195877 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3195878 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3195879 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3195880 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3195881 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3195882 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3195883 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3195884 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3195885 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3195886 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3195887 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3195888 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3195889 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3195890 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3195891 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3195892 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3195893 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3195894 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3195895 an islamic regime must be serious in every field there are no jokes in islam there is no humor in islam there is no fun in islam
3195896 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3195897 turner had these songs he thought would be appropriate for me to sing on we recorded it a while ago but weve both been so busy so i dont know if itll come out
3195898 it was really fun playing with them at festivals in france and spain weve known
3195899 for the last three or four summers weve been going over to europe and doing all the festivals and it looks like we just totally ignored our fans in america but thats not the case as a consequence the american fans miss us and they want their metallica so this will be a good homecoming for them and us
3195900 we were talking to lars and he goes were going to take you guys on tour
3195901 tomorrow the new record releases its just a really amazing time in our lives
3195902 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit more
3195903 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3195904 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3195905 a stripper who murders the boyfriend of a young couple with her bare hands before taking the girlfriend hostage
3195906 quentin is convinced britney will be brilliant shes delighted she thinks it could turn her career around it is perfect tarantino material he wanted to get britney first shes playing the most important character
3195907 couldnt remember the last time she actually enjoyed going to the pool
3195908 eri has to be the bad one talk bad about me dont waste your acting talent mah

3195910 us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also been noticeably absent on the diplomatic scene having failed to interrupt her holidays to fly to tbilisi in support of the georgian government instead senior state department official matthew bryza who oversees the caucasus region was sent two days later than planned to join a joint eu us mediation effort to win a ceasefire
3195911 weve made clear that future acquisitions are likely to be in the logistics arena in asia
3195912 it fits in with the direction the company has discussed with investors
3195913 while this type of deal would expand their international presence europe represents an additional developed market that provides limited growth opportunities
3195914 the key for ups long term success will be to develop a foothold in emerging markets first and foremost is the chinese market in which they are already ramping up operations followed by other areas including india and brazil
3195915 ups already has significantly developed networks of its own in tnts coverage map
3195916 ups has its own highly disciplined and efficient system and i just cant see them absorbing a system on the scale of tnt and thereby having to bring it up to ups standards in a way that would benefit shareholders
3195917 both fedex and ups are quite deliberately building their businesses on a global model which is one of the key reasons why we view them both positively
3195918 again this comes down to shippers trying to keep their margins up in the face of rising fuel costs
3195919 if ups can fully assist the beijing 2008 olympics they can fully assist you
3195920 i think a lot of the mistrust associated with jpepa began not as a result of the actual provisions of the treaty but the secretive manner in which the government went about with it
3195921 said roxas chairman of the senate committee on trade and commerce and co chair of the jpepa joint panel
3195922 the government must shift from this policy of minimum disclosure that the government seems to have adopted in all its dealings from the nbn zte project to the grp milf agreement on the bangsamoro juridical entity and others
3195923 some say we could have gotten more others claim we gave up too much let me be candid i too feel that we could have negotiated better we could have gotten more
3195924 the choice before us is not the present jpepa versus another better jpepa that we can pick and choose from the choice before us is the present jpepa versus no jpepa and an uncertain future as to when it could be renegotiated again and what terms we could actually obtain at that future time
3195925 its about time that the senate reviews and consults with stakeholders on the need to ratify the amendment to the basel ban convention the important thing is to get started with the discussions
3195926 persephone the eternal expatriate the goddess of unreconciled contrasts and alternate allegiances chose to eat the seeds of the pomegranate that she might enjoy two roles two worlds
3195927 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
3195928 so never worry about tomorrow because tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own
3195929 turn all your anxiety over to god because he cares for you

3195950 how do you know hell get close enough to the hydra
3195951 i dont know but he growls low in his throat when hes really close its like something deep inside of him loathes hydras
3195952 there are many stories about hydras and dragons clashing the gist of the stories is that dragons and the hydras are mortal enemies rather like bears and wolves in your universe
3195953 when a head comes close jam the fire into its face

3195957 im not in love but im gonna fuck you til somebody better comes along
3195958 you were from a perfect world a world that threw me away today today to run away
3195959 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted
3195960 he healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds
3195961 casting all your care upon him for he careth for you
3195962 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor
3195963 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest 29 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
3195964 confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much
3195965 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
3195966 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us
3195967 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
3195968 i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me
3195969 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye
3195970 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
3195971 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him
3195972 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised
3195973 he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his names sake
3195974 and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have aught against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses
3195975 then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant even as i had pity on thee and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses
3195976 but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes
3195977 looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled
3195978 you need to be discerning of the voice of the devil it is your responsibility not to give consideration or pay attention to it
3195979 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
3195980 as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us
3195981 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
3195982 i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins
3195983 draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
3195984 he has brought you back as his friends he has done this through his death on the cross in his own human body as a result he has brought you into the very presence of god and you are holy and blameless as you stand before him without a single fault but you must continue to believe this truth and stand in it firmly dont drift away from the assurance you received when you heard the good news the good news has been preached all over the world and i paul have been appointed by god to proclaim it
3195985 lord jesus i love you thank you for bearing my burden on the cross i ask that take these inner hurts painful memories and emotional wounds from me right now i submit them to you and accept your peace in place of those things which i am giving up
3195986 lord jesus christ i realize i am a sinner i believe you died and shed your blood for the remission of my sins so that i may have eternal life right now i turn from my sins and ask that you come into my life changing me into a new person and washing all my sins away i receive you as my personal lord and savior amen

3195996 we should stop trying to understand each other because we never will
3195997 well sometimes god makes mistakes when he designs the female body
3195998 life is like a box of chocalates you never know what your going to get
3195999 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3196000 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between and distant observations of impacts on species
3196001 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3196002 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3196003 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3196004 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3196005 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3196006 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3196007 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3196008 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3196009 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3196010 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3196011 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3196012 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3196013 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3196014 we extended an existing wall to improve the overall environment for olympic events
3196015 writing in the much poorer world of 1899 thorstein veblen argued that people spent lavishly on visible goods to prove that they were prosperous
3196016 theres a huge window thats open and i do believe theyve got to close that

3196018 a searing indictment of the election process as it affected both the 2004 and 2006 elections and could affect the outcome of the 2008 election
3196019 our country has a long and varied history of stolen elections systematic disenfranchisement and manufactured election irregularities
3196020 yet most of us still accept on faith the integrity of the election process i hope that watching uncounted so close to the presidential election will shake to the core any preconceived beliefs and encourage immediate action before its too late
3196021 the notion of stolen elections is something we assign to third world countries but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as
3196022 election integrity doc uncounted to premiere on national cable network
3196023 the first large block of voters to be disenfranchised in 2008 are the wounded warriors from recent wars and homeless veterans living at hundreds of department of veterans affairs facilities across the country according to veterans and voting rights activists

3196209 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3196210 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3196211 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3196212 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3196213 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3196214 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3196215 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3196218 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3196295 the way our current players inter change is definitely different to the united teams ive played for in the past
3196296 the front of three or four seem able to play in every position across the front line and its difficult for opponents and defenders of the other teams to know who theyre going to be playing against from minute to minute let alone match to match

3196307 traksys has always provided users and all levels of management with the relevant real time intelligence necessary for making decisions crucial to improving productivity and business performance

3196310 on july 11 2008 we completed the purchase of natural gas and oil producing wellbores and related assets in the appalachian basin from quest resource corporation
3196311 on august 15 2008 we plan to pay a quarterly distribution of 0 43 per unit which is 7 5 higher than the level indicated at our ipo in november 2007 subject to final approval from qelps board of directors we anticipate our appalachian acquisition and organic growth from our operations in the cherokee basin will allow the partnership to increase its distribution paid in november for the third quarter of 2008 by an additional 16 and 28 to an annual rate of between 2 00 and 2 20 up from 1 72 currently the planned total distribution increase over the second and third quarters from the first quarter is consistent with the guidance we provided in conjunction with the closing of the appalachian basin acquisition
3196312 we are pleased to report solid operating performance for our second fiscal quarter
3196313 when combined with the farm out agreement that we consummated in the quarter qrcp owns the right to develop more than 122 000 net acres within the recognized fairway of this emerging shale play and more than 7 000 net acres outside the fairway qrcp plans to drive reserve and production growth through the development of this large acreage position and fund the development with the distributions we receive from qelp and quest midstream and existing cash balances in the second half of 2008 we plan to drill up to six wells on our appalachian acreage including up to three horizontal and three vertical wells
3196314 with the petroedge acquisition qelp added long lived natural gas producing properties that are immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per unit add geographic and geologic diversity receive premium natural gas pricing and offer numerous opportunities to complete the existing wells in additional formations with proved developed non producing reserves subject to final approval from its board of directors qelp anticipates the petroedge acquisition and organic growth from its cherokee basin operations to enable the partnership to increase its distribution paid in november for the third quarter of 2008 by an additional 16 and 28 to an annual rate of between 2 00 and 2 20 per unit up from 1 72 per unit currently the planned total distribution increase over the second and third quarters from the first quarter is consistent with the guidance qelp provided in conjunction with the closing of the petroedge acquisition
3196315 quest midstream has the right of first offer on gathering and processing of qrcps and qelps production and this acquisition provides quest midstream the opportunity to build a significant presence in appalachia quest owns 85 of the general partner and a 36 limited partner interest in quest midstream
3196316 we believe the future for quest is bright as we continue the low risk development of our large acreage position in the cherokee basin while building a new core area of operations in the appalachian basin we look forward to developing our sizeable acreage position in the basin and further illustrating the benefits of our unique structure

3196344 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
3196345 the state of new hampshire will continue to work closely with local communities and volunteer organization to help ensure our citizens who were impacted by the storm get the assistance they need
3196346 recent storms have caused significant damage in many communities across new hampshire which is why we are asking fema to begin assessments to determine eligibility for federal assistance

3196353 no tuvimos posesi n de pelota y eso es importante para darle un respiro y podernos poner en campo de ellos perdimos la pelota muy r pido y consecuentemente eso hace que el equipo se te eche encima
3196354 s nos falt salir un poquito m s cuando tuvimos la pelota cuando tuvimos que salir equivocamos los pases por ah pudimos haber tenido un par de jugadas m s una que diego no dispara y otra que se trompica la pulga pero en t rminos generales el equipo estuvo muy ordenado aunque nos falt salir m s y recuperar la pelota m s al frente
3196355 es lo mismo que cualquier otro rival le damos el mismo respeto la misma atenci n como siempre lo hemos hecho y le damos la prioridad porque es el pr ximo rival la amistad es fuera de la cancha dentro de la cancha es toluca es al que representamos y lo hacemos con todo con este rival y con cualquiera
3196356 somos un equipo bastante experimentado tenemos que manejar tambi n los tiempos si queremos defender lo mejor forma ser a con el bal n adem s con este cuerpo t cnico desde que lleg la palabra defender se borr del diccionario entonces nos deja un mal sabor de boca pero sabemos que el mi rcoles tenemos una final y al jugar en casa tenemos que ganar

3196362 de hecho me enter que estaba en el estadio observando el partido de nosotros al final del mismo
3196363 ya que son m s peligrosos porque los jugadores que entrar a sustituir siempre dan mucho para mostrarse su din mica es mucha vienen de perder y eso los hace todav a m s complicados
3196364 son seres humanos y cometen errores en nuestro partido hubo acciones que fueron rigoristas pero bueno hay que estar preparado para todo eso
3196365 el equipo hizo buen trabajo el equipo se mostr bien y ah vamos pues creo que contra todo eso hay que luchar
3196366 hay equipos que pesan en su cancha y quiz si hubiese sido otro equipo no hubiera pasado nada pero son decisiones que deben tomar los rbitros pero ante un p blico y ese equipo de jerarqu a s debe de pesar
3196367 nos vamos a seguir encontrando en el camino con esto arbitrajes rigoristas si ahorita sucedi creo que habr muchas m s y hay que ser un poco m s precavidos
3196368 nos debemos ocupar en jugar bien ganar los partidos si pasan ese tipo de cosas debemos ser conscientes que debemos remar contra todo eso
3196369 creo que habr mucho penales en el futbol mexicano donde los jugadores invaden el rea y nunca lo repiten creo que el rbitro fue muy rigorista
3196370 si estaba a un metro creo que era mucho pero bueno fue as no era para tanto el penal ya lo hab a pitado y haberlo repetido fue mucho peor que pitar el mismo penal
3196371 igual el equipo nunca agach la cabeza sigui luchando consigui el empate y creo que al final lo tuvimos para ganar
3196372 es un entrenador que trabaja en la semana que quiere ganar y que le piten una jugada de esas claro que lo calientan y por eso reacciona as
3196373 sabemos el car cter que l tiene reaccion as y el rbitro decidi expulsarlo pero creo que cualquier entrenador hubiera hecho lo mismo
3196374 este torneo me brindar muchas posibilidades para probar tenemos d as para entrenar y pensar realmente que es lo mejor para ellos
3196375 estoy tranquilo por que dejamos buenos puntos en el torneo local por el ltimo partido que me agrad porque tuvimos poco tiempo para entrenar el cambio de sistema y a m me agrad much simo sab a que no desconoc a el planteamiento y al final creo que le dimos una sorpresa al equipo rival
3196376 no me preocupa lo m s importante en este momento es recuperarlo a l m s all de que uno piensa en la instituci n hay que recuperarlo siempre ha sido un s mbolo en este equipo desde que lleg ha sido el m ximo goleador y en lo que a m compete tengo que recuperarlo lo m s r pido posible
3196377 para m no deber a de haber m s de tres jugadores en caso de que re nan el perfil que el t cnico no encuentre en otro jugador mexicano hay buenos jugadores como el caso de gabriel caballero y de antonio naelson quien se nacionaliz desde que estaba en primera a y yo creo que no lo hizo pensando en la selecci n mexicana habr a que reconocer las aspiraciones leg timas de los jugadores que se nacionalizan
3196378 yo s creo que debe de existir un l mite porque m s all de lo futbol stico yo creo que la identidad nacional se da por muchos otros factores no s lo al vivir muchos a os en el pa s
3196379 ah es donde creo que la federaci n mexicana como pol tica de registro debe de poner un l mite no debe haber una selecci n como en alguna ocasi n la tuvo espa a en 1962 en la que ocho integrantes eran sudamericanos nacionalizados espa oles
3196380 estamos interviniendo y haciendo lo que sea necesario para enderezar esto
3196381 hay dos buenas personas que por razones distintas no son hoy parte de esta organizaci n y es una pena
3196382 el hecho es que los jugadores deben hacer un examen de conciencia y entender que tienen que responsabilizarse por parte de esto

3196384 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3196385 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3196386 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3196387 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3196388 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3196389 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3196390 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3196391 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone

3196404 we were tracking it earlier in that week and we knew that things were escalating
3196405 i can tell you it moved quicker than we anticipated that first day
3196406 i think a lot of what youre asking needs to be ironed out
3196407 some of these little issues are definitely still big questions in this event what was the intent who started it why did they start it and why werent they prepared to defend what they started
3196408 we dont see anything that supports they are in gori
3196409 once it did happen they were able to get the forces quickly and it was just a matter of taking the roads in so its not as though they were building up forces on the border waiting

3196416 and i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by they words thou shalt be condemned
3196417 thou shalt not take the name of the lord your god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
3196418 for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another
3196419 but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak

3196438 sa tingin po natin maganda yong nangyari kahapon katulad na ng ni report din ninyo meron tayong kaunting mga sinok ng kaguluhan like for instance in basilan
3196439 so overall masaya po tayo sa resulta ng halalan we think itoy magandang pasimula para sa ating efforts to automate 2010
3196440 well ang projection po natin ay within 36 hours after the close of voting so anytime po between late this afternoon or early tomorrow kaya ho natin hindi mabigyan ng saktong oras ay dahil marami po masyadong variables especially biyahe ng balota from the precincts to the counting centers ang timetable po natin talaga ay late this afternoon until early tomorrow morning
3196441 kasi dati po yung canvassing mano mano po so habang nagka canvass sa ibat ibang lugar nakikita natin pwede nating sumahin on our own ia add add natin ang mga resulta eh ngayon po dahil automated ang canvassing natin sa lahat ng lugar sa armm talagang wala po tayong ganoong makikikita isang announcement lang po at the end of it all
3196442 titingnan po natin kung yong dami ng voters affected will be significant to the final tally kunwari at the end of canvassing na natapos na natin lahat at makita natin na yong resulta from tipo tipo would not affect the outcome significantly posible pong hindi na magkaroon ng special elections doon but if the number of affected voters is high enough then mag iiskedyul po tayo hopefully within the same month
3196443 oo very good very good the way things went the conduct of elections iyon lang mga nandoon pa rin napakadami naming balita sa ganoon at merong iba kahit mahirap i prove pero alam mong nangyayari iyong bentahan at bilihan ng boto nandoon pa rin
3196444 pero iyong walang dayaan talagang na minimize kasi hindi masyadong humahawak ang tao sa balota o sa sistema maganda iyon namenosan ang human handling o human intervention malaking bagay ang nagawa noon
3196445 i dont think so eh mahirap gawin iyon mahirap palitan at hindi nakapaghanda ang mga hackers napakaliit ng espasyo ng time din para ma master nila ang sistema at maka hack dahil alam mo tayong mga pilipino ay number one hacker ang nadiscover na hacking na ginawa sa amerika ay pilipino pala pero im sure this one there are enough safeguards at napaka limited ng time para makahanap sila ng sistema
3196446 we are always looking at humanitarian disaster everytime huge numbers of people are driven from their homes

3196718 with the olympic opening ceremonies only days away we knew that we had to move quickly
3196719 we had three goals first we wanted to quickly create an online resource for people who had been defrauded second we wanted to alert the world about the scam because the various olympic committees did not appear to be doing so and third we wanted to be able to update the web site at a moment s notice as developments occur
3196720 we have never populated optimized launched and marketed a site so quickly
3196721 they rapidly informed people throughout the world about the scam
3196722 i came to the conclusion that the world is a big place and there is more to life than watching the daily commuter traffic and allowing passing cats to urinate on you

3196728 if in fact a google property is taking money away from googles partners that is a real problem
3196729 the question in peoples minds is how unbiased can google be as it grows and grows and grows
3196730 when you see knol pages rank high they are there because they have earned their position
3196731 our vision still remains to be the best conduit that we can be connecting people between whatever their search is and the answer they are looking for
3196732 for that reason we are not interested in owning or creating content
3196733 our job which is to organize that information kicks in
3196734 google can say they are not in the content business but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work it is getting harder to make that case
3196735 they are competing for talent for advertisers and for users
3196736 we understand this question to be focused primarily on the implementation of deep packet inspection advertising practices by a small number of u s isps in partnership with a privately held online advertising company google does not deliver advertising based on deep packet inspection

3196741 i think print magazines are a great place to see new work because you can see what established shooters are doing when they have a bit more freedom to create work within a brief
3196742 youll see some of the most stimulating work by photographers in editorial shoots and it gives you a good sense of who that photographer is and where he or she could take the work
3196743 i feel like i go to the bookstores and magazine stands about once a month and pick up anything that has visually exciting work
3196744 i always pick up french vogue because it tends to be a bit more provocative and visually more compelling than where we are in the states
3196745 i havent awarded any jobs yet to photographers whose editorial work i liked but ive definitely tracked down their web sites and or called in their books for review
3196746 i think that transition is more likely to happen with fashion
3196747 in fashion its a given you see something great in editorial and you know you could make a beautiful ad out of it other genres might be more conceptual and you need to go with a known style
3196748 its amazing and beautiful you can find great stuff on there

3196774 we dont believe the puppies attacked him but the puppies were using him as a food source due to the fact that they just didnt know any better and he was on the ground incapacitated for a couple of days
3196775 hes incapacitated and needs full time care and should have had full time care and some of the medicines and treatments were not getting to him
3196776 i didnt get along with my dad real well i could never imagine treating him like that in his last days
3196777 that just blew me away i couldnt believe it that was going on right next to me
3196778 de meesten denken dan wel dat ik een erg zelfzekere vrouw ben maar eigenlijk ben ik dat allerminst zeker niet als het op bikini shoots aankomt zeven jaar lang heb ik ze gemeden en ik denk niet dat ik er ooit nog eentje zal doen momenteel heb ik terug wat meer vormen na die tour met de spice girls het was dus een grote mentale stap om me voor deze shoot te overhalen ik heb wel wat bruinende cr me gebruikt maar welke vrouw zou dat niet doen

3196784 while we dont comment on specifics for competitive reasons over the last year we have initiated a number of partner programs focused on new business co marketing vertical markets and solutions
3196785 we believe these investments will generate more growth opportunities for all hp partners
3196786 when i read hps materials and review their smb oriented programs they just dont seem to focus on my customers needs
3196787 cdw may drive some incremental sales for hp but they wont create a tipping point in the market i believe the tipping point will happen when someone really big in the channel deploys a new model that both encourages the business growth and success of their channel partner resellers and delivers a measurably improved quality of service to small business customers like the ones we serve
3196788 it is much like shoretels deal with cdw the voip vendor did a channel deal with cdw cdw can take orders over the phone and they can undermine my pricing but they cant really solve my customers needs and their solutions cant be as customized to my customers needs as mine are
3196789 i will lose an occasional deal to the call center guys but the customer will be the one who really loses because they will miss out on the value add that my company and many like me includes with our product and services sales to small business customers
3196790 you can get more feet on the street so to speak talking to customers and ensure people are thinking about hps brand
3196791 as the economy tightens around the world these development funds will get tighter a number of vendors have eliminated previously planned programs around customers and partners to utilize funds for headcounts
3196792 its a smart thing this deal between hp and cdw and i dont think its unintentional that this got out if i were cdw id think its a good thing to get headcount funding from competitors rapidly
3196793 his customers stick with him because he has a level of expertise and knowledge that keeps them around his game is providing expert knowledge at the same time a lot of his customers probably buy a lot of stuff from guys that move a lot more product than him because theyre a lot better at selling stuff in volume
3196794 so either you work with the expert knowledge guys to sell more product in addition to their services or you work with the guys that move a lot of product to do more solution services selling or try both anyway yesterdays fashion always comes back into style 10 years later

3196813 there is a lot of immediate agitation to express discontent on new issues such as price rise or the agreement with a foreign country on nuclear issues but there is little political murmur about the actual living conditions of indians
3196814 the removal of long standing deprivations of the disadvantaged people in our country may in effect be hampered when the bulk of the social agitation is dominated by new problems that generate immediate and vocal discontent to the neglect of gigantic older problems of persistent deprivation of human lives tolerated without much political protest
3196815 justice demands that we make a strong effort to identify the overwhelming priorities that have to be confronted with total urgency we have to ask what should keep us awake at night
3196816 whatever else nyaya justice may demand and we can have all sorts of different views on what a perfectly just india would look like the reasoned humanity of the justice of nyaya can hardly fail to demand the urgent removal of these terrible deprivations in human lives

3196821 notwithstanding the success to date in completing the groups funding program access to markets and pricing will continue to be challenging for all sector participants due to the expected volatility and possible worsening of the funding markets

3196826 the state of new hampshire will continue to work closely with local communities and volunteer organization to help ensure our citizens who were impacted by the storm get the assistance they need
3196827 recent storms have caused significant damage in many communities across new hampshire which is why we are asking fema to begin assessments to determine eligibility for federal assistance

3196829 mercenaries think opportunistically missionaries think strategically mercenaries go for the sprint missionaries go for the marathon mercenaries focus on their competitors and financial statements missionaries focus on their customers and value statements mercenaries are bosses of wolf packs missionaries are mentors or coaches of teams mercenaries worry about entitlements missionaries are obsessed with making a contribution mercenaries are motivated by the lust for making money missionaries while recognizing the importance of money are fundamentally driven by the desire to make meaning

3196837 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3196838 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3196839 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3196840 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3196841 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3196842 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3196843 it is a very grim situation and a dangerous one this russian invasion recalls variously the invasion of afghanistan 1978 the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and soviet invasion of georgia in 1922
3196844 we dont see anything that supports they are in gori
3196845 i turned my head and saw a big burst of fire next to my car

3196852 pre planned cold blooded and pre meditated murder of a small country
3196853 no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3196854 the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3196855 russia has played a positive stabilising role in the caucasus for centuries a guarantor of security cooperation and progress
3196856 this is how it was in the past and this is how it is going to be in future let there be no doubt about this
3196857 this is not about south ossetia this is not even about abkhazia
3196858 the strategic objective is regime change putin wants a puppet a satrap he is playing an extremely good game
3196859 russian peacekeepers and military units attached to them have been taking action to prevent georgia from shelling south ossetia and russian peacekeepers
3196860 president ma will not announce new aid on his visit if they make the request we will bring back the requests and review them
3196861 it is good to get a second race out of the way it was much tougher this time especially with a hard hit out at the start
3196862 im happy with my progess and im looking forward to the semi on wednesday tomorrow today im just going to take it easy and relax
3196863 hacker is looking in good form which he hasnt been in since 2006 but all the times are looking pretty good and it is going to be a pretty tight final
3196864 i wouldnt say that i was completely happy with that race but you take a helluva lot more from races like that than if i had beaten frida comfortably but im still confident i can get a place in the final
3196865 my start was pretty slow so i had to put in a few big ones at the 1000m but i didnt get the response from my boat so that is something i have to work on and kicking on in that last 500m so i come home with a bit of a sprint
3196866 sophie balmary marie is up and down and the serbian iva obradovic was right up there in the heats so it is who wants it the most
3196867 i think they should hear georgia will never surrender georgia will never surrender
3196868 no matter how superhuman a military you have if you have not been preparing the attack for months and months for gods sake how can you mobilise into another country 1 000 tanks within hours if its not a premeditated attack on a neighbouring country
3196869 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3196870 we will go to the end because we once lost our freedom to russia
3196871 as the semi trailer has entered broadwater it has clipped the rear of one of the b doubles before it rolled on its side and the cabin collided with the second oncoming b double
3196872 i saw a toyota corolla car stopped on the side of road
3196873 then seconds later three military vehicles of foreign troops were about to pass the small car when a strong explosion with dark smoke blackened the area
3196874 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3196875 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3196876 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3196877 the u n must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
3196878 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation
3196879 but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3196880 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3196881 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3196882 i had a guy shoot a gun next to me thats how bad it was
3196883 i thought i would see this only on tv never in real life
3196884 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
3196885 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3196886 theres no such thing youd better ask those who say hes going to resign
3196887 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation
3196888 for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including
3196889 the u s is voting for another president in november
3196890 i looked into putins eyes and i know i can trust this man
3196891 he made the remarks from the palm tree lined driveway of his vacation home here hawaii

3196896 our study is the first to specifically examine psa screening in younger men which provides an important assessment of quality of care especially for high risk groups

3196898 i felt he really was so committed to that character the guy that was playing that guy that as an audience you bought his sincerity very few people i think could pull that off
3196899 robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle
3196900 to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what hes doing is crazy the whole time
3196901 otherwise its just demeaning to brandons character and if its demeaning to an actual black man in the movie i would have run for the hills
3196902 if were all gonna play ball lets all play ball
3196903 i believe in fairness if we can punch you punch back and funny is funny
3196904 this sort of self important self involved thing seemed funny to me
3196905 i just couldnt figure a way to make that into a movie
3196906 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3196907 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3196908 you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think youre doing of what you think is the right idea
3196909 if people are accepting it the way that you intended and you feel that from a general audience then stand behind it
3196910 i just hope at this point with whatever little weve done to brand ourselves as entertainers that you give us a little slack
3196911 the victims were inside their yacht the men boarded and attacked
3196912 at 19 years 15 percent of runners had died compared with 34 percent of controls
3196913 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3196914 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3196915 over time all groups decreased running activity but the runners groups continued to accumulate more minutes per week of vigorous activity of all kinds
3196916 members of the running groups had significantly lower mean disability levels at all time points
3196917 almost all of them did something else they continued their vigorous exercise
3196918 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3196919 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3196920 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3196921 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3196922 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3196923 at this stage weve had about 20 people present to us as identified pilgrims indicating that theyre needing to seek protection in australia

3196928 said on sunday that it was pulling its troops out of the separatist province of south ossetia but its appeals for a ceasefire in the widening conflict in the caucasus failed to halt russias mounting military response
3196929 aims in the conflict had gone beyond securing the pro russian enclaves of south ossetia and abkhazia to weakening the armed forces of georgia
3196930 said that it was unclear whether russia intended a full invasion of georgia but that its aims could go as far as destroying its armed forces or overthrowing georgias pro western president mikheil saakashvili
3196931 the violence appeared to show gargantuan russias determination to subdue diminutive us backed georgia even at the risk of international reproach
3196932 russian tanks and soldiers poured into the devastated south ossetian capitol of tskhinvali after crushing a three day georgian attack to take control of its breakaway province the ferocity of the fighting could be seen on the streets
3196933 ignored calls for a truce and continued to bomb targets deep in georgia with little apparent opposition drawing new condemnation from the united states and other western countries
3196934 from the caucasus mountains to the middle east and south asia us diplomats and strategists say historical us adversaries such as moscow and tehran appear to be exploiting washingtons impending political transition and the white houses fixation on iraq to pursue international actions that might otherwise spark a more robust response from washington and its allies
3196935 as the fighting spreads to abkhazia on georgias black sea coast some western diplomats are worrying aloud over the regional implications of a new order in which russia reserves the right to use force to impose its will on neighboring states
3196936 gave another impassioned plea to the international community to come to his countrys aid
3196937 so far the us has shown no sign that it will offer georgia military assistance
3196938 is carrying 2 000 georgian troops back home from their stations in iraq
3196939 stop intervention and invasion of my sovereign country i think the u s has lots of leverage and i think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through and basically i think this is not about georgia anymore this is about basic values of humanity of american values that we always ourselves believed in

3196944 john edwards nasty mistress cattily dissed his cancer stricken wife to a friend and later coldly blamed the ailing spouse for getting her fired from a videography job on her lovers presidential campaign a new report claims
3196945 compared john edwards with gandhi and went around trashing his cancer stricken wife it was reported sunday
3196946 whispered allegations about john edwards were an open secret that was debated in every newsroom and reported by almost none
3196947 some national news organizations tried halfheartedly to confirm the tawdry tale they ignored it in public wary of the national enquirer of edwardss dismissal of tabloid trash of wading once again into the swamp of sexual scandal without definitive proof
3196948 early last week journalists were in the awkward position of refusing to report on explosive allegations that were almost certain to knock the former north carolina senator out of the democratic convention they were in a box of their own making one that came to feel airtight and uncomfortable

3196956 we knew that we were good even if we slowed down toward the end
3196957 as far as the first is concerned well it was the first in the final and of course nerves had a lot to do with it
3196958 as for the last i was aware that there was a real possibility of winning the gold so nerves again might have had a role
3196959 of course i was very tense i was under pressure and i was nervous but its part of the game
3196960 in order to prepare for that in korea we made our practice venues as close as possible to the actual venues sometimes we had a lot of people around us so we could simulate the actual setting of the game

3196970 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3196971 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
3196972 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country

3196984 i wouldnt say shes alves suffering but shes having to dig deep shes tired shes exhausted shes in pain when the contractions come youve gotta push and in between them those 30 second intervals shes passing out and then coming back to and that went on for hours
3196985 and we had this problem upon contractions the babys pulse would sink it was getting down to 70 which means the umbilical cord is somewhere strapped across the esophagus
3196986 the doctor called c section and as soon as they say c section 33 minutes later the babys out i was like 60 hours weve been in here and if wed have come in and just said lets just have it you could do it in three hours

3197039 scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
3197040 in a globalised economy we dont expect a smooth ride
3197041 i feel as though there is almost a weight off me now said a misty eyed trickett you do have pressure and you do have expectations and i place them on myself as well but ive got to a point where all i want to get out of my swimming is the best that i can do
3197042 i always say it would be nice to go back to small cossies still thats not what the world is about were not about going backwards
3197043 the government will be able to legislate on the first stage in the next 12 to 18 months
3197044 the second stage of the response will consider the remaining recommendations including those relating to exemptions from the privacy act and data breach notifications
3197045 the initial determination of whether there is a risk of harm to an individual will be done by the agency or the organisation
3197046 if you get a situation where there hasnt been notification and it does become public then im sure the privacy commissioner and others are going to be looking at this and asking why you didnt notify
3197047 at a talk that was given by sandi hardmeier who was the head of security for microsoft she said there is no system in the world that has been built that cant be hacked into it may be a one off situation that doesnt indicate the organisation is treating information willy nilly
3197048 they shouldnt require a large investment in technology to comply with what theyre recommending at this point all that is being recommended is that your systems are being monitored and that you can identify breaches and records of those affected by breaches
3197049 every financial services organisation does this as a part of the normal course of business that is monitor and know whats occurring on their systems
3197050 retailers are well monitored in terms of their back end systems the front end systems however which have been involved in huge debacles like tjx still have issues there but thats more about insufficient practices than insufficient technologies
3197051 it will be the result of either a mistake or done out of curiosity by an employee
3197052 if your bank knows that someone has written a worm to go after clients of that bank and it knows a certain number of customers have been affected does the bank have an expectation of disclosure well no they havent been breached the customer has been breached
3197053 its such a peculiar thing happening so its probably the same person
3197054 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3197055 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3197056 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3197057 this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
3197058 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3197059 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3197060 russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
3197061 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3197062 we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past
3197063 its clearly in mccains interests to draw as many contrasts as possible with obama on foreign policy
3197064 the more anxious people feel about foreign policy the more it benefits john mccain
3197065 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3197066 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3197067 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3197068 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3197069 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3197070 the police and military on the other hand need to act differently their faces look like they are made of stone theyre seriously scaring the foreigners in beijing the fact that theyre armed and look sinister just makes things worse thats why ive talked to chinas political authorities and the olympics organizers at our daily meetings ive asked them to get people to smile more
3197071 when i mentioned this in important meetings the hosts began to laugh now im called the ambassador of smiles
3197072 this scene went on for a long time like half the day and its getting old and i go over to sean and i guess he didnt know that i was wearing a prosthetic
3197073 i go sean youre such a great actor but you wouldnt do a scene like this if they asked you you wouldnt dive into a pool naked
3197074 and he said well james if i was built like you i would
3197075 a couple of weeks later we did this scene where were both dancing and were naked and we both have prosthetic penises he finally put it together that im wearing like the

3197081 man its just real lazy plus another thing nowadays is people spend too much time going to supermarkets and buying convenient stuff and parents dont do things like teach their children how to do simple meals at home
3197082 i can boil an egg but i just learnt how to poach an egg this year
3197083 its really inexpensive and its a great food value especially now with the price of everything eggs are the best value for money two poached eggs on a bit of toast is a great little meal great for the kids but if you cant poach an egg learn how to poach an egg

3197094 today many are dead and georgia is in crisis yet the obama campaign has offered nothing more than cheap and petty political attacks that are echoed only by the kremlin
3197095 the reaction of the obama campaign to this crisis so at odds with our democratic allies and yet so bizarrely in sync with moscow doesnt merely raise questions about sen obamas judgment it answers them
3197096 ja ik dacht laat ik het zonnetje maar in huis halen
3197097 dan hebben we het gevoel binnen ook nog een beetje

3197103 i knew there was a small chance of somebody pulling out so i did my usual preparations in case i had to swim today
3197104 but when the call came i couldnt get to sleep for about two hours it was relief at first then i thought well i could make the final
3197105 so now im feeling lucky about this meet and hopefully if all goes well you never know what can happen at the olympics
3197106 the last 12 hours have been an emotional rollercoaster for me but anyone whos in that final is going for a medal and thats what im intending to do
3197107 same pool same water i was just glad to have a lane
3197108 lots of swimmers actually like the outside lane as you can do your own thing
3197109 i didnt really expect to make the final today so i had nothing to lose nobody really expects us to do that well so we just go in get through the heats get into the semis then who knows

3197112 goedemorgen dames en heren door een misverstand in rotterdam lees mn collega kwam niet opdagen en ik zat nog aan de koffie toen deze trein moest vertrekken hebben we nu enkele minuten vertraging maar maakt u zich geen zorgen we gaan het inhalen dus we gaan gewoon op tijd in rotterdam aankomen hoor
3197113 nee joh tegen de tijd dat je mijn leeftijd hebt
3197114 oh oh sorry ik eh ik stond op haar doelend op mij want ik had m dus de hele tijd geholpen te letten
3197115 er is n ziekenhuis in ons land waar het rookverbod wel heel erg streng wordt gehanteerd namelijk in het ziekenhuis in spijkenisse
3197116 j h jij bent veel meer verwend dan wij vroeger

3197122 oh laat me raden hij is zeker een beetje lam das een bekend probleem bij de corsa
3197123 joh ik koop hier net die knop doe m er net in nu blijkt deze ook al lam te zijn
3197124 nee ik wil niet nee ik doe het niet nee waarom zou ik
3197125 doe het nou niet je krijgt er spijt van doe het niet
3197126 ik had al zon vermoeden dat u daar al stond gezien het geluid
3197127 ik had het leuk gevonden als ze verder kwamen maar ik zal er geen minuut minder om slapen hoor
3197128 the second rounds extremely early to play probably the best player going around at the moment but its a good time to knock him off too
3197129 its always going to be a little bit different playing back on hard court thats where i first got the injury
3197130 so ive probably been more worried since wimbledon on grass whether the hip was going to be right it wasnt too bad theres still times i can feel it now and then
3197131 it was good to get out of that second set and win that in straight sets
3197132 even though ive lost those hamburg i easily could have won
3197133 i was one or two points away from beating him hed won 80 odd matches on that surface in a row
3197134 ive had small chances against him but theres no doubt that hes improved since then
3197135 of course its disappointing because you always go into a match thinking believing and preparing to win and when you dont its disappointing
3197136 but its better than judo youre out there for a minute and you can get demolished and walk off someone got demolished in a minute yesterday so you know i had a good hour maybe

3197141 disingenuous calls for evidence that community schools work require a willful myopia on the effect on life in poverty on education
3197142 have seen asthma reach epidemic proportions among students living in poverty and they know that the lack of preventive and prophylactic medical care leads to more frequent attacks of a more severe nature and more absences from school
3197143 notice how the subjective measures teachers grades and parental reporting of grades conflict with the objective measures standardized test results and school recorded absences
3197144 one disappointing result was the failure of the investigators to connect with the childrens primary care clinicians and obtain an asthma action plan baseline data indicated that only one quarter of the asthmatic children in the study were receiving adequate treatment
3197145 the children in the intervention group missed a mean of 6 8 days of school compared with 8 8 days missed in the usual care group
3197146 the intervention was ineffective for children who were exposed to secondhand smoke at home but it was highly effective for the other children
3197147 overall the intervention provided significant benefits particularly for children with persistent asthma
3197148 the dimensions of poverty among children in the united states
3197149 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3197150 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3197151 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3197152 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3197153 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3197154 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3197155 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3197156 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3197157 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3197158 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3197159 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3197160 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3197161 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3197162 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are
3197163 these are places nobodys gone before in essence so this is a first step
3197164 if j lo can dance with twins in her belly then i guess you can hop around a bit
3197165 this is our area and we dont want to leave it
3197166 there are thousands of families living in tents with nowhere to go

3197170 women are well advised to keep out otherwise they may well be greeted with verbal abuse rotten eggs buckets of cold water and or urine
3197171 it is useful to remember that the ipcc concludes that there is only a 90 chance of a connection between global warming and the burning of fossil fuels in other words there is a 10 chance which i consider significant that there is no connection between the two
3197172 in order for that reproductive strategy to have worked at all it had to be perfect the first time no incremental steps could account for it
3197173 this was not at all what we expected if the orchids thrive on imitating female bees the match should be as perfect as possible

3197177 ideas for small businesses can be found from almost any skill or industry knowledge which can be turned into marketable new products or services
3197178 seeking suggestions of the small business owners entrepreneurs helps a lot
3197179 while doing web based research top get proper tip of starting a small business it is advisable to gather the important keywords
3197180 deciding the mode of business for example web based b2b b2c etc is really important
3197181 the promotional process and marketing communication strategy is required for making a small business popular
3197182 reviewing each and every step of the business process can be an added advantage
3197183 an mba degree can help to have better business ideas but it is not mandatory business sense and relevant experience usually can be of more value
3197184 hard work and dedication and a keen urge to have better revenue truly helps
3197185 the costs of renovating a substantial property can be considerable as a benchmark we advise clients to consider spending 600 2 000 475 to 1 590 per square metre the latter figure if its a total structural rebuild to renovate a ruin if the property merely needs internal modernisation and refurbishment installing new bathrooms kitchen and a heating system for instance you can generally halve this amount naturally when it comes to properties of a certain size its a great advantage to find one where the roof has been well maintained
3197186 provided theres suitable accommodation the owner can install a caretaker who will often be happy to live rent free in return for looking after the property and tending the garden and grounds
3197187 a good choice for folks who tend to forget their mobile accessories
3197188 you can sew your own clothes and even wear them in public
3197189 fed up with his students complete inability to spell common english correctly a british academic has suggested it may be time to
3197190 to kickstart his proposal smith suggested 10 common misspellings that should immediately be accepted into the pantheon of variants including ignor occured thier truely speach and twelth it should be twelfth
3197191 then of course there are words like misspelt often spelled mispelt not to mention varient a commonly used variant of variant

3197193 in mexico investigators have provided some tremendous leads to weapons trafficking organizations
3197194 tracing where these weapons are from is critical in the early stages
3197195 i think the question over whether this capability works has been settled
3197196 the question is what kind of threat how large a threat how sophisticated a threat the us faces
3197197 we provided a lot of information before it took place
3197198 its a safer route for our children to come to school
3197199 my understanding is there is about 35 000 cars that pass that area i know at least 300 kids who will use the bridge the kids are very grateful
3197200 were seeing an increase around the world due in part to the rise in islamic fundamentalism
3197201 the perceived honor of the family is seen as more important than the life of a child
3197202 the palestinian leadership has been working on establishing a palestinian state within the 67 borders
3197203 if israel continues to oppose making this a reality then the palestinian demand for the palestinian people and its leadership would be one state a binational state
3197204 ive seen you get standing ovations and ive seen you get booed out of the building
3197205 through all that you never changed who you are and i respect that
3197206 personally i wouldnt be caught dead doing some of the things you do
3197207 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3197208 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3197209 increase the value of the variable cnt by 1 unless cnt is greater than or equal to 5 or is not a number in that case set cnt to 0
3197210 joh stop maar al vertel je me nu dat je een bos peen tussen mn wielophanging uit hebt gehaald dan geloof ik je ook nog
3197211 dat hou je nog wel uit tot de grote beurt je rijdt toch niet zoveel toch
3197212 at first we thought it got hit by a car
3197213 this is a really dramatic example of how animals like people can burn
3197214 a common misconception is that animals have fur and its going to protect them
3197215 a lot of animals are found after its too late
3197216 field officers tell me its a grotesque find the molecules that hold the tissues together starts to disintegrate in the sun literally the skin starts sloughing off right in their hands
3197217 tie outs are one of the predominant calls we get
3197218 hello we are no cars and we have flown here from japan for one night only
3197219 we are kidding but some people really believe we are on tour ha ha
3197220 the reality is that this happens all the time in this country and disproportionally in prince georges county and most of the people to whom it happens dont have the community support and the platform to speak out so i appreciate you paying attention to our condition but i hope youll also give attention to those who may not have the same platform and voice that we have
3197221 yeah i know gordon doesnt have any previous nhl head coaching experience he has spent the last five seasons working behind the bench in providence in that role gordon has been dealing with young players trying to get them ready for the next step
3197222 on long island where snow wisely seems committed to rebuilding with youth gordon would be a good fit plus he wouldnt command a salary commensurate with previous nhl experience thats important to a franchise that continues to lose money also the isles still have to pay recently departed coach ted nolan for one more year
3197223 the criteria doesnt have anything to do with hockey its more about the city and what it has to offer whether its nightlife scenery or otherwise
3197224 when i talked to francois in june we both understood that the team was going to go forward regardless of what my decision was going to be and that enabled me to take as much time as i could
3197225 right now i know training camps approaching rapidly summers gone by pretty fast im going to make my decision here pretty shortly
3197226 at the end of the year to be honest with you i didnt know if i was going to come back i needed that time to really think about my future it was a tougher decision than i thought it was going to be at the end of the year its all about whether i feel im ready to go another year thats the biggest thing for me am i prepared to do what it takes to be successful for another year i know how much time you have to put in off the ice because playing hockey is the easy part
3197227 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3197228 on arrival at the site an isaf medevac helicopter was damaged in a hard landing rendering it incapable of completing its casualty evacuation task
3197229 but you have made a decision to write about everything how is that indecisive
3197230 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3197231 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3197232 als prinses m xima het niet kan wie weet dan wel de ware aard van de nederlander te ontcijferen en nu we het er toch over hebben bent u zelf wel een chte nederlander een test in 20 vragen

3197265 kilala ko si aileen ai ai kilala ko si kris ang sinasabi ko may mga bagay na hindi ipinipilit may mga bagay na hindi mo sinasabi na ai ai halika nga dito mag usap tayo hindi i never do that to aileen neither will i do that to kris hindi huwag mong pilitin mararamdaman mo yan e and wounds can be opportunities for wisdom ako alam ko kung maaayos yan at alam ko kung hindi maaayos
3197266 sanay na ako sanay na ako na mapagitnaan ng mga problemang ganyan gaya na lang nina gretchen barretto at dawn zulueta kris at saka si jobert sucaldito at si cristenelli cristy fermin
3197267 i come from the point of view of truth at saka hindi ako nag iilusyon na meron akong solusyon sa lahat ng problema sinasabi ko kapag nahihirapan ako
3197268 hindi dahil alam kong maaayos alam mo kung bakit ang pinanggagalingan kasi niyan ay walang masyadong direct participation si kris e
3197269 ang tampo ni ai ai bakit ako remember nagalit si ai ai kay james dahil kay kris kumampi si ai ai kay kris kuha ninyo so walang dapat pag awayan sina kris at ai ai tampong kaibigan siguro
3197270 hindi laging may tama hindi laging dapat may sagot sa tanong na sino ang dapat gumawa ng move may mga mangyayari at mangyayari nakuha mo
3197271 hindi ito ang tipo ng pagkakataon na dapat si ganito ang dapat unang ngumiti sa akin at si ganito ang dapat ganyan hindi may mga pagkakataon na bahagyang ipagsasapalaran ko pero dapat sensitive ka sa araw araw na nangyayari
3197272 kilala ko si aileen ai ai kilala ko si kris ang sinasabi ko may mga bagay na hindi ipinipilit may mga bagay na hindi mo sinasabi na ai ai halika nga dito mag usap tayo hindi
3197273 i never do that to aileen neither will i do that to kris hindi huwag mong pilitin mararamdaman mo yan e and wounds can be opportunities for wisdom
3197274 aileen is very emotional ano yan ako alam ko kung maaayos yan at alam ko kung hindi maaayos
3197275 hindi pa kami umuupo ni aileen hindi ko alam kung ano ang nakakarating sa kanya pero ang totoo kasi ganito yan di ba
3197276 iklaro natin si kris inimbitahan ni direk wenn na mag open ng pelikula ni ai ai sabi ni kris ill do it sabi ni james bakit mo gagawin it stars ai ai na galit siya
3197277 ang may problema si james at si kris then sabi naman ni kris kausapin mo lang ako kung makakasira naman sa marriage natin yan magpapasintabi ako at hindi ko gagawin
3197278 so alin ang problema dun nasaktan si ai ai dahil sinabi ni james na hanggang ngayon ay magkaaway sila at nasaktan siya at hindi naman babawiin ni ai ai yun
3197279 kung ano ang sinabi niya kay james paninindigan niya yun dahil sinabi yun ni ai ai on behalf of kris dahil si kris ang kaibigan niya wala namang away sina ai ai at kris diyan e

3197410 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon

3197419 the results suggest not all the large changes seen in arctic climate in recent years are a result of long term trends associated with global warming
3197420 given our less than predicted catastrophic sea ice loss this year coupled with this study it looks like arctic ice could be on the mend anthony larger image
3197421 our study confirms many changes seen in upper arctic ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature rather than trends caused by global warming
3197422 while some 1990s climate trends such as declines in arctic sea ice extent have continued these results suggest at least for the wet part of the arctic the arctic ocean circulation reverted to conditions like those prevalent before the 1990s
3197423 the winter of 2006 2007 was another high arctic oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum
3197424 it is too early to say but it looks as though the arctic ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again
3197425 the events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world
3197426 the close agreement between the north pole pressure gauges and grace data demonstrates graces potential for tracking world ocean circulation
3197427 satellite altimeters such as nasas jason are ideal for studying ocean circulation but cant be used at earths poles due to ice cover
3197428 our results show grace can be a powerful tool for tracking changes in the distribution of mass in the arctic ocean as well as its circulation
3197429 the pace of sea ice loss sharply quickened in the past ten days triggered by a series of strong storms that broke up thin ice in the beaufort and chukchi seas amundsens historic northwest passage is opening up the wider and deeper route through parry channel is currently still clogged with ice
3197430 subsequently a pattern has developed with high pressure over the beaufort sea and low pressure over the laptev and east siberian seas figure 3 in accord with buys ballots law this pattern has brought southerly winds to the region enhancing melt breaking up ice and pushing the ice edge northward

3197461 the real tragedy the true cultural loss the decline of the evil put down
3197462 i look back on the golden days of my childhood when teenage girls were at the very height of their powers they could ruin your life with two withering sentences they could have you in tears with the first word their laconic verbal artillery left shrapnel in the soul for years to come
3197463 being a bitch requires time and effort and a certain utter lack of caring what people think about you that simply isnt done anymore
3197464 constantly playing oneups wo manship for who can win the most votes in a neverending popularity contest

3197467 is there anything else i can help you with today
3197468 i dont think i always understand empowering like im exercising power over you if i hit you in the face with a bat specifically my power to hit you with a bat but this isnt an implicitly good condition is it
3197469 bitches have the power they are rich or beautiful or thin or smart or all of the above and allow their conversation to hammer this superiority right into the faces of their poor fat dim or otherwise disenfranchised targets
3197470 though the great bitches of hollywood were dressed to kill and magnificently shallow there was something incredibly honest about them these days though women are whines nags snobs and scolds instead

3197478 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3197479 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3197480 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3197481 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3197482 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3197483 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3197484 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3197485 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3197486 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3197487 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3197488 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3197489 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3197490 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3197491 stats indicate our generations financial literacy is abysmal with personal finances to match
3197492 swimming has had such a low profile in australia for so long that we found it hard to get any publicity
3197493 the media never seemed to be interested in us swimmers they were always off interviewing those publicity hungry badminton and water polo players and dont get me started on modern pentathletes
3197494 but hopefully these gold medals will change their minds they will see that swimmers have interesting lives and that their views on world events and fashion sense should not be ignored any longer
3197495 sure weve got better bodies and get to travel all over the world for free but we do normal stuff too im really looking forward to sharing my life with the nation
3197496 do a search for me on facebook check out my pics and youll see that swimmers get pissed and have fun just like everyone else

3197680 bruna the new messi i laugh at those things the new messi were talking about the best player in the world at the moment with some of the qualities that havent been matched ever a big tag for bruna to live up to ive seen some videos of him he is a short guy who is very mobile very quick runs with the ball well and who can become the new messi if you like but more realistically the new luis garcia but he is definitely useful for the kind of football that liverpool practices if he grows into the role and gets a little stronger he could be useful hes a talent who will develop at a club where he will feel important and with a club who know how to deal with youngsters but i wouldnt get too excited just yet
3197681 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
3197682 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
3197683 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
3197684 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed

3197724 the russian invasion of georgia is more than just a military action it is a statement to the world that russia is back and seeking to regain its superpower status in a carefully chosen military action it is essentially thumbing its nose at the west and especially nato i say carefully chosen because unlike the ukraine for instance there is very little if anything we can do of any immediacy to help georgia right now
3197725 the kafka industry doesnt want to know such things about its idol
3197726 perhaps kafkas biographers simply dont like the idea that their literary idol was helped out in this way in the vital early stages of his career of the worlds authors only shakespeare generates more phds more biographies more coffee table books everything kafka wrote every postcard he ever sent every page of his diary is regarded as a potential ark of the covenant yet no one has ever shown his readers kafkas porn
3197727 the many myths about kafka circulating among the semi informed public do include the idea of kafka as a kind of saint originally propagated by his friend max brod so its salutary to assemble evidence that he was human
3197728 kafka had a strongly visual imagination and the importance of the visual arts for him hasnt yet been fully explored
3197729 i read a lot of his things about him and from him but this one is something very important i think that in this short story there is everything from his creation everything very concentrated and thats why i chose this basic symbol a man who jumped another one on the shoulders
3197730 what bolivians have expressed with their vote is the consolidation of this process of change
3197731 with this ratification what has been confirmed is the countrys polarisation
3197732 in fact she even got a better deal she is now in a better school and one that is nearer to her house
3197733 this should not be the case does it mean that students should keep quiet no matter what a teacher does
3197734 ang surveys na yan surveys like that we dont accept them accurately but they are very good guides
3197735 lahat apketabo ng presyo ng langis the oil price hike affects everyone we recognize this
3197736 to be honest i had sort of forgotten that the pga championship was this weekend
3197737 so yeah i got home and there were 424 messages on the machine
3197738 at first i thought it was a joke i was thinking well played good sir but after the 87 th message i started to figure something else was going on i mean the guy really started to sound desperate
3197739 concerned with the well being of every player on the tour
3197740 most of the messages were like hey its me just calling to check on the knee to be honest i didnt really think we were close enough for him to say its me on my machine but whatever
3197741 anyway there were about 123 of those then there were an additional 134 where he was basically offering me money and other sorts of things to come and play things like all the
3197742 it got a little creepy towards the end though i mean there were about 84 messages where he was just crying in the phone
3197743 i was kind of touched by the whole thing as a gesture
3197744 its good to be wanted besides i dont even think he meant to call me 423 times i think really only about 415 of them were directed to me pizza when he called and a few times he butt called me and i just got to listen to a couple minutes of his day to day life on my machine ol dogg needs to learn to lock his phone
3197745 no i cant comb it because i cant get a comb through it
3197746 omg its john edwards hes so handsome and charming i always wanted to date fuck a kennedy
3197747 omg u r so fat no wonder your feet hurt
3197748 christ my left nipple hurts i hope its not cancer
3197749 i need an appointment with my overbooked doctor in a community with a doc shortage because i have a persistent cough
3197750 it would be so awesome if my foot would like not hurt anymore
3197751 the soul only knows for certain that it is hungry
3197752 face the guards in black attire with your teeth and fingernails
3197753 it went by real fast it was like a blur i remember when i was a rookie and everything is just a blur it wasnt a blur from the defensive side because i could actually see what was going on defensively but just trying to recall the information and my responsibilities as quarterback with each play it went by pretty fast
3197754 i take big pride in protecting the football especially in the red zone ill clean that up work on that mistake
3197755 if you ask every guy what we see out of chad that ball comes out on time receivers turn their heads and its almost hitting them in the face sometimes its amazing to see that on day one
3197756 i mean he doesnt know any of us from the man on the moon right now but he comes into the huddle and says give me your eyes we didnt break the huddle good one time and he was like nah nah nah next time weve got to stand and break the huddle just stuff a veteran with great leadership would do its pretty exciting
3197757 i felt like my little 4 year old going to his first football camp having no idea where to go or what to do
3197758 ill work to get the logistics of how we do things and make it a little easier on me
3197759 whatever route you have you better run it hard because the ball could be coming
3197760 as soon as you come out of your break the balls right here
3197761 you just have to have your hands up real quick
3197762 when you have a guy who can pressure the defence in many ways you know every routes available on the field
3197763 i wouldnt only say its just how fast the ball is coming
3197764 hes not going to wait for your eye contact he expects you to be ready for the ball
3197765 theres no such thing as a decoy route not as long as you have brett back there
3197766 like i tell the guys even when youre covered youre not really covered if you have two hands and two arms youre not covered because hes going to hit one of them so just find a way as long as you can see him he can see you
3197767 he just threw it up in the air and let him get it and youre like wow
3197768 laveranues couldve closed his eyes and it was right there in his hands
3197769 just growing up and watching him play and now him actually being my quarterback id be lying to you if i told you it wasnt way different
3197770 i didnt ever think it was going to be like that but im getting used to it every day
3197771 ive never played with a quarterback whos had a no look pass in their repertoire
3197772 you would think its a lot harder to catch because its coming so fast but his spiral is so tight that its actually a lot easier to catch
3197773 he does like to spread the ball around a lot
3197774 he gets the ball to the tight ends a lot i spoke to bubba and he said be ready hes right because at any time the ball can be coming your way it makes it a little more fun because you get out there and youre running routes and you know youre a live option on every play
3197775 i dont know if thats related to the marcos wealth or not
3197776 over all we see this as an agreement where we can move forward together to work with verizon rather than just being a contract for three years
3197777 very good para sa akin di ako mataas magbigay ng grado pero bibigyan ko ng 8 9 out of 10
3197778 report sa akin ng coordinator natin medyo may kabagalan the report we got from our coordinator indicates the omr counting is slow
3197779 paniwala ko sa 2010 hindi pwedeng isang technology lang pag aaralan pa rin baka may ibang technology na mas mahusay i believe no one technology can do the job in 2010 the government should study the right mix of technology
3197780 na test natin ang automated election process and its very good later on pwede apply yan pang buong bansa we tested the automated election process and its very good we can apply it nationwide
3197781 after taking two devastating losses like we did in the last minutes it was good to be able to come back and answer the call when all the adversity was against us and they had the momentum on their side
3197782 i wish we did what we did in the fourth quarter in the third and second quarter and first quarter
3197783 it was a tough one it felt like we were flat we have to find a way to pick it up quicker than we did
3197784 even though we had the momentum they found a way to get a big play there and turn it around
3197785 it was good that we were able to stay poised and composed and go out there when we had the ball on an opportunity to close it out and we did just that
3197786 i know me personally i have a lot of confidence in the guys that play so im not using that as an excuse at all
3197787 as a running back you want the load on your shoulders
3197788 the offensive line played well against a good defence they throw a lot at you we had three rookie offensive lineman they definitely held their ground tonight

3197799 orang orang kafir berkata mengapa al quran itu tidak diturunkan kepadanya sekali turun saja demikianlah supaya kami teguhkan hatimu dengannya dan kami membacakannya secara tartil teratur dan benar
3197800 allah meneguhkan iman orang orang yang beriman dengan ucapan yang teguh itu dalam kehidupan di dunia dan di akherat dan allah menyesatkan orang orang yang zhalim dan allah berbuat apa saja yang ia kehendaki
3197801 dan sesungguhnya kalau mereka melaksanakan pelajaran yang diberikan kepada mereka tentulah hal demikian itu lebih baik bagi mereka dan lebih meneguhkan hati mereka di atas kebenaran

3197805 ya rabb kami berilah kesabaran atas diri kami dan teguhkanlah pendirian kami serta tolonglah kami dari orang orang kafir
3197806 sesungguhnya seluruh hati bani adam terdapat di antara dua jari dari jemari ar rahman allah bagaikan satu hati yang dapat dia palingkan ke mana saja dia kehendaki

3197816 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century he said in his strongest condemnation yet of the fighting
3197817 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict he said
3197818 the russians are staying near gori they did not enter the city itself
3197819 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardise russias relations with the united states and europe mr bush warned
3197820 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government he said
3197821 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city said mr bush
3197822 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia and would be
3197823 the long view of history may tell a different story but in
3197824 to understand changes in the political map we naturally tend to look for contemporary explanations
3197825 andaikan tiap hamba mengetahui apa yang ada dalam ramadhan maka ia bakal berharap satu tahun itu puasa terus
3197826 hai orang orang beriman diwajibkan atas kamu berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kamu agar kamu bertaqwa
3197827 barangsiapa bertaqwa kepada allah niscaya dia akan mengadakan baginya jalan keluar
3197828 dan barang siapa bertaqwa kepada allah niscaya allah menjadikan baginya kemudahan dalam urusannya
3197829 hai anak anak adam jika datang kepadamu rasul rasul daripada kamu yang menceritakan kepadamu ayat ayat ku maka barangsiapa bertaqwa dan mengadakan perbaikan tidaklah ada kekhawatiran terhadap mereka dan tidak pula mereka bersedih hati
3197830 barangsiapa berpuasa pada bulan ramadhan karena keimanannya dan karena mengharap ridha allah maka dosa dosa sebelumnya diampuni
3197831 setiap amal anak keturunan adam dilipatgandakan tiap satu kebaikan sepuluh lipad gandanya hingga tujuh ratus lipat gandanya
3197832 kalau datang bulan ramadhan terbuka pintu surga tertutup pintu neraka dan setan setan terbelenggu
3197833 setiap amalan anak adam itu untuk dirinya kecuali puasa itu milik ku dan aku yang membalasnya karena ia orang yang berpuasa meninggalkan syahwat dan makanannya karena aku
3197834 kalau aku telah mencintai seseorang aku menjadi pendengaran untuk telinganya menjadi penglihatan untuk matanya menjadi pegangan untuk tangannya menjadi langkah untuk kakinya
3197835 dan apabila hamba hamba ku bertanya kepadamu tentang aku katakanlah bahwa aku dekat aku mengabulkan permohonan orang berdoa apabila dia berdoa maka hendaklah mereka itu memenuhi segala perintah ku
3197836 tiga doa yang tidak ditolak orang berpuasa hingga berbuka puasa pemimpin yang adil dan doanya orang teraniaya allah mengangkat doanya ke awan dan membukakan pintu pintu langit demi kebesaranku engkau pasti aku tolong meski tidak sekarang

3197838 pada malam itu turun malaikat malaikat dan malaikat jibril dengan izin tuhan mereka untuk mengatur segala urusan malam itu penuh kesejahteraan kedamaian sampai terbit fajar qs al qadr 4 5
3197839 kalau anda menemukan sesuatu yang sangat berharga di dalam hati anda akan tercetus suatu bisikan ambil barang itu ada bisikan lain berkata jangan ambil itu bukan milikmu bisikan pertama adalah bisikan setan bisikan kedua adalah bisikan malaikat
3197840 setiap orang berpuasa selalu mendapat dua kegembiraan yaitu tatkala berbuka puasa dan saat bertemu dengan tuhannya
3197841 sesungguhnya di surga itu ada sebuah pintu yang disebut rayyan yang akan dilewati oleh orang orang yang berpuasa pada hari kiamat nanti tidak diperbolehkan seseorang melewatinya selain mereka ketika mereka dipanggil mereka akan segera bangkit dan masuk semuanya kemudian ditutup
3197842 barangsiapa pada bulan ramadhan memberi makan kepada orang yang berbuka puasa maka itu menjadi ampunan bagi dosa dosanya dan mendapat pahala yang sama tanpa sedikit pun mengurangi pahala orang lain mereka para sahabat berkata wahai rasulullah tidak setiap kami mempunyai makanan untuk diberikan kepada orang yang berbuka puasa beliau berkata allah memberikan pahala kepada orang yang memberi buka puasa meski dengan sebutir kurma seteguk air atau sesisip susu barangsiapa memberi minum orang yang berpuasa maka allah akan memberinya minum seteguk dari telagak dimana ia tidak akan haus hingga masuk surga
3197843 siapa yang ingin rezekinya dibanyakkan dan umurnya dipanjangkan hendaklah ia menghubungkan tali silaturahmi
3197844 a slightly odd and definitely geeky thing to do but im going to praise some environmental research that has just been published yes even something from the stockholm environment institute whether their calculations are entirely correct or not isnt my point its that they are trying to answer an interesting question
3197845 recent educational research shows that students have a great need for hands on relevant learning experiences
3197846 that they would be at the home high school for those core academics sophomore freshman level receive some introductory classes in their areas at their home high school
3197847 we look at it as more of a feeder for those programs if a student chooses to go on for advanced training
3197848 its always one of the main concerns going away from home security and feeling safe those additional light post are nice insurance to have
3197849 augustana is a smaller college so i felt safer coming here and i dont have very many worries about crimes said dally
3197850 its nice to know you have some extra security you never know if its going to be a small campus or large campus whats going to happen to anybody
3197851 if you need emergency assistance all you have to do is push this button you get that dial tone and it rings into our 24 hour dispatch center

3197853 the growth is in almost every sector so it isnt just health care just education just financial services they are all adding jobs
3197854 often times its 85 percent to 90 percent of job growth is attributed to companies that are already in your immediate area
3197855 our tax structure land costs compared to where they are coming from transport arteries those things are always attractive when people are taking things to market
3197856 i think the new stadium is something we cannot put a measure on because the excitement that its created just by the kids walking past it let along getting on it practicing scrimmaging playing games
3197857 every time you walk into the weight room youre going to see it every time youre going to run you see that stadium i think its just a little extra motivation that you have
3197858 i dont know if itll be experience maturity what itll be
3197859 but we have to find a way if we want to be productive want to have a good year were going to have to find a way to win those games
3197860 thats one flaw in our program is that we havent been winning enough games our seniors are taking that upon ourselves and were going to try to get this team a winning season and then build off that toward a conference championship
3197861 unfortunately for the athletes they jump in and start working out and start practicing with the team and theres no ramp up process for those athletes
3197862 most common would be the muscle strains and the pulls in the hamstrings and quad when theyre running doing a lot of activities when they werent active all summer
3197863 make sure youre drinking plenty of water keep your nutrition up to date you have to have a good diet get plenty of sleep and work on your flexibility thats the best way to prepare when youre behind the 8 ball
3197864 you cant beat it now i just take the vacation and come for the whole week
3197865 its a free fair we try to get the people to come back year after year we try to get new people to come
3197866 all the entertainment demolition derbies the rodeos and you cant beat the price of the tickets
3197867 so much good entertainment for the price you cant beat it
3197868 at first it was difficult but now its part of the day like having lunch
3197869 he has a sense of doing something neat he feels like hes accomplishing something and he has were all thrilled
3197870 the thing i love about young children is theyre like sponges
3197871 theyre so eager to get all of it pick it up and learn it
3197872 he decided that kids could probably learn music the same way they learn their native language by being immersed in a very rich environment and constantly being encouraged and reinforced for every effect
3197873 just that sense of accomplishment hes starting something for life
3197874 i tell him you can start football but then youll end football at probably 25 really but youll play violin the rest of your life its a gift a lifetime gift
3197875 as far as i am aware the atomic bombing of the hiroshima city center in which forces acting on behalf of the united states government deliberately targeted a civilian center and killed over half of all the people living in the city at the time remains the deadliest act of terrorism in the history of the world
3197876 you can get glad in the same pants you got mad in
3197877 t he role for an fm radio station catering to listeners with an interest in and appreciation of the arts culture and a range of quality music is as strong now as it was when the station began
3197878 but artsound is much more than just radio the organisation has also established an enviable reputation for sound recording restoration and archiving with many private clients and national institutions
3197879 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3197880 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3197881 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3197882 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscar
3197883 unless i am convicted by scripture and plain reason and i do not accept the authority of popes and councils for they have contradicted each other my conscience is held captive to the word of god
3197884 the ioc means business in stamping out those who are not playing by the rules
3197885 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spinoff
3197886 i cant talk in front of people i can only talk to horses and dogs
3197887 you gain strength courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face you must do the thing which you think you cannot do
3197888 with a leash like that i figured that you were walking a huge uncontrollable monster
3197889 nope sorry three wish genies are a storybook myth im a one wish genie so whatll it be
3197890 i want peace in the middle east see this map i want these countries to stop fighting with each other and i want all the arabs to love the jews and americans and vice versa it will bring about world peace and harmony
3197891 lady be reasonable these countries have been at war for thousands of years im out of shape after being in a bottle for five hundred years im good but not that good i dont think it can be done make another wish and please be reasonable
3197892 well ive never been able to find the right man you know one thats considerate and fun romantic likes to cook and help with the house cleaning is good in bed and gets along with my family doesnt watch sports all the time and is faithful that is what i wish for a good man
3197893 plans are very hush hush but madonna is definitely going to celebrate her milestone in style unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind not least rehearsals for her sticky and sweet tour on top of all the stress of this she twisted her ankle over the weekend she views this as a sign that perhaps she should postpone the formal birthday bash and play it by ear instead madonna now reckons itll go ahead during a three day break in the tour towards the end of the month not next weekend
3197894 if we can hit that the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards checkmate
3197895 he said he was under stress and pleaded guilty only to put the matter behind him
3197896 what i want to ask is this this proposal you make is it for four legs only or also for two six months detention british passport free to stay guaranteed home this is excellent i will take and many other iraqis too
3197897 perhaps it reflects badly on me but i find a story like this more moving than the familiar stories of human suffering that populate the front pages of newspapers these days
3197898 the sahawa awakening began because people thought the americans were the enemy we rose up and let the people see the truth let them see that the americans are here to help us that was the true awakening
3197899 al anbar has changed so completely that it is hardly believable
3197900 i dont know what is going on sales have gone mad in the past two months we have gone from selling 300 pairs of tights a month to men in the uk to selling more than 1 000
3197901 german men have been wearing them for years more than 50 per cent of german men wear tights including famous german football players i cant imagine many footballers here doing that
3197902 quality needs to be put into magazines today otherwise there will be no reason for magazines to exist
3197903 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3197904 the moment we begin to fear the opinions of others and hesitate to tell the truth that is in us and from motives of policy are silent when we should speak the divine floods of light and life no longer flow into our souls
3197905 the whole tone of church teaching in regard to women is to the last degree contemptuous and degrading
3197906 the world has never yet seen a truly great and virtuous nation because in the degradation of woman the very fountains of life are poisoned at their source

3198056 sanay na ako sanay na ako na mapagitnaan ng mga problemang ganyan gaya na lang nina gretchen barretto at dawn zulueta kris at saka si jobert sucaldito at si cristenelli cristy fermin
3198057 i come from the point of view of truth at saka hindi ako nag iilusyon na meron akong solusyon sa lahat ng problema sinasabi ko kapag nahihirapan ako
3198058 hindi dahil alam kong maaayos alam mo kung bakit ang pinanggagalingan kasi niyan ay walang masyadong direct participation si kris e
3198059 ang tampo ni ai ai bakit ako remember nagalit si ai ai kay james dahil kay kris kumampi si ai ai kay kris kuha ninyo so walang dapat pag awayan sina kris at ai ai tampong kaibigan siguro
3198060 hindi laging may tama hindi laging dapat may sagot sa tanong na sino ang dapat gumawa ng move may mga mangyayari at mangyayari nakuha mo
3198061 hindi ito ang tipo ng pagkakataon na dapat si ganito ang dapat unang ngumiti sa akin at si ganito ang dapat ganyan hindi may mga pagkakataon na bahagyang ipagsasapalaran ko pero dapat sensitive ka sa araw araw na nangyayari
3198062 kilala ko si aileen ai ai kilala ko si kris ang sinasabi ko may mga bagay na hindi ipinipilit may mga bagay na hindi mo sinasabi na ai ai halika nga dito mag usap tayo hindi
3198063 i never do that to aileen neither will i do that to kris hindi huwag mong pilitin mararamdaman mo yan e and wounds can be opportunities for wisdom
3198064 aileen is very emotional ano yan ako alam ko kung maaayos yan at alam ko kung hindi maaayos
3198065 hindi pa kami umuupo ni aileen hindi ko alam kung ano ang nakakarating sa kanya pero ang totoo kasi ganito yan di ba
3198066 iklaro natin si kris inimbitahan ni direk wenn na mag open ng pelikula ni ai ai sabi ni kris ill do it sabi ni james bakit mo gagawin it stars ai ai na galit siya
3198067 ang may problema si james at si kris then sabi naman ni kris kausapin mo lang ako kung makakasira naman sa marriage natin yan magpapasintabi ako at hindi ko gagawin
3198068 so alin ang problema dun nasaktan si ai ai dahil sinabi ni james na hanggang ngayon ay magkaaway sila at nasaktan siya at hindi naman babawiin ni ai ai yun
3198069 kung ano ang sinabi niya kay james paninindigan niya yun dahil sinabi yun ni ai ai on behalf of kris dahil si kris ang kaibigan niya wala namang away sina ai ai at kris diyan e
3198070 so if ipa prioritize ni kris ang kanyang marriage naiintindihan namin yun pero wala namang away e ang pain ni ai ai ay bakit inuungkat pa ang isang bagay na ang tagal tagal na at nagsalita na ako na hindi naman babawiin ni ai ai yun
3198071 so i dont see the point sa totoo lang pinag iisipan ko theres no quarrel yung emotion naman ni ai ai na nasaktan siya naiintindihan ko rin i understand ang mahirap lang nito yung tatawid ka kasi iba iba na ang bersyon

3198112 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values

3198116 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3198117 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon

3198126 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3198127 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3198128 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings

3198343 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3198344 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3198345 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3198346 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3198347 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis

3198349 i want him fire i want them all out of here i want a reliever i do care just get one
3198350 appreciates the outpouring of concern and good wishes during this difficult time
3198351 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
3198352 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3198353 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3198354 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3198355 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3198356 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3198357 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3198358 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3198359 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3198360 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3198361 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3198362 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3198363 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3198364 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3198365 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3198366 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3198367 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3198368 pretendo deflagrar a propaganda sobre o voto secreto nos ve culos de comunica o j nos pr ximos dias

3198378 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3198379 my instinct tells me she probably would have done better if senator edwards wouldnt have been on the ballot
3198380 but that wasnt the circumstances at the time i think howard is fine in engaging in this kind of speculation but it doesnt really mean very much
3198381 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3198382 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3198383 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3198384 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3198385 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe

3198387 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3198388 the maoists still have the rebel army confined in camps and weapons in containers and the peace process is yet to be taken to a logical conclusion
3198389 maoists cant run the government if they are put in a wheelchair with their hands and feet tied together
3198390 if i had more money i would have stayed and never gone back
3198391 we hear from other returnees that they had regret going back because there is still bombing kidnapping and killing
3198392 god willing the flights will continue in order to fetch all families that wish to come back we welcome all our citizens who want to come home
3198393 some iraqis are choosing to return because the situation has improved in their areas but many others find themselves under many pressures in the host countries as their savings and resources have been exhausted
3198394 im concerned that i will not be able go out freely whenever and wherever i want like i used to do in egypt
3198395 i dont know how we are going to cope with our new lives it is going to be hard with no security electricity or enough drinkable water
3198396 it is of our duty to rebuild our country and to help rid it of sectarianism
3198397 look at the double standards of this government it did not help us during all the bad times in exile but when it came to its own political gains they sent a plane to get us back probably to our death

3198407 the president thanks you for your untiring fight your strong fight to restore constitutional order
3198408 i asked the mauritanian officials for a meeting with the former president but they rejected my demand but they assured me that he is in a good health and in a good living conditions
3198409 through collaboration with our us neighbors we will maximize both scientific and financial resources while collecting important data as part of canadas submission to the un by 2013
3198410 assist both countries in defining the continental shelf in the arctic ocean
3198411 the visit was short however with a great political significance it was a historic visit in my opinion
3198412 i think people are feeling keenly that the economy is starting to slow down and things are getting more difficult
3198413 young people are sympathizing because they see themselves and todays situation today in the novel
3198414 the sympathy is sporadic and i dont think it will lead to organized movements
3198415 things are different now from the stable employment conditions of japans period of high economic growth
3198416 life time employment is gone and its uncertain whether people will receive their pensions
3198417 the novels like a dream everyone uniting fighting and winning together
3198418 but i doubt well see that type of reaction now
3198419 i think that everybody felt like it was a breakout year for him
3198420 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3198421 a few of these guys is going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3198422 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3198423 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3198424 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3198425 its non displaced which is good news as were looking at it now we dont think it will be too long after that two week period
3198426 whether its three weeks or a little bit sooner than that or a little bit later im not sure
3198427 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3198428 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side
3198429 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3198430 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3198431 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3198432 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3198433 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3198434 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3198435 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3198436 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3198437 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3198438 if hes found out he doesnt like it well thats the only role we have for him at this time
3198439 he has not shown from a health perspective that hes been able to play every day in the outfield he just has to perform the task thats asked of him
3198440 finally starting to sort of feel good from the first hand injury then having the hand hurt again and being able to rehab through that and finally get to the point after six long weeks to be able to come through that
3198441 i was looking forward to him coming back as much as he was
3198442 its disappointing for me too i thought he was going to be our deadline deal getting him back healthy in the middle of the order
3198443 that leaves us three weeks for the season to be able to help in some type of capacity
3198444 i dont think anyone wants to play more than michael cuddyer its been a tough year and this is just another one of those things
3198445 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
3198446 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
3198447 i think people are feeling keenly that the economy is starting to slow down and things are getting more difficult
3198448 as the world burns 50 simple things you can do to stay in denial
3198449 pervez has insulted and compromised pakistans sovereignty by allowing the cia and fbi to operate freely in pakistan and arrest interrogate torture deport and detain any person whether pakistani or not for as long as they like thus turning the pakistani army and security agencies into hunting dogs in the contemporary crusade
3198450 the dominant political forces at work in pakistan today are competing to appease and please the modern day crusaders in the white house and are working to destabilise this nuclear capable nation under the aegis of america
3198451 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come
3198452 on the face of it the government has made great strides they the tigers are really hemmed in this time
3198453 im just not sure the military progress can be translated into political progress
3198454 my wife is on edge from the moment i leave home until the moment i return
3198455 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators
3198456 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now
3198457 the worry is that what seems like a passing phase might become a way of life
3198458 isnt a church plant i am starting to call it blue jeans church i know that sounds dumb but i think it sums up what we are trying to be about besides
3198459 for truly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away not an iota not a dot will pass the law until all is accomplished whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
3198460 if that means a new service and not a new church then i am okay with that
3198461 la vida es una mierda no vale la pena vivir

3198465 how head them mission a darky if his old lady axt
3198466 back in the old days we used to take our personal vehicles out on the ramp so i definitely noticed improved security which i say is a good thing
3198467 establish firm baseline security requirements across the industry that would be applicable to thousands of private aircraft in addition to chartered flights
3198468 you could put enough explosives on that small plane to do some serious serious damage
3198469 most airports there are a few but most airports do not screen their passengers do not care much about the airplanes
3198470 making the mistake of betting it all on them being the one in million or more who makes it big in professional sports
3198471 the song is simple its just me trying to pick up a girl at a club and convince her to come have some fun with me the video definitely has that story line in it but we just take it kind of different places to do some unexpected visual things we have this surreal kind of dance sequence and it features synchronized swimmers and showgirls we just throw a little extra twist on it
3198472 andre obviously blessed it the tempo and the feel of the song are really perfect for andres style so i felt like it was a perfect match and then he came and gave a great verse he really loved the song and he really wanted to do it
3198473 the album has a balance of uptempo midtempo and ballad songs
3198474 green light is the most uptempo but theres a few other uptempos on the record theres a couple reggae tunes a couple of classic john legend ballads and then a few midtempo songs as well

3198485 according to information from peacekeepers in south ossetia georgia continues to use military force and in this regard we cannot consider this document
3198486 the g7 ministers called on russia to accept an immediate ceasefire they expressed deep concern for the civilian casualties and continued attacks on civilian locations
3198487 they reaffirmed support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and called on russia to respect these
3198488 we dont know whether it is being adhered to 100 percent but it is time to say that there is no longer any justification for further military attacks
3198489 praised saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region

3198516 the moyston willaura football club is to be congratulated for what will no doubt be a fantastic event celebrating the contribution that moyston and its favourite son tom wills made to our great game mr helper said
3198517 this event is a real partnership between the moyston willaura football club the australian football league ararat rural city council and regional development victoria and recognises the important place that moyston holds in aussie rules football
3198518 id like to recognise the dedication of club president ruth brain and other club members in organising this celebration and im pleased the brumby government has backed their efforts
3198519 legendary coach kevin sheedy ambassador for the 150th celebration of aussie rules football will visit moyston to acknowledge its and tom wills special place in the history of our game
3198520 kevin will talk with students from local primary schools and watch a junior football session and participate in the seniors training session and then enjoy a spit roast with the local community in an evening of entertainment
3198521 during the evening sheedy will address the community and the short film king wilf and the pumas one of 11 finalists in the miff footy shorts competition will be shown the film was made by locals damien and brendan mcaloon

3198523 tom wills who founded the melbourne football club and laid down the rules of the game in 1858 and 1859 spent his early years at moyston minister for regional development jacinta allan said
3198524 tom was also an excellent cricketer and although he did not tour with the team he coached the aboriginal team that successfully toured england in 1868
3198525 it seems highly likely that the moyston willaura club will play finals football for the first time since the club was formed in 2000
3198526 our founder frank gason came from geelong to ararat with little resources simply to find a better way of life for his family gason management said in their statement for the nesa awards

3198528 the concept of a regional tourist organisation was put forward some years ago and its something weve been trying to get off the ground he said
3198529 there have been a lot of hurdles to jump over but im really pleased weve got to this stage and that weve got the five local government areas surrounding the grampians national park coming together to work together to promote this fantastic asset its an absolutely iconic destination
3198530 im really pleased to see weve got northern grampians horsham southern grampians pyrenees and ararat rural city all coming together to work for one common aim to increase visitors to our region i highly recommend this to council and i am very pleased that the ceo has seen the significance of the formation of this board and has taken on this role
3198531 its a really exciting time and i look forward to reports back on how we have been able to affect the visitor numbers to this region in terms of the dollars spent given some 270 million dollars are spent on tourism in our region at the moment an absolutely massive figure that people need to take a bit of time to take on board
3198532 were aiming to expand that and continue to grow that
3198533 the grampians is our one iconic tourist destinations and it has suffered recently probably through the bush fires but also through lack of promotion and investment he said
3198534 tourism victoria is firm in its desire to bring together the region that represents both halves of the grampians to try to get it more focused

3198546 since march 31 we closed on 375 million of new mortgages on unencumbered properties with these mortgages plus cash and credit on hand we repaid and refinanced the 522 million outstanding balance of the 750 million short term bridge loan that we utilized to purchase 50 of homart i in july of 2007 in addition we closed on the sale of the two maryland office buildings that we announced last january when they were put under contract
3198547 in april 2008 we refinanced and amended the terms of the senior bridge facility to reduce the principal amount to approximately 375 million substitute certain previously unsecured properties for the pledge within the collateral pool and to acquire an option to extend the maturity date up to an additional seven months to january 31 2009
3198548 go to their debt breakdown in q2 2008 though the senior bridge loan they said they knocked out some time before april 20 2008 is still there as of june 30 2008
3198549 as i said in my remarks this month we got new mortgages on 375 million of new mortgages on unencumbered assets and we used those funds in addition to cash that we had to pay off what was left of the 750 million bridge loan that we took out last july to buy homart
3198550 michael bilerman analyst citi its michael bilerman here with ambika as well bernie can you just go over you had fashion show and palazzo which have a maturity date later this year im not sure if you have extension options there can you just go over those loans as well what proceeds did you use to repay the 522 million on the bridge bernie freibaum i can answer the latter part first as i said we got 375 million of new mortgages so that was 375 million out of the 522 million the other 147 million was the combination of cash that we had left over from the equity offering that we did at the end of march plus a small amount of draw on our revolving credit facility
3198551 its 522 mn senior bridge facility and received an extended maturity date option for its senior bridge facility by additional seven months to january 31 2009
3198552 our core retail real estate business continues to deliver solid operating results
3198553 we are prepared to handle the expected weaker economic environment and will be well positioned to benefit when the economy begins to show improvement
3198554 strong comparable operating results at our malls demonstrate that our business prospects remain positive
3198555 despite the challenging economic environment our malls remain a very attractive venue for our customers to shop for our retailers to do business and for our lenders to lend we remain confident as we look to the future
3198556 in january when that mortgage came due we had offers from groups of life companies we could have done a five year or a ten year mortgage at the same proceeds level but given the things we want to change there and the outside growth in noi we didnt want to commit to a long term mortgage there either
3198557 you know we have read that notion and stories and weve asked all the life companies that we deal with whether or not they are going to be out of money or we shouldnt ask them if they are interested in making loans on our properties and not a single one has discouraged us from doing that some of the loans we are paying off are from life insurance companies and a lot of them want to maintain or grow their exposure to general growth
3198558 it wasnt too long ago in this industry where the life companies really covered almost 100 of the mortgages so this isnt unfamiliar territory for them
3198559 the second part of your question is the one i will answer first its the easiest there is a tendency for mortgages above depending on the bigger life insurance companies i would probably put the number at 125 million but call it 100 million or 125 million there is a tendency for the larger life companies to prefer taking a part of a loan as i mentioned earlier we had offers from a group of life insurance companies to put a new loan on fashion show of the same amount that we chose to borrow from banks 650 million and that was a group of them and unlike competitors in other industries they are very comfortable in fact very happy to participate with each other on loans so the larger loans if they are coming from life companies typically do come from a group of them
3198560 see a family with a husband a wife kids and they get into a ford focus because it doesnt matter what you offer them theyre not taking the bigger car
3198561 reservations for smaller cars are filling up faster than companies can keep up with
3198562 times have to give people free upgrades because dont have any smaller cars
3198563 they said they ran out of smaller cars and gave me an suv because thats all they had
3198564 they ought to be conscious of it so hopefully have more in the fleet
3198565 my company covering it so i went a little bigger for the room
3198566 ive never seen this before people not wanting to take a free upgrade and demand a smaller car never seen it before

3198568 clearly concluding the point of economic theory that increasing supply lowers the price of oil the studys author morris coats wrote
3198569 if an amount of newly discovered oil is significant enough to reduce prices in the future this indirectly reduces the current price of oil just as if there were a reduction in the marginal costs of extracting oil now
3198570 in american football the heidi game refers to a famous american football league afl game between the new york jets and the oakland raiders played on november 17 1968 in oakland california the fame of this game is the result of a decision by the nbc television network to terminate their broadcast with 65 seconds left to play in the game and instead broadcast a pre scheduled airing of heidi a new made for tv version of the classic childrens story with the jets leading 32 29 with only 65 seconds left in the game nbc programmers concluded that the outcome of the football game was decided and while only 65 seconds remained on the game clock in american football with timeouts and other clock stopping strategies a minute can easily last ten or fifteen real time minutes eager to maintain their evening schedule the network switched off the ostensibly decided game however the raiders came back and scored 14 points winning 32 43 but millions of american football fans were unable to see oaklands comeback

3198577 for me if i put the ball where i want it to go and the goalkeeper puts a save on it i dont care
3198578 all i have to worry about is where to put it and if they get a touch on it they get a touch on it

3198580 i will always be an ardent supporter of funding for transportation improvements i will even be willing to ask voters to support new taxes to fund these direly needed improvements but i firmly believe that we should take our time involve the entire county and craft a proposal that treats all areas of los angeles county with greater equity when the expenditures are made with those precious tax dollars
3198581 news of monsantos divestment of posilac is one more sign that no one wants the growth hormone rbgh used in milk production not even the company that makes it

3198615 different people will have different views of priority but we do know as we walk around the community people are concerned generally about the issue of health and how this government hasnt managed health properly

3198622 i believe they were just about to move in together
3198623 he would have a drink occasionally at a party but i should imagine that if he was doing something like a run he would have stayed in with michelle the night before
3198624 its just a terrible shame he was a wonderful individual who is going to be greatly missed
3198625 he was such a fantastic amazing caring fun loving person
3198626 he made everyone laugh and lived his life to the full he was living his dream in oz and seemed so in love with his girlfriend its devastating that he has been taken from us
3198627 i think lee should be an example to the rest of us in the world to go for what you want and do as much as you possibly can as you just dont know what is around the corner

3198640 although there are now other means of communication nothing has matched the reliability and performance of slts wire line service and this is not going to change in the immediate future
3198641 those copper lines are very important to our future as a telecom operator therefore we are expanding
3198642 thats something we didnt do during the last few years but we have changed that strategy because the best way to deliver broadband is the wired line
3198643 there is a big contribution from mobitel in the first half of the year and data revenues have also increased by a significant amount
3198644 margins on the fixed voice services are reducing because of competition but thats being compensated by the mobile unit and data revenue
3198645 its very important to get people hooked on to broadband
3198646 iptv is a good way to show people what broadband can provide tv is entertainment and everybody likes that but with iptv you are going in to the next generation of entertainment itll be a good catalyst to get broadband rolled out
3198647 the unique feature is time shift tv where you can actually pause live tv
3198648 you can then rewind the channel once you have watched the content you want you can go back to the live stream
3198649 already a lot of the phase three capacity is utilized so i think this year they will need more investment and yes we will support them in whatever way we can
3198650 we have some scale economies that work in our favor so when our top line goes up and if we manage our cost then we can preserve margins at a healthy level
3198651 there is a big new operator the fifth operator yet to come in to the market so we might have to expect further pressure on price
3198652 mobile profitability growth has been the highest in the first half and that will probably continue
3198653 entertainment and education are the two key areas that would develop business for iptv because of our unique feature of being interactive compared to other entertainment platforms
3198654 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3198655 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3198656 its quite possible that they will use this was support for their case but one cant determine that because a species is under less threat from extinction that its automatically okay to start hunting them

3198679 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
3198680 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
3198681 preliminary findings of the survey suggest that many people who would be defined clinically as obese find the use of the term obese highly offensive and would stop listening to further advice
3198682 to shrink from using the word obesity is really ducking an issue
3198683 it does not have to be used in a judgmental or insulting way if a child is obese then the parents should know that its obese we must make parents know that the lifestyle of the family needs to be modified
3198684 risks and benefits of bmi reporting in the school setting
3198685 our feeling is that the information should be given to parents if there is a serious health concern much like any other health concern a child might have
3198686 this information should not be included on a report card or such medical information should be kept separate
3198687 i never expected that i would be doing this for as long as ive been doing it
3198688 so looking back and seeing that its been over 40 years since the first hits makes you think is there a time that you stop
3198689 but i dont think im ever going to stop its the only challenge i have left in my life
3198690 because i do the same thing i run a two hour marathon every time onstage so i have my electrolytes kept at a certain level and i do my carb loading after the shows for the next night
3198691 somehow its dawning on me that im a more mature individual and im not a kid writing cherry cherry anymore
3198692 that after that happens where do you go you have gravity and it goes down
3198693 i have to be honest im not crazy about it
3198694 most of these people havent heard hell yeah or man of god but i see them and theyre listening and thats really all i want

3198702 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months but on this occasion because the damaging story is now being reported widely the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue we believe there has been a serious breach of the duke of edinburghs right to privacy we will be asking the pcc to remind all editors of their obligations
3198703 we have been informed that we will be receiving a complaint regarding the duke of edinburgh story over clauses one and three of the code accuracy and privacy but we have not yet received it

3198772 he was very respectful and understanding of the so called pecking order
3198773 he never once went to barry to talk to him about the hockey team he always went through me and allowed the people put in charge to make decisions make decisions
3198774 the contribution that i want to provide the team is more in the marketing and sales and strategic planning and budgeting
3198775 risebroughs area is to make hockey decisions and i dont want to get in their way
3198776 doug understands clearly these are his decisions my job is to budget and his job is to spend up to that budget frankly were talking about the 56 7 million salary cap here this is his job this is what hes paid to do
3198777 i have never given him an idea because it doesnt matter
3198778 it might as well be joe blow on the street dougs mind set is as gm and president mine is as fan and owner the person i want making decisions on the players is a guy who thinks like a gm not like an owner or fan
3198779 not just hockey if he plays golf with you he wants to win if youre out to dinner its all about the best wine or best cigars
3198780 for years craig convinced me he played an integral part in that game
3198781 it wasnt until i pushed him years later that i learned he was actually the 15th man and saw weavers shot from the bench
3198782 the second i saw her legs i said thats it
3198783 ive talked to him about this for almost 20 years and to be able to see a guy who had a vision and passion and then watch him intelligently and systematically go after it and bring his dream to fruition its extraordinary
3198784 craig calls me and says can you call then university of wisconsin hockey coach jeff sauer and get me the rules of hockey like what offsides is im about to spend 80 million to buy a pro franchise
3198785 i said youre doing what you dont know what offsides and icing is and youre buying a pro team then i watch this guy get to know this product fall in love with this product and sell and teach hockey to the country music capital of the world
3198786 i was half a day a week working on hockey stuff now im four
3198787 suddenly it goes quiet and everybodys looking at me oh god im sorry what are you guys talking about i realized right there this is not what i want to do anymore i went back to my office and basically said im selling this thing
3198788 i just love hockey and when you cant play owning a team is the best of both worlds its fast its physical these guys without a question in my mind are the greatest athletes in the world what they do and how they do it on a thin sheet of steel on top of frozen water is to me the most incredible thing in the world
3198789 my dad was a great role model from a work perspective and a great role model from a father perspective
3198790 clearly its where i get the way i operate what my priorities are hed always find time to make all my baseball and basketball games
3198791 the kariyas arnotts dumonts wanted to play in nashville and we have to have that same culture here
3198792 paul kariya was a guy who could bring other players with him even if they didnt know him thats something we probably need to get here that one player that makes the statement that this is the team where you want to be
3198793 but no one can say we didnt try to get a lot of players this summer
3198794 explorateur windows a cess de fonctionner puis explorateur windows red marre

3198796 this isnt like dark knight where heath ledger died while editing was in its infancy
3198797 most of our editing is done well go back and see if there is anything we can do better but mac left us with an indelible performance i think i got him at the top of his game
3198798 wed have some days that ran 12 hours and in between takes bernie would be cracking them up giving them an impromptu routine
3198799 he said that if it werent for the fans of his stand up comedy he wouldnt have the career he had
3198800 is eternally positive and thats the way he was in real life the movie gave him an opportunity to be extremely raw and showcase his singing and dancing talent
3198801 he liked to be spontaneous so i just took the reins off
3198802 comedians like to be fresh when they perform and they know whats funny better than anyone
3198803 i remember a routine once when he said that once children were old enough to speak they were old enough to be hit in the throat
3198804 i remember thinking how cruel that was then i had kids
3198805 ive listened to his music my whole life he changed what soul music could be hes the man
3198806 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3198807 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3198808 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3198809 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3198810 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
3198811 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country

3198816 i thought our guys were out there competing today it was a good and spirited practice it kind of went back and forth a little bit
3198817 were getting a lot done and our guys are getting better
3198818 its kind of where you are at camp there are some nicks and bruises but nothing real long term its what to be expected at this point its that time of year and that time of camp where guys are going and its physical its a physical game and youre going to get nicks and bruises but for the most part our guys are playing through it

3198824 our friend died on his own battlefield he was killed in action fighting a civil war he fought against adversaries that were as real to him as his casket is real to us they were powerful adversaries they took a toll on his energies and endurance they exhausted the last vestiges of his courage and only god knows how this child of his suffered in the silent skirmishes that took place in his soul

3198826 never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world
3198827 who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies

3198829 what does love look like it has the hands to help others it has the feet to hasten to the poor and needy it has eyes to see misery and want it has the ears to hear the sighs and sorrows of men that is what love looks like
3198830 everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and i learn whatever state i may be in therein to be content
3198831 i have found the paradox that if you love until it hurts there can be no more hurt only more love

3198861 in your mind do you believe america is a democracy or dictatorship
3198862 it has put democrats in congress a bit more on the defensive
3198863 it has given them a way to dramatically illustrate the idea they are for drilling and doing something and the democrats are not
3198864 americans have a lot of questions about why this congress is not working
3198865 i think it is ridiculous that democrats are not in session
3198866 the answer to what the russians plan to do with georgia has been given they plan to conquer it georgia under its old borders has effectively been lost to russia moscow now sits aside the transportation links joining tbilisi to the georgias black sea ports a russian column has also reached the senaki at the western end of georgias main flatland the kolkhida lowland the heartland of georgia is now split in two but the georgian army remains apparently intact

3198894 they do not see growth or change in this market in the near future
3198895 in the past everything was done out of new york and that was the place to be

3198907 we need an all purpose building to serve the same things that it did for 55 or 60 years in our community
3198908 we feel without that our history is being cut short
3198909 i dont know really if the city ought to have the ability to heat food in every building we have
3198910 ovens especially food preparation is a problem its messy its hard to clean up after and food and gymnasiums and people eating on gymnasium floors is probably not real conducive
3198911 we were ushered across the street and told our families would be arrested
3198912 run us over here to these places that are already overbooked and overcrowded
3198913 its a hard sell when you tear down whats considered to be a landmark in the african american community

3198915 weve made progress in america and i think as a sign of our progress we take advantage of the things our forefathers fought for

3198921 appreciates the outpouring of concern and good wishes during this difficult time
3198922 russia must reverse the course it appears to be on
3198923 if these reports are accurate these actions would be inconsistent with the assurances we received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in georgian breakaway region south ossetia that existed before the fighting began on august 6
3198924 these actions jeopardize russians relations with the united states and europe
3198925 there are no discussions about the u s getting involved militarily
3198926 we had a second crew for about a month in january to see if there was a call volume for it
3198927 from the feedback we got from the first responders they could see a dramatic change
3198928 has a collection rate of 3 percent over the national average
3198929 we would look at a 200 000 or 300 000 a year increase in revenue
3198930 we applied last year and theres 13 million dollars still out there but there were 2 500 applicants
3198931 i had a feeling jason was going to go fast but he could have gone faster than a speeding bullet and not caught the guy
3198932 it turns out that he did go faster than a speeding bullet and then some
3198933 everyone will tell you he is too old but i dont think he knows that
3198934 i could tell when he came back from 2004 that he was disappointed
3198935 i think that is what drove him the last four years
3198936 it wasnt until he was graduating when he became what everyone was expecting him to become
3198937 jason was faced with a dilemma do i go train at usc and move my wife and family
3198938 and jason made the decision to coach himself which is a gutsy thing in our sport
3198939 one of the big lessons he learned is that he cant worry about what he cant control
3198940 not that he was ever a loose cannon by any means but he let things bother him he is a much calmer person now
3198941 hell remember those 46 seconds for the rest of his life and a lot of other people will as well
3198942 he didnt take time off he didnt come out of retirement he just kept right on training
3198943 he pulled out a swim he probably didnt think he had in him
3198944 when a cause comes along and you know in your bones that it is just yet refuse to defend it at that moment you begin to die and i have never seen so many corpses walking around talking about justice
3198945 its one of those things if he had his druthers hed be in the lineup tonight but im listening to richie bancells our head athletic trainer and giving him one more day
3198946 castro said he was ready to play he feels a whole lot better than he did yesterday
3198947 hes going to take batting practice today and take some ground balls he came out here and did some agility work did some baserunning our training staff thought it would be best to give him another day so thats what well do
3198948 i think young people dont realize that a lot of people put a lot into getting them to where they can have the opportunity to play professional baseball
3198949 mr blair is really a great example of that we have some minority guys on our team guys like wesley wright and michael bourn who got a chance to talk to him and to really find out what he went through it was really special
3198950 there was no stretching just get off the bus and go play
3198951 tape yourself up or get on the next bus back home they didnt have anyone to do that
3198952 if he hit the ball and it hopped two times to the shortstop you threw it back to the pitcher because you sure wasnt going to get him out
3198953 i dont like it but theres nothing you can do about it
3198954 to not face them all season then see them again in september than it would be to play them early and not see them for a long time
3198955 the most important thing is keeping it even in the division
3198956 thats the only place i was before and i was a part of that my whole career
3198957 i even got the chance to pitch in the big leagues with them so its good to see your teammates again but besides that im happy where i am
3198958 i dont have anything to prove to anybody im happy to be here and i thank this team for giving me another opportunity to play the game thats in the past and i wish them good luck i dont need to go there and prove anything to them i dont care about that team anymore im an oriole and im happy to be an oriole
3198959 for me he looks a lot more like what i saw when he was in triple a buffalo
3198960 better mechanics and much better extension on his pitches his velocity is much more consistent his slider at times is very good and at other times its out of the strike zone i think everything is predicated on his delivery
3198961 the good thing is to feel healthy then you can go out there and battle
3198962 i feel great and i just take every opportunity that i have to just do the best that i can i dont want to try to do too much i just want to try to learn from every outing and be the best that i can every time i just want to be ready for every day and help this team the best way i can
3198963 hes a little kind of tender stiff i think its a good day to not play him i talked to him this morning about it a little bit theyve got a lefty hes played a few in a row i think we both thought it was the right day to not play wed like to play him every day because hes such a big threat i think we both thought it was the right day to not play him
3198964 its like a day off without being a day off
3198965 the climate was more bad it was like 90 100 degrees with a 90 percent humidity with the smog it wasnt too good but the facilities were great the baseball fields just looked like our spring training facilities in america the olympic village was great the dining hall was phenomenal no complaints
3198966 from one day i think i was 87 91 mph to throwing 94 95
3198967 pitching got a lot more fun after that because it became easier i didnt have to think as much about changeups and curveballs especially at the lower levels you can overpower people with fastballs
3198968 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3198969 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3198970 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3198971 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3198972 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3198973 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3198974 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3198975 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3198976 whats more points awarded seemed to increase after the blue athlete was digitally transformed into a red athlete and decrease when the red competitor changed to blue
3198977 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3198978 it is merely a rumor started by someone who obviously is miserable in their own skin that they would even have the notion to attack a child
3198979 i dont think i took enough classes reacting to five other people is completely different than being with an acting coach
3198980 im a horrible driver and my first day on set i had to drive a car and act at the same time i was thinking about too many things at once i almost ran over the girl that i was talking to it was just a mess
3198981 there was a long steady cam shot where a young christian bale is coming into this american barracks
3198982 he walks through the whole barracks and gets to the end of the barracks and theres john malkovich and joe pantoliano and me its a six minute shot and then i screwed up my line
3198983 i said oh whoops sorry maybe we should cut steven spielberg is in another building watching on the monitors and i just hear silence then i hear him what happened
3198984 im like i just yelled cut because i screwed up and hes yelling no no you never cut i literally turned white and shrunk because my hero and idol steven spielberg is yelling at me
3198985 i learned you never yell cut as an actor the director yells cut for years i lived with this shame but weve laughed about it since because he remembers it too i was mortified
3198986 there are many things for us to consider and evaluate about the darwin option and which party is in power is not one of those we work with whichever party forms government and more than happy to do so
3198987 we do not involve ourselves in politics and inpex is pleased to work with all governments
3198988 whether its a death sentence or a life sentence at the moment we are glad that there has been a resolution
3198989 i hope that the appeal process will be a lot quicker than the trial process
3198990 given the past track record of this matter it could be years before the appeal is heard or resolved
3198991 georgias reputation and its viability as a safe alternative route for pipelines bringing oil and gas from kazakhstan potentially turkmenistan and azerbaijan to mediterranean markets has been compromised
3198992 the more the fighting extends outside of ossetia into other regions or if the btc pipeline itself gets attacked successfully then that reputational risks and security risks for any operators considering pipeline expansion in georgia will be further elevated
3198993 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries
3198994 there is no definite attempt to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
3198995 there are creepy crawlies in there and apparently they got real dangerous centipedes you think its gonna be a fun video game but real centipedes if they bite you its like getting shot with a bullet its that painful
3198996 you can try to control the jungle but no one could clear all the centipedes the nooks and crannies where they hide are impossible to find
3198997 on the very first day of shooting i was carrying the biggest gun and i had to be running shooting diving with the gun and i landed funny on the gun and i heard something pop
3198998 i bruised my rib and you know how that goes if you get a rib bruise it lasts for about six weeks of not being able to breathe all the way in its such a drag
3198999 i began to see the most clearly i was 31 or 32 and i quit smoking i was so emotional
3199000 i had been so unhappy and i realised that i had just been literally stuffing it back with those cigarettes in my mouth i felt like i woke up suddenly
3199001 all of a sudden just before theres a potential announcement theyre raising last minute issues which quite frankly have been addressed have been discussed
3199002 ive written one so people better go see it itll allow me to make the next one
3199003 im not a moderate person and ill be the first to say there have been times when things were taken to the extreme
3199004 i got really fat i want to take care of myself
3199005 faith and i have joked about doing on golden pond on broadway when we get older
3199006 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3199007 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3199008 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3199009 the line was so long i was like what is this
3199010 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3199011 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3199012 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the rest room
3199013 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3199014 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3199015 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3199016 we got here this morning and it was absolutely clean
3199017 we thought it was going to be destroyed i guess people are really making a conscious effort
3199018 it was a good scrimmage but we still have a lot of work to do on both sides of the ball
3199019 chris hairston has done a good job at tackle he is our best tackle but cory lambert is closing the gap both are starters cory has made improvement over these 10 days coming out of the spring chris was by far our best tackle but cory is getting closer
3199020 andre powell has brought a lot of new things to the table as special teams coordinator he has done a good job in that area this is the first time i have had someone on my staff who was a special teams coordinator before he got here
3199021 and he sticks up 4 fingers in this grandiose power gesture and i say
3199022 happily ever after is a visually inventive and engrossing comedy that makes you feel warm despite its depiction of a series of unluckiness and failures in life
3199023 this is not a story about an unhappy marriage but about a journey of reuniting twin souls overcoming successive hardships and problems with laughter we are very pleased to present this unconventional love story to theatrical audiences
3199024 i feel that that will be good for the governance of the northern territory because it will put pressure on government to provide adequate level of social services within the northern territory

3199032 time warners short sighted decision to abandon netscape shows technology decisions are long term ones and companies that want to create value in that market need to look beyond quarter to quarter earnings
3199033 we were pleasantly surprised that the information we discovered whilst researching velvet assassin originally led some people to discover a gold cache in texas but now that one has been discovered in europe im tempted to pause development to find the rest myself
3199034 it does seem that our research is real and that there are gold bars out there but we are still trying to track how information is getting onto violettesdream com

3199041 a few of these guys is going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3199042 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3199043 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3199044 well continue to monitor the waiver wire but this underscores the emphasis that weve placed on depth we havent gotten to this point on the back of any one player its been a team effort all year and i expect that to continue
3199045 its non displaced which is good news as were looking at it now we dont think it will be too long after that two week period
3199046 whether its three weeks or a little bit sooner than that or a little bit later im not sure
3199047 different things create opportunities you can reflect on the negative part or on the positive of giving these guys opportunities to help this team further our lead in the standings
3199048 thats the way were going to look at it it doesnt do any good to dwell on the other side

3199055 its hard to put that kind of race behind you
3199056 but it sets me up for something good the 200 free final thats my first priority
3199057 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3199058 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane it doesnt matter where you are
3199059 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there
3199060 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3199061 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3199062 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
3199063 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind from ahead it doesnt matter
3199064 he was just a part of it and we were a part of it whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3199065 he tweaked it a little bit in the game did something
3199066 i suppose theres a chance but we havent even talked about it yet
3199067 now look it if you ask matt hell give you the history of his back since he was 11

3199070 no way did he think he was going to be in this position six months ago and now here you are
3199071 who knows he might be the starting center on opening day
3199072 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3199073 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3199074 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3199075 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3199076 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3199077 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3199078 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3199079 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that

3199082 jean pierre gontard y el mediador franc s noel saez han hecho la facilitaci n en un contexto extremadamente tenso sus fines eran puramente humanitarios
3199083 suiza se ha comprometido de buena fe en este proceso a solicitud del gobierno colombiano estamos convencidos de que nuestro facilitador ha trabajado de manera ejemplar reafirmamos que no estuvo involucrado en ning n pago a las farc quisi ramos aclarar las cr ticas contra gontard y estamos dispuestos a cooperar y esperamos que la conclusi n ser positiva
3199084 las relaciones entre suiza y colombia no se resumen a la facilitaci n son muy diversas e intensas y engloban una serie de temas como la econom a con acuerdos de protecci n de la inversi n y otro contra la doble tributaci n y uno m s sobre transferencia de bienes culturales

3199088 en el 2014 los colombianos podamos decir al fin libres
3199089 querido amigo todo lo que yo he dicho sobre el particular lo he dicho otra pregunta
3199090 realmente cinco millones 200 mil firmas son la cifra m s elocuente de lo que piensa el pueblo cualquier congreso del mundo le queda muy dif cil no reconocer esta voluntad popular
3199091 a sabiendas que la ley solo exige cerca de 1 5 millones de firmas para el referendo los promotores se sobredimensionaron recogiendo m s de cinco millones de r bricas de las personas que estar an interesadas en el tercer per odo del presidente lvaro uribe esto demuestra el apoyo que los colombianos tienen a favor del presidente que coincide con el 91 por ciento del apoyo nacional como lo dio a conocer una encuesta de alta responsabilidad en el pa s
3199092 es inconcebible que un pa s que est en un momento econ mico tan dif cil donde el gobierno debe hacer un ajuste fiscal se lance a un esfuerzo sin tener ni idea de cu nto va a costar y sin que el presidente haya aclarado su posici n al respecto
3199093 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive
3199094 when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
3199095 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface
3199096 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker
3199097 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future
3199098 this is so they get more energy going into the trunk and less into unwanted branches
3199099 in agriculture you might be able to avoid pruning by spraying the crop with this compound or using this compound to discover a more active one that could be applied to that species
3199100 its probably the case that were just starting to chip away at these sort of signalling molecules
3199101 finding another one is important to understanding how to find them and what they do and how they all interact
3199102 nearly 80 of plants that you dig up have got this relationship down in their roots with these fungi and that enhances their ability to take up nutrients
3199103 in australia that is important because we have really bad soil and the plants have to work hard to get water or nutrients out of the soil
3199104 this discovery is providing the biosynthetic genes for the compound thats needed to enhance the nutrient water uptake
3199105 the reason this research is important is because in tasmania it was assumed that megafauna had gone extinct before humans arrived this paper shows thats not the case
3199106 this is probably the best evidence weve got for human predation of megafauna
3199107 one of the problems with these guys is they are all dating experts not archaeologists
3199108 the material needs to be placed in context relating to other finds or the sediments they are in
3199109 none of the sites they have examined have any archaeology associated with it so there is no evidence any of these species existed alongside humans
3199110 what they are doing is saying we cant find evidence of climate change therefore it must be humans it could be that there was short term climatic flux or competitive exclusion or a whole range of other things that caused the extinction
3199111 our findings are particularly relevant for neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinsons and alzheimers
3199112 many of these diseases are due to misbehaving or damaged proteins that accumulate in neurons by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
3199113 that was enough to maintain a clean liver and to prove that if you keep your cells clean they work better

3199115 i have large boobs and a sizable a so i guess the title comes with the territory but i just play tennis i always try to look my best even though its hard to look your best when youre sweating grunting and making faces i never look my best when playing
3199116 im attracted to guys who are really athletic so its never a problem to be honest i absolutely hate working out i hate going to the gym i do it only cause its my job and i think about it like ok other peoples jobs are to go to the office nine to five and my job is to go the gym and look sexy thats the only thing that gets me through it
3199117 i love my smile my smile and my cleavage laughs i think they go really well together
3199118 it definitely makes it harder which is not really cool because i
3199119 maybe thats all im taking my wife knows more than i do
3199120 he started coming at me so i pulled out the gun
3199121 i just say im not licensed to pick up here

3199125 it was just so unexpected it was so clear that the french were going to win this race and it was like a switch was flipped and lezak pulled it out

3199129 visual studio 2008 and the net framework 3 5 service pack 1 sp1 is not a traditional service pack which usually consists of bug fixes and performance improvements while microsoft did fix some bugs and dramatically improved performance in several areas cold start up times for wpf applications were dramatically reduced etc microsoft listened to customer feedback and decided to introduce several of the most requested new features into the net framework via a service pack furthermore with sp1 microsoft brought visual studio 2008 into alignment with the new features in both the net framework and in sql server 2008 during the beta release of sp1 in may 2008 we did not conduct proactive press outreach in order to maintain focus on the current releases however with sp1 we had an opportunity to reinforce the value of both visual studio 2008 and the net framework 3 5 and highlight the innovations that are included in the service pack because of the complexity of some of the features in sp1 in addition to briefing industry analysts we held a press tour briefing several tech reporters on the innovations microsoft is bringing to market
3199130 sp1 contains innovations that dramatically improve the performance of managed desktop applications and enable the creation best of breed rich client applications sp1 offers several dramatic improvements to the common language runtime clr including the ability to generate managed code that dramatically improves both application startup time and end to end application execution time and the ability of managed code to take advantage of the aslr address space layout randomization security feature in windows vista additionally managed applications that are opened from network shares now have the same performance and behavior as native applications running with full trust finally sp1 offers dramatic improvements for the creation of rich client applications and line of business lob applications using windows presentation foundation wpf in addition to faster startup times and improved performance for bitmap effects sp1 offers wpf developers directx pixel shader support and the new webbrowser control
3199131 sp1 enables developers to create a broader set of mission critical web services that are more scalable and easier to build

3199134 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3199135 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3199136 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3199137 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3199138 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3199139 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3199140 its logical its logical that we serve the military niche and thats who were all about
3199141 i believe today we are financially strong enough to handle a potential 6 5 million members that come our way
3199142 much more effective and efficient and more technology induced so we can do a lot more things that we were ever able to do five or ten years ago
3199143 well theres two philosophies in a time of recession you can retrench and pull back lay off a bunch of employees and wait for the good times or you can say were going to put our nose to the grindstone here and were going to grow ourselves our of this recession and so were going to continue to look for opportunities improve our business and get better and stronger and thats the approach weve taken

3199146 federal police are scaling up their capacities in the fight against kidnappings with an unprecedented effort
3199147 were proposing a pact a national agreement that sets certain rules and commitments from each of the people involved
3199148 theres no evidence that the increase in kidnappings is related to
3199149 we believe that we need to feel united on this torturous path that has cost so many lives
3199150 the relationship between young men and the police in these hot areas is very difficult
3199151 the police are on edge because when they get out of their cars they dont know what is going to happen the young people are on edge because they feel they are being harassed
3199152 our associates program has a dedicated manager whose job is to help all of our publishers grow their sales we view our publishers as important business partners in fact when our associates come to las vegas we offer to pick them up from the airport give them a tour of our facilities and take them to dinner

3199154 thirty six percent of respondents overall said it is very likely or somewhat likely that federal officials either participated in the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon or took no action to stop them because they wanted the united states to go to war in the middle east
3199155 68 percent of all germans felt the media had not reported the full truth behind the attacks
3199156 one in five canadians believes the attacks on the united states on september 11 2001 had nothing to do with osama bin laden and were actually a plot by influential americans
3199157 majorities in indonesia turkey egypt and jordan say that they do not believe groups of arabs carried out the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks the percentage of turks expressing disbelief that arabs carried out the 9 11 attacks has increased from 43 in a 2002 gallup survey to 59 currently and this attitude is not limited to muslims in predominantly muslim countries 56 of british muslims say they do not believe arabs carried out the terror attacks against the u s compared with just 17 who do

3199163 i think they should hear georgia will never surrender georgia will never surrender
3199164 no matter how superhuman a military you have if you have not been preparing the attack for months and months for gods sake how can you mobilise into another country 1 000 tanks within hours if its not a premeditated attack on a neighbouring country
3199165 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3199166 we will go to the end because we once lost our freedom to russia

3199168 sean told me about this figured you might want to know grant got in a car crash and is paralyzed thats as far as i know if you want more info i would contact sean
3199169 we do not believe the law allows auction sites like ebay to continue to turn a blind eye to this problem while reaping profits from the listing and sale of counterfeit merchandise trademark law does not impose a duty on tiffany to police ebays site ebay designed the site and has the responsibility to police it
3199170 if you look at a retail store the same applies
3199171 once a store owner knows there is a problem with counterfeiting it has a duty to investigate and take action in neither instance is there any obligation on the trademark owner to investigate what is happening on site at the flea market or the retail store yet ebay has set itself up and the district court seems to have agreed that tiffany has an obligation to police ebays site we dont believe that obligation exists in law and we respectfully disagree with the district court decision
3199172 many of georgias internet servers were under external control from late thursday
3199173 use caution with any web sites that appear of a georgia official source but are without any recent news i e sat sun aug 9 10 as these may be fraudulent

3199180 todays internet has come a long way from being just a medium for disseminating information and is now increasingly becoming the mainstream channel for distributing and accessing infotainment content as well
3199181 as faster internet speeds enhance overall online experience users are spending more time online playing games and visiting social networking sites
3199182 growing broadband penetration has created a conducive environment to encourage users to spend more time online engaging in entertainment activities by enabling convenient sharing personalization and sourcing of relevant content
3199183 in a bid to shake off the ghosts of piracy stakeholders are grappling to find the right business model to monetize content
3199184 for selected content particularly online video and music streaming services the ad sponsored revenue model has been widely used
3199185 we would be reluctant to introduce freight charges because they create ill will and introduce unnecessary complexity
3199186 but were probably going to introduce charges for late payment
3199187 customers on 30 day terms will be offered an early settlement discount but if theyre late then the meter starts running dealers know how it is and dont expect you to be an interest free bank
3199188 of course it wont work out like that because it encourages people to pay on time but well still get an upside through not having to chase those payments

3199228 time warners short sighted decision to abandon netscape shows technology decisions are long term ones and companies that want to create value in that market need to look beyond quarter to quarter earnings
3199229 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out

3199233 at the end of the year to be honest with you i didnt know if i was going to come back i needed that time to really think about my future it was a tougher decision than i thought it was going to be at the end of the year its all about whether i feel im ready to go another year thats the biggest thing for me am i prepared to do what it takes to be successful for another year i know how much time you have to put in off the ice because playing hockey is the easy part

3199250 dont buy vanguards total bond market index fund because it contains mortgage backed securities
3199251 this fund is an excellent choice to anchor most investors bond portfolios especially those unwilling to take on substantial credit risk it boasts low expenses broad diversification and experienced management
3199252 compare the growth of a hypothetical 10 000 investment in this fund with the growth of the same amount in up to 2 other vanguard funds and a benchmark to get an accurate comparison choose a time range that covers the number of years all funds have been in existence move your mouse over the graph to see the changes in returns

3199260 this is an important election for all americans but for those involved in agriculture the differences between the candidates is huge we think its important to show our support for the candidate who listens to farmers and understands what it will take to make rural america prosper
3199261 senator obama has a long history of championing the issues that are most important to ohios family farmers

3199269 the california court of appeals has upheld the right of parents to homeschool their children
3199270 it is an important affirmation of one of our most basic liberties as the u s supreme court held more than eight decades ago in voiding a state attempt to prohibit private education the child is not the mere creature of the state education is most fundamentally a parental responsibility and insofar as it is a matter of government policy it should be handled by the state and local governments not the federal government
3199271 there is no need for a federal department spending 68 billion annually and interfering with local and state education policies indeed nationalizing education policy has made it harder not easier for us to properly educate our children as president i will send legislation to congress to dismantle the department of education
3199272 i also will use whatever power i have as president to cut back the departments massive and intrusive bureaucracy and empower parents to use those resources to better educate their children i will reduce as much as possible federal regulation of and control over state local and parental education decision making
3199273 my goal is to eliminate federal involvement which lacks any constitutional basis in education policy across america
3199274 protecting the rights of parents was an important issue for me when i served in congress
3199275 moreover my running mate wayne allyn root is a homeschooling parent the first ever to be nominated for national office
3199276 the california court decision though welcome demonstrates why advocates of homeschooling and private education must be active in their state legislatures as well as congress
3199277 the court said it was deferring to the california legislature which imposed few restrictions on homeschooling the court might not have stood against an overbearing state legislature americas parents cannot take their right to oversee their childrens schooling for granted
3199278 americas educational results have gotten worse as federal funding and control have increased
3199279 its time to reverse the process i will not attempt to be known as the education president rather i want every family to be known as the education family and every parent to be known as the education parent in my administration government will stop usurping the authority of parents as well as local and state governments over education
3199280 we are pleased to report solid operating performance for our second fiscal quarter
3199281 when combined with the farm out agreement that we consummated in the quarter qrcp owns the right to develop more than 122 000 net acres within the recognized fairway of this emerging shale play and more than 7 000 net acres outside the fairway qrcp plans to drive reserve and production growth through the development of this large acreage position and fund the development with the distributions we receive from qelp and quest midstream and existing cash balances in the second half of 2008 we plan to drill up to six wells on our appalachian acreage including up to three horizontal and three vertical wells
3199282 with the petroedge acquisition qelp added long lived natural gas producing properties that are immediately accretive to distributable cash flow per unit add geographic and geologic diversity receive premium natural gas pricing and offer numerous opportunities to complete the existing wells in additional formations with proved developed non producing reserves subject to final approval from its board of directors qelp anticipates the petroedge acquisition and organic growth from its cherokee basin operations to enable the partnership to increase its distribution paid in november for the third quarter of 2008 by an additional 16 and 28 to an annual rate of between 2 00 and 2 20 per unit up from 1 72 per unit currently the planned total distribution increase over the second and third quarters from the first quarter is consistent with the guidance qelp provided in conjunction with the closing of the petroedge acquisition
3199283 quest midstream has the right of first offer on gathering and processing of qrcps and qelps production and this acquisition provides quest midstream the opportunity to build a significant presence in appalachia quest owns 85 of the general partner and a 36 limited partner interest in quest midstream
3199284 we believe the future for quest is bright as we continue the low risk development of our large acreage position in the cherokee basin while building a new core area of operations in the appalachian basin we look forward to developing our sizeable acreage position in the basin and further illustrating the benefits of our unique structure
3199285 we are pleased to report solid second quarter operating results that are within our guidance ranges and allowed for continued high coverage for our increased distribution in the first half of the year we successfully drilled 243 gross wells and connected 183 gross wells in the cherokee basin out of the 325 gross wells planned for the year we plan to have all 325 cherokee basin wells drilled by the end of this month and to spread the connections over the remainder of the year production from our oil producing property in seminole county oklahoma that we acquired in the first quarter continues to exceed our expectations and we plan to begin drilling our first new horizontal well on this property in the third quarter
3199286 on july 11 2008 we completed the purchase of natural gas and oil producing wellbores and related assets in the appalachian basin from quest resource corporation
3199287 on august 15 2008 we plan to pay a quarterly distribution of 0 43 per unit which is 7 5 higher than the level indicated at our ipo in november 2007 subject to final approval from qelps board of directors we anticipate our appalachian acquisition and organic growth from our operations in the cherokee basin will allow the partnership to increase its distribution paid in november for the third quarter of 2008 by an additional 16 and 28 to an annual rate of between 2 00 and 2 20 up from 1 72 currently the planned total distribution increase over the second and third quarters from the first quarter is consistent with the guidance we provided in conjunction with the closing of the appalachian basin acquisition

3199294 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3199295 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3199296 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3199297 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3199298 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3199299 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3199300 the u s should work with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline

3199318 jordan is getting a lot more snaps because jarrett is watching

3199320 what we are doing is working on get off time and working on getting the ball out of the punters hands it probably affected how they punted this morning both guys josh jasper and brady dalfrey are really in the thick of it both guys are competing well and i wouldnt be surprised if both didnt punt at times

3199323 this is after all a democratic country but if he violates the civilised culture of society in demonstrating his view then we cannot condone it
3199324 we can respect the dif ference of opinion but it is the behaviour in expressing the opinion that we dis agree with
3199325 a lawyer and member of parliament who claimed to be representing all the muslims
3199326 the police failed to control the situation but instead appeared to collaborate with some of the demonstrators who wanted to force their way into the hall to stop the forum
3199327 it is sad that there is no room for civil and rational discussion in this matter
3199328 theyre a great tool to have to help keep your vehicle secure and id recommend that those who dont have one get one
3199329 id also encourage all vehicle owners to be vigilant with their keys
3199330 each stolen car is factored into car insurance premiums and hits the hip pocket of every driver
3199331 its tremendously difficult to hot wire a car thats fitted with an engine immobiliser
3199332 we will continue to address the issue of irresponsible and illegal driving offending seriously
3199333 those caught repeat offending will be dealt with accordingly with these recent incidents highlighting our intentions
3199334 the community has to understand that the reality is we cant have a mining boom which is going to grow our region like has never been seen before and provide jobs for our children and grandchildren without having some of the impact of the boom on our doorstep
3199335 council has resolved to gather further information on the proposals for point lowly
3199336 our council has formed a task force with community and government representatives to work together towards a solution that is acceptable to both parties
3199337 while council feels for those directly affected by the proposals we need to look at the development from the broader perspective of the benefits they will bring to the community
3199338 none of us wants to return to the challenges we faced last decade of working tirelessly to attract new business and jobs to our cities
3199339 step by step were neatening up the presentation of the school
3199340 country rosa is a local company and offered to complete the works for a very fair price and they would be available at all times so we decided to go with them and they have been absolutely fantastic
3199341 it took the guys a week to finish and were very happy with the result
3199342 we got involved with the tree planting day and planted about 60 trees down the side of the school which were donated by the whyalla city council
3199343 it took about two months to clean all the rubbish from around the school and its already looking much better
3199344 theyre afraid of everything but wont listen to the exsplanation
3199345 by your number of posts ill assume youre not trolling here
3199346 what do you like about living in the us especially about living in texas arizona nevada or connecticut
3199347 theyre the perfect size kind of like baby beefeater tomatoes
3199348 firstly it is less intimidating than haemodialysis especially for children as there are no needle pricks in haemodialysis there are two pricks each time three times a week there are also no big machines with blood flowing through them as in haemodialysis
3199349 secondly it can be done at home and at a time convenient to the patient unlike haemodialysis which is mostly done in hospitals
3199350 lastly it allows more liberal food and fluid intake when compared to haemodialysis
3199351 infection in peritoneal dialysis patients occurs commonly in two forms exit site infections as in infection by skin organisms around the place where the catheter exit from the abdomen and peritonitis which is infection of the membrane lining the abdomen this is the membrane where the exchange of waste products in the blood vessels takes place with the fluid that is infused both these infections are treatable and do not mean that patients have to switch to haemodialysis patients are switched only when the infections cannot be treated
3199352 patients need to be fully aware of their options for treatment so they can have the quality of life they deserve even with their illness this shift from in centre haemodialysis therapy to home based peritoneal dialysis therapy is a positive step forward in treating end stage renal failure patients as treatment becomes more accessible to those afflicted with kidney disease
3199353 hey ladies buy an hhr and youll get mobbed by pervy looking guys at every stoplight

3199361 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3199362 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3199363 i can lock you up without evidence and you wont see a lawyer for two years
3199364 when i was in the math club we always used to say dont judge a geek by his glasses
3199365 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3199366 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3199367 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3199368 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3199369 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3199370 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3199371 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3199372 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3199373 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3199374 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag

3199379 he means by which the entrepreneur creates new wealth producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth
3199380 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3199381 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3199382 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3199383 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3199384 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3199385 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3199386 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3199387 there must be pockets of residents that have some kind of a characteristic that is contributing to a higher infant mortality whether thats substance abuse or something else
3199388 i just cant tell you because we havent done that specific of an analysis
3199389 see if there is anything that might suggest an environmental exposure
3199390 the parents knew this was going to happen but said we want to get to know her before she goes

3199403 associations that represent the music industry should not hurl barbs at each other if one is not happy with the state of the industry and how other players work then give suggestions on how to improve things instead of resorting to a blame game
3199404 we have never commented on karyawans goings on as it would be interfering in its affairs similarly we would like to remind him not to interfere in ours
3199405 failed to bring up the local music industry in the last decade
3199406 the figure was an estimate which we deemed achievable at the seminar and it can be done if everyone in the music industry works seriously towards it
3199407 i strongly feel that fernandez is a credible figure in the industry and he should be more supportive of efforts to make it grow
3199408 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3199409 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3199410 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3199411 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration
3199412 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
3199413 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not
3199414 i would say that we mostly were focused elsewhere unlike during the cold war when wed see a single soviet armor battalion move so yes the size and scope of the russian move has come as something of a surprise
3199415 while their utility in country may be very limited removing them might inadvertently signal to the world that we are abandoning our ally which we most certainly are not
3199416 brazilian libertarians guilherme inojosa from the brazilian libertarians is currently in the uk and members of lpuk will be meeting guilherme today south america is an area of the world that rarely appears on the uk political horizon
3199417 guilherme belongs to an association of libertarians across brazil who met up across the net sounds familiar unfortunately it is an uphill struggle to form a libertarian party in brazil we think we are hard done by to register with the state is far more expensive than we paid the state plus you have to have one hundred founder members it is only when you have obtained five hundred thousand signatures from the citizens of brazil is the party allowed to be recognised and stand in elections

3199429 when talking about physical exercise as part of a weight loss programme experts have recommended exercises that go on for at least 30 minutes
3199430 in reality this is not enough the level of activity should be more than that

3199445 when i voiced my opinions people started labelling me as emotional and irrational hey ive been in the industry for nearly three decades and i would be mad if i defy any efforts to spur the growth of the music industry
3199446 what im disappointed with is the lackadaisical attitude of certain quarters who prefer to talk and not act accordingly some even dare to portray a negative image about the industry to the government
3199447 some of these associations have been dormant for many years while others are non cohesive in their management and ethics im uncertain if they are legal or if they are relevant for the industry

3199450 over the years karyawan has done its part in assisting the members who have been plagued with problems but some associations have failed to come together with karyawan to sing a more unified tune to tackle issues on a more confident note

3199455 these are places nobodys gone before in essence so this is a first step
3199456 i always have gone where the most creativity and freedom have been available
3199457 its available at two places at the top of show business if you make absolutely mindless mediocrities that sell a zillion dollars or at the dawn of new media where you can do interesting things and then all of a sudden the guys come in and say wait a minute these are the rules and then its time to leave

3199462 but lifes not fair so its never going to be about that at the end of the day it happened and it seems that the sooner we can come to grips with that and process it the better off were going to be
3199463 the stabbings cast a shadow on the olympics coming a half day after a spectacular opening ceremony in a city where violent acts are rare especially against foreigners it embarrassed the chinese government
3199464 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence theres no indication here of any premeditation or anything
3199465 it seems just unfortunately a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3199466 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3199467 clearly elisabeth is a victim in this as well obviously she physically was unscathed having to deal with this has been hard for her she has shown incredible strength the last couple of days weve been able to talk through it
3199468 obviously its a lot of tears and a lot of hugs

3199470 that was very meaningful to them and i hope a very good sign

3199485 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3199486 previously there were people who believed the megafauna were wiped out by humans alone those who believed it was climate change alone and the majority believed it was a combination of the two
3199487 these animals disappeared very very quickly and while climate could have led to their waterholes drying up forcing them into closer contact with people the vegetation and climate in tasmania have in fact remained stable
3199488 we believe it was an imperceptible overkill of the adolescents of these incredibly slow producing animals that finally knocked them on the head
3199489 wherever prehistoric people arrived in new zealand australia north america they made a mess of things just like the later colonisers did
3199490 it was the same in the case of the tasmanian tiger by the time they realised they needed to save the species the last one was dying in hobart zoo
3199491 it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3199492 this is my debut on television as a host since i have experienced the format of the show i feel i can empathise with the housemates and would be able to relate with the participants who will have no connection with the outside world for about 85 days it will be entertaining show with a human touch

3199494 its the same thing ive been doing from the beginning
3199495 the only thing is they havent been catching my ball thats it when i was hitting in the 090s i was doing the same thing when i hit 340 in 2004 i was doing the same thing i havent changed a thing i knew i could do better if my body feels good
3199496 i think its just feeling stronger and feeling a whole lot better coming back from those three days off
3199497 he looks a lot more like the player we saw the first few weeks of spring training when he was hitting everything and catching everything running real good

3199501 no sabemos quien hizo los ofrecimientos pero obviamente son personas interesadas en mantener a dar o por fuera de la situaci n y de su foro natural que es la pol tica pero estoy seguro que debe relucir la verdad y las pruebas son contundentes
3199502 i felt he really was so committed to that character the guy that was playing that guy that as an audience you bought his sincerity very few people i think could pull that off
3199503 robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle
3199504 to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what hes doing is crazy the whole time
3199505 otherwise its just demeaning to brandons character and if its demeaning to an actual black man in the movie i would have run for the hills
3199506 if were all gonna play ball lets all play ball
3199507 i believe in fairness if we can punch you punch back and funny is funny
3199508 this sort of self important self involved thing seemed funny to me
3199509 i just couldnt figure a way to make that into a movie
3199510 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3199511 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3199512 you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think youre doing of what you think is the right idea
3199513 if people are accepting it the way that you intended and you feel that from a general audience then stand behind it
3199514 i just hope at this point with whatever little weve done to brand ourselves as entertainers that you give us a little slack

3199518 the myth of a chistian nation how the quest for political power is destroying the church
3199519 do not think i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them
3199520 abraham believed and it was accredited to him as righteousness
3199521 i am the lord your god who called you out of egypt therefore be holy for the lord your god is holy
3199522 losing my need to pretend creating a culture of authenticity
3199523 the most important work of spiritual leadership is leading a spiritually authentic life but to do this i must break through the deception that i aam somehow better than others that i am some how a little less in need of gods mercy and grace than the tias and jims of the world
3199524 for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god
3199525 authenticity is hard work it always works from the inside out it begins with the inner life of the leader being authentic with god it manifests itself in a personal vulnerability before others as an intimate connnection with god displaces the fear of transparency
3199526 leaders cannot afford to pretend were something were not we must be in community where it is safe to be real before its too late where we can be reminded that our value and worth comes from who we are in christ not what we do as christians only then can we lead toward a culture of authenticity
3199527 creating a culture where people are free to be themselves warts and all is the soil in which gods spirit causes growth authenticity breaks down the trust barriers keeping our generation from pursuing faith
3199528 but authenticity can be dangerous if left alone if you create a culture where people will rip it open and let others see the dirt and grime of your life but you have not created a culture of acceptance where grace abounds youre setting people up for a great letdown
3199529 no perfect people allowed creating a come as you are culture in the church
3199530 when a culture of dialogue gets created people far from god who do not typically trust christians feel safe enough to hang out and explore a culture of dialogue allows people to put down their guard and seek and as they truly seek just as the lord promises they will find him
3199531 notice that even though jesus had all the answers he still respected and valued the opinions of others though he proclaimed truth with authority he did not force his truth on others in love he offered what they needed and then was willing to let people disagree and walk away even though it saddened him
3199532 creating a culture of dialogue means letting everyone know its okay to be in process
3199533 how can we welcome doubt if our goal is faith first we must realize that doubt is not the antithesis of faith all of us have our doubts because our knowledge is imperfect and incomplete we must be willing to be honest about our doubts
3199534 questions doubts and stuggles are not the antithesis to faith the opposite of faith is a decision not to trust god when leaders come to terms with this interchange between doubts and faith then we find freedom to create a culture of dialogue
3199535 creating a culture of dialogue does not mean you never confront wrongdoing or challenge people with truth it means you respect the will and opinions of the other person you seek to listen as much as you speak and you encourage where you see the work of gods spirit and at times when you sense the promptings of gods spirit he will nudge you to confront or challenge when he does it is your repsonsibility to not hold back speaking truth but to speak it in love
3199536 leaders must challenge the assumption that all emerging post christian seekers are the same in how they look act or think theyre probably the most diverse generation ever nevertheless many seem to struggle with issues of trust
3199537 creating a culture for dialogue is really about trust its not only about creating a climate where skeptical cynical generations can trust its first about you as a leader trusting gods spirit to lead and guide you as you interact with people valuing listening encouraging positive trajectories at times challenging boldly but respecting and loving all peole as the father does despite their response and remember that in the end their response is gods business
3199538 losing my need to pretend creating a culture of authenticity
3199539 what if we all said no to over processed food
3199540 no to food thats not fit for our kids and yes to real
3199541 here chloe have another tablespoon of mayonaisse mmm its so pure and not overprocessed
3199542 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for
3199543 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3199544 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3199545 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then

3199555 as i said to the boys in the locker room its just how the game goes sometimes
3199556 you have to handle it right and not get your heads down
3199557 we have some unfinished business and well go into wednesdays game against nigeria fully prepared any result other than a loss will give us a pass to the quarterfinals maybe we should have taken care of this business on sunday but before this game i dont think anyone gave us a chance to play the game like we did against the european champions lets not forget about that
3199558 nigeria might not be as technical as the dutch but their athleticism and the quality of players that they have is pretty good
3199559 were definitely looking out for them and i obviously think its going to be a tough game for us to win but we thought that about sunday as well
3199560 freddy and michael will not play but as ive said from the beginning its all about the group
3199561 the 18 players weve chosen have to be up to the challenge
3199562 all were in suport of the land and water conservation fund

3199568 they had us pinned down on the 1 yard line and i was supposed to run a quarterback sneak to the a gap
3199569 i remember him from 1994 when the chargers were in the super bowl i was 11 and just going into middle
3199570 to make the decisions that weve made about him to insert him as our no 1 was a big step for us and for him weve put a lot of faith in him

3199577 when youre in sports youve got to find a way to manage the media there are reporters there every week its part of the territory a lot of professional athletes look at it that way
3199578 i was in a cab in las vegas and the driver asked me what i did for a living
3199579 i said i play football he looked at me in the rear view mirror and he recognized me it turns out he was a big fan of the bills
3199580 buffalo has a small town feel just like los gatos
3199581 but people follow football much more you go to a restaurant go to the mall people know who you are thats another adjustment you always have to put your best foot forward
3199582 youve just got to handle it the right way put yourself in that persons shoes
3199583 i feel like im still just trent around here when im in los gatos or at stanford
3199584 he was in the gym for one of shelbys volleyball games running around with all the other kids
3199585 then i see him throw a ball the length of the gym
3199586 the summer before my freshman year coach scott downs came by my house he had been my t ball coach
3199587 i played volleyball as a freshman and at the end of the year cattolico wanted me to train for football
3199588 i was barely 170 pounds and maybe 6 feet and every guy on that team was huge the only guy i could lift with was cattolico it was kind of embarrassing
3199589 in my sophomore year i worked in there and we went 11 1 and lost in the central coast section semifinals
3199590 i guess he saw something in me i didnt notice it i was just playing and having fun
3199591 i told the seniors that year heres a guy youve got to take care of
3199592 i remember a night when we were over scouting wilcox and in walk our football players eight of em and then here comes little trent
3199593 we walked back into the locker room and wrote remember mitty on the board we didnt lose another football game for three years
3199594 wed been practicing this play all week long to run against wilcox
3199595 it wasnt open and there was a heavy rush but he finally got the ball away
3199596 we hadnt thrown deep all season it was early in the fourth quarter and he had called another play it was one of the only times i ever said anything he stared at me for a long time and i knew if i didnt complete this pass i was never going to call another play
3199597 i came back to the sidelines and he made some comment like nice throw
3199598 we were playing leigh in my junior year and coach lives in the leigh school district the main point of his talk before that game was that if we lost he wouldnt be able to get up the next day and go out in his driveway to get his morning newspaper
3199599 it still never hit me that id play college football
3199600 i was invited to junior day at ucla and i didnt even know what a junior day was
3199601 the head coach brought me in they gave me courtside seats at a basketball game and they said they wanted to offer me a scholarship then a couple of weeks later i went to junior day at stanford
3199602 i narrowed it down to three stanford ucla and michigan
3199603 i wish we could have won more games and gone to a bowl game and i wish wed have beaten cal but i have no regrets
3199604 its hard to talk poorly about stanford youre surrounded by so many gifted people whether academically or athletically
3199605 my roommate didnt know who played in the big game he didnt even know where the stadium was
3199606 i finally got him to come to a game but he left at halftime he had to do a problem set
3199607 and then there was the day i was sitting in class we were talking about imperial china and i looked over at the guy next to me hed been on jeopardy the night before

3199637 victor and his clinically obese friend of 10 years talked about everything from finances to relationships but when she sat down and broke his brand new couch it became obvious weight was the one subject theyd never discuss
3199638 while friends tell friends and loved ones to stop smoking drinking shopping and even sleeping around addressing a friends weight remains taboo
3199639 when the weight gain hit 50 pounds she broke her silence
3199640 i thought if im not going to tell her who will
3199641 id want her to tell me so i sat her down and told her ive noticed her weight gain it was a tough conversation but ultimately for the best

3199913 there would be no unification if muw moved forward with its name change
3199914 this regime of representation has naturalized woman as image beautiful to look at defined by her looks
3199915 the role of woman in the iconography of art nouveau
3199916 even more zealously patronized as a fragile helpless object used in a decorative and literal sense to adorn the household
3199917 permits a woman to be judged not on the quality of her work but primarily on her appearance
3199918 it cant be because the season is going to be a lot tougher
3199919 weve got to come out here with a lot more energy and a lot more excitement
3199920 when youre young its hard to get excited and encourage your teammates when all your trying to do is taking care of yourself
3199921 thats something that we havent had to coach in the past well learn form that too were going to coach everything were going to coach energy and excitement and enthusiasm
3199922 weve just got to execute our offense better it sounds pretty simple but weve just got to get more completions and move the ball down the field just be a little more smooth about everything
3199923 i grew up with the street fighter games i dont see them as cheesy or funny but as serious characters that deserve to be explored in their own right

3199946 its basically an elongated triangular pyramid we three live at the respective corners forming the smallest triangle and the frog kings throne is at the pointiest apex
3199947 its interlocking dodecahedral orbit is a result of being located in a constellation of 12 stars as for why we arrived in japan we did not really choose japan the warp drive did not really sure why except that maybe it was easier since japan is not quite on earth itself or maybe it was just an identity thing where the warp drive chose a warped destination
3199948 i wish i didnt have to walk any further i like the sound of the leaves rustling i wish washing dishes werent so boring and the soap werent drying out my skin
3199949 the warm water is in unison with the detergent and is currently washing away the plates grime the sun is shining through the window and casting an ever greater shadow on the dishs white ceramics
3199950 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
3199951 but the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that
3199952 they both have the intellectual ability and the maturity to form judgments about important policy issues id feel comfortable with both of them in there as president
3199953 they are not people who are just preening for the cameras theyre both celebrities but theyre the rare breed celebrities who are actually interested in getting things done
3199954 he definitely has the ability to work with people of the other party but he also i felt showed a willingness not to give away the store which would have been my principal concern
3199955 i thought this is going to be a guy im going to enjoy working with over the years because he knows when to hold em and when to fold em
3199956 hes a very good legislator from my point of view because when he gets onto something he doesnt just want to introduce a bill he likes to move it and hes fearless
3199957 people couldnt believe how long we stayed on mccain feingold wed come to those press conferences year after year and you guys would laugh at us i mean literally
3199958 hes a great guy to fight an uphill battle with legislatively he keeps his word i probably shouldnt be saying this stuff but to be honest about it it was one of the better professional experiences ive ever had in my life
3199959 unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago
3199960 changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
3199961 he does seem much more tight and less fun than he was in the 2000 campaign i worry for his sake though im supporting his opponent that his handlers are constraining him too much
3199962 its unfair because mccains a blast hes fun to be around hes certainly young in spirit hes actually very young in energy
3199963 yes he shows temper but he burns fast and he doesnt let it cloud his judgment he would not be a loose cannon in the oval office
3199964 its not like hes going to pick up the red phone in a rage
3199965 darwin gives us a far more empirical way of talking about human nature than through stories like the original sin
3199966 it explains our frailties our addictions our infidelities and other moral deficiencies as byproducts of adaptation over billions of years and that dowd says has a potentially liberating effect never mind guilt once we understand our sinful ways we can get past them and play a conscious role in the evolution of humanity
3199967 i think the physical change in my body was so strong that it completely overpowered any moral teachings and religious beliefs i had
3199968 many of the core doctrines central to christianity sin salvation the kingdom of god heaven and hell jesus as gods way truth and life
3199969 nasib akan membawamu untuk bersama tetapi untuk tetap bersama sampai akhir itu tergantung dari dirimu sendiri
3199970 he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and treated others with contempt
3199971 admonish the idle encourage the fainthearted help the weak be patient with them all
3199972 all changes even the most longed for have their melancholy for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter another
3199973 okay lets go for it lets get this one and make it work
3199974 most other olympics acquired their label during or after the games usually after emotions had coalesced or a big news event pushed other stories off the front page but the combination of fascination with china and increasingly intense churn of media attention has changed that
3199975 ill be over there if you want to talk to me later
3199976 e i miei condizionali e i miei mondi utopici mi stringono la gola come una morsa mantenendo la dolcezza di una carezza una prigione dolce e ingannevole ingrassata di autocompiacimento e fiducia in me stesso tutto falso ovviamente prova di questo la velocit con cui passo dal sono stata giorni interi a cucinare con una vecchietta ottantenne che aveva la seconda elementare e sapeva parlare solo in dialetto stretto mi raccontava delle cose mi diceva della sua vita scherzava e rideva con me quando ho capito che stavamo comunicando quando ho percepito che tra di noi si era formato un legame stato uno dei momenti pi felici della mia vita
3199977 i have witnessed incidents where he has used profanity at colleagues and exploded at colleagues
3199978 he would disagree about something and then explode it was incidents of irrational behavior weve all had incidents where we have gotten angry but ive never seen anyone act like that
3199979 the senator explained that he had already committed to support george bush
3199980 mccain said f you and never spoke to him again
3199981 he has a lot of support around the country but i dont think he has a lot of support from people who know him well
3199982 mccain called the guy a sh head the senator demanded an apology mccain stood up and said i apologize but youre still a sh head that was in front of 40 to 50 republican senators that sort of thing happened frequently
3199983 nearly all the republican senators endorsed bush because they knew mccain from serving with him in the senate they so disliked him that they wouldnt support him they have been on the hard end of his behavior
3199984 you know the french remind me a little bit of an aging actress of the 1940s who is still trying to dine out on her looks but doesnt have the face for it
3199985 a presidential candidate is not supposed to talk at length and on the record about the rules he broke or the strippers he dated or the time he arrived so drunk that he fell through the screen door of the young lady he was wooing
3199986 the candor tells you more than the comment and reporters sometimes just decide to take him off the record because they dont want to see him flame out and burn up a great story
3199987 national reporters may genuflect but local journalists cringe at the thought of covering mccain better known in arizona for his short temper refusal to take calls and attempts at media manipulation than for the straight talk he doles out
3199988 here is where the true strength of the character of the person not his past accomplishments will determine whether his presidency ends in accomplishment or failure
3199989 do i get angry when i see pork barreling and wasteful spending absolutely
3199990 what has struck me about mccain is that everybody underestimated the ability of his advisers and him to hypnotize the national media because most of us in the media in arizona thought of him as a guy who had a terrible temper occasionally had a foul mouth a guy who whined and pouted unless he got his way
3199991 mccain has a temper that is bombastic volatile and purple faced sometimes he gets out of control do you want somebody sitting in the white house with that kind of temper
3199992 hold it a minute somebody write down everything this guy has to say you know what we need to record him its best to get a liar on tape
3199993 senator if you have a problem with me why dont we go out in the hallway and talk about it
3199994 theyve been treating you like a princess in phoenix while theyve been burning me over this dam deal and im sick of it
3199995 i was standing around talking to about a half a dozen postal workers id worked real closely with
3199996 you could tell he was so angry he was white
3199997 he turned back to me and said im so glad youre out of a job and ill see that you never work again
3199998 i didnt raise my voice didnt offer any disparaging remarks or insults
3199999 if you do not cooperate on this project youll be the shortest tenured forest supervisor in the history of the forest service
