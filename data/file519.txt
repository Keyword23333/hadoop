5190237 dominantie is iets dat moet je overlaten aan honden die werken voor hun verzorger
5190238 zou jij het over je heen laten gaan als iemand doet alsof hij veel beter en geweldiger is dan jij terwijl hij dat niet is
5190239 jullie mensen zijn toch heel anders jullie zien dat toch niet
5190240 baasjes zijn baasjes zij geven ons eten en niet omgekeerd dat maakt toch meteen al dat je als hond weet dat zij meer kunnen dan wij
5190241 wat een rare hond is dat dat is toch niet normaal
5190242 nee dat is niet nodig mijn verzorgers kennen mij heel goed
5190243 wat mij meteen opvalt is dat kelly zich terughoudend opsteld ze heeft niet meteen vertrouwen erop dat mensen haar ook goed gezind zijn als ik naar de reden van dit gedrag vraag krijg ik slechts terug dat ze het in het verleden zwaar heeft gehad ik krijg hierbij ook meteen een gevoel van pijn mogelijk door fysiek geweld door ze is erg ongelukkig geweest dit wil haar af en toe nog wel eens in een soort depressie laten schieten
5190244 toch is ze niet een hondje dat over zich heen laat lopen ze kan best met andere honden maar als ze zich op een bepaalde in haar mening irritante manier opstellen maakt ze er snel korte metten mee door een korte afsnauwing dit gedrag heeft ze duidelijk geleerd in de periode nadat ze het zo zwaar heeft gehad ze kan beter voor haarzelf opkomen
5190245 om de een of andere reden krijg ik zelf de indruk dat ze niet uit nederland komt kelly zelf geeft daar echter geen antwoord op
5190246 ze komt over in de eerste instantie als een beetje een timide hond echter ze heeft hele uitbundige momenten waarin ze zich opsteld als een pup met de kolder in de kop ze doet een beetje als een jong lammetje in de wei gekke sprongen maken enz ze voelt zich dan echt zeker en veilig anders durft ze het nog niet goed ze moet vaak aangemoedigd worden om iets te ondernemen uit zichzelf is de stap soms echt nog te groot
5190247 kelly hoeft niet per definitie het middelpunt te vormen als ze maar geaccepteerd wordt en men maar rekening houdt met haar dat is voor haar al heel wat
5190248 kelly houdt er wel van om geaaid te worden het liefst gooit ze zich meteen op haar rug zodat men haar borstkas meteen lekker kan kroelen er is een bepaald plekje dat ze heel erg fijn vind als men haar daar kroelt dat zit aan de zijkant van de borstkas net even in de buurt van de oksel ik zie in spiegelbeeld dus ik ga ervan uit dat haar rechts in mijn beeld eigenlijk haar linkerkant is op de foto is het dat plekje dat net die driehoek vormt van haar oksel poot naar haar borstkas net even iets meer naar achteren toe lastig uit te leggen
5190249 ze heeft moeite gehad met mannen zegt nu zelf dat ze daar voor een groot deel overheen is
5190250 ik vraag aan kelly of er nog iets speciaal is dat we moeten weten van haar

5190327 at some point people arent going to consider themselves insured if theyre at risk for a huge amount out of pocket just because they have one disease rather than another

5190650 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website

5190654 la afici n me llega desde peque o desde que un d a pas delante del televisor cuando mi abuelo estaba viendo una corrida y me llam mucho la atenci n despu s l gicamente se dieron otras circunstancias para que yo entrara en este mundo siempre por afici n eso s pero aquel fue el primer contacto no recuerdo qui n toreaba ese d a en la tele pero s me acuerdo de que la primera vez que fui a una plaza toreaban joselito enrique ponce y jos tom s y esa corrida fue la que me termin de enganchar despu s el toreo es una forma de vida m s que una profesi n hay profesiones en las que apartas la vida privada la personal de la profesional pero en sta no sta te involucra mucho y hace que todo gire en torno a ella por eso es distinta a las dem s
5190655 el miedo es algo que est ah que nace contigo lo que hacemos nosotros es que somos capaces de trag rnoslo y enfrentarnos a l y ese miedo se supera s lo dando siempre un paso adelante teniendo muy claro lo que vas a hacer estando muy seguro confiando en ti y estando dispuesto a arriesgar y a lo que sea el miedo te lleva a una situaci n en la que no se pondr a casi nadie el valor es precisamente tragarse el miedo y ser consciente de que te puede pasar algo pero lo asumes y te pones ah y gracias a tus conocimientos lo intentas llevar mejor
5190656 la sensaci n de cuajar un toro dura poquito son apenas 10 minutos lo que viene despu s es como una especie de nube en la que te sumerges pero lo bonito es cuando est s delante del toro lo cuajas y hay una comunicaci n con l hay faenas con algunos toros en las que est s completamente abandonado y pr cticamente es como si estuvieras toreando de sal n el toreo tiene muchas cosas bonitas y muchas muy duras pero esos momentos de compenetraci n con el animal son al final la recompensa a todo
5190657 la familia es la que te ha echado para adelante la que te ha dado de comer cuando no pod as subsistir por ti mismo pero se vive para ser importante uno y para ser figura del toreo la familia no puede ser algo que te ate tienes que tener capacidad de abandonar todo lo que pueda atarte a la vida y para ser torero tienes que tener valor para eso tambi n para poder vivir sin algo que realmente necesitas yo cuando toreo no sufro por nadie soy muy ego sta y me gusta vivir yo las sensaciones y no me preocupo realmente por quien hay fuera no me acuerdo de nadie despu s de la corrida eso s mi primera llamada es para mi hermano o para un amigo y despu s s llamo a mi madre
5190658 el toro es un animal al que amo y respeto y sobre todo conozco muy bien mejor que otras personas que creen defenderlo mejor de lo que lo defiendo yo convivo casi todos los d as del a o con l me s todas sus reacciones y eso hace que me sienta muy identificado con l la muerte del toro hay que entenderla como la vida misma todo acaba as todo tiene un principio y un fin todo acaba igual como acabamos todos la representaci n es as y adem s algo tan fuerte como es el toreo tiene que acabar de esa manera no puede terminar de otra forma
5190659 el d a que toreas los momentos duros van por rachas el miedo va y viene en los momentos de soledad de la habitaci n siempre piensas que puede pasar algo que te puedes equivocar t o se puede equivocar el toro pero lo normal es pensar en positivo eso es lo que te da fuerzas para vestirte y pensar en disfrutar cuando est s en una habitaci n y sabes que tienes cualidades que puedes dominar al animal eso es de lo m s bonito que existe tienes un miedo esc nico y un miedo f sico pero no te puede
5190660 el torero necesita la soledad para vivir adem s muchas veces cuando est s rodeado de gente te sientes solo entiendo que tambi n es dif cil pedirle a alguien que te comprenda por eso hay ocasiones en las que aunque est s con gente hablando y ri ndote por dentro hay un vac o interior que es lo que te provoca la soledad pero se aprende a vivir con eso cada uno lo lleva como puede pero debo reconocer que m no me disgusta esa soledad es una forma de buscar el equilibro para mantener todo ordenado y saber lo que quieres
5190661 cuando las cosas salen bien y todo el mundo te alaba es bueno saber que haces algo distinto y que lo llevas dentro pero tampoco hay que creerse nada el que es grande no llega nunca a creerse nada y no est re ido el creerte algo con el seguir evolucionando lo que s es cierto es que lo mejor del toreo es el toro y lo peor la mentira como en todas partes ste es un mundo en el que se mueven masas y dinero y por lo tanto hay mentiras como en todos sitios pero aqu sobran porque si el toreo es distinto tiene que ser distinto para todo la verdad del toreo est en el ruedo de barreras para dentro

5190672 we are pleased to be able to continue to accretively invest in modern well located distribution facilities in our target markets the high occupancy levels of these facilities reflect continued occupier demand across our european markets given current challenging credit market conditions pepf iis ability to access new debt underlines the strong business relationships prologis and pepr have with the global banking community
5190673 we must start with a single code and a single set of standards otherwise we will end up with different monitoring for different standards
5190674 that is why the professional bodies have already set up the industry standards board
5190675 if we are not careful we will end up with each local authority setting and implementing its own rules its own monitoring practices and its own cost structures
5190676 we have seen this already with housing health and safety standards this legislation exists but in many areas has already failed due to lack of action by the local authorities
5190677 the internet is now being used as a medium for everything from accommodation bookings to research on zymology
5190678 new uses are added daily and it makes sense for companies to have website visibility and function at the heart of their international marketing strategy
5190679 it does cost more to adapt products and services for international markets however in an increasingly global economy the one size fits all option no longer works as a corporate strategy

5190709 rong chhun president of the cambodia independent teachers association cita riot police armed with batons shields and tear gas to crackdown on hundreds of people who had gathered for a trade union led march against alleged thai incursions near preah vihear temple
5190710 the tension has eased considerably there is no more confrontation
5190711 this riot or demonstration could cause disorder and bigger problems because in the past illegal demonstrators burned down the thai embassy making the government pay tens of millions of dollars back to thailand they should travel to encourage soldiers at preah vihear temple it is better they should not demonstrate in the city center

5190726 wenn eine minderheitsregierung sich eine mehrheit sucht wobei es meistens wohl nur um ein paar monate oder wochen geht kann man nicht sagen ihr d rft nicht f r uns stimmen
5190727 wenn es feste spielregeln gibt wie die dass eine oppositionspartei bei misstrauensantr gen gegen die regierung nicht mitstimmt dann ist das f r mich sehr koalitions hnlich und ich h tte an koalitions hnlichen zust nden kein interesse
5190728 wir verleugnen nicht die inhalte sondern es ist die art und weise wie die strache fp mit den inhalten umgeht man kann diskutieren ob der islam politisch t tig sein soll auch ber die trennung von staat und kirche aber mit leuten die wie die fp im grazer wahlkampf menschen und religionen herabw rdigen mag ich nicht an einem tisch sitzen
5190729 es geht um die frage wie sollen wir reagieren wenn wir in die situation kommen dass wir nach dem nein der iren ein drittes mal etwas zum abstimmen bekommen so wie wir beim eu beitritt eine volksabstimmung hatten und so wie wir mit dem koalitionspartner vp im falle eines t rkei beitritts eine volksabstimmung vereinbart haben so wollen wir auch eine volksabstimmung bei einer weiteren ratifizierung wenn die iren den vertrag ratifizieren ist die sache erledigt wenn aber auf der basis von nizza ein neuer vertrag vorgelegt wird treten wir sozialdemokraten f r eine volksabstimmung ein

5190732 success is not final failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts
5190733 yeh yeh i understand i know what you are talking about
5190734 look at the candidate and say does he live with integrity service with humility share with generosity or not
5190735 they were very different in personality in philosophy in direction in goals and in vision and theres nothing wrong with that
5190736 it was a powerful forum in that we were exposed to the soul of who these two men were
5190737 before this i only got what pundits wanted us to hear issues of character issues of value you dont usually hear those types of things
5190738 it gave us a chance to compare and contrast how they could handle things in different situations
5190739 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god
5190740 theyre saying im totally self sufficient by myself and nobody is self sufficient to be president by themselves its too big a job
5190741 campaign 2008 is starting to feel like a sunday school bible drill
5190742 i dont see what good it will do for the american people to again hear the candidates spout pious platitudes about their favorite bible verses or how devout they are
5190743 why should one of these important events be orchestrated entirely by only one pastor who comes out of one narrow segment of our diverse country
5190744 a lot of people misjudged our motives and why we were trying to do this as a church and how we were doing it
5190745 afterward so many did say that this has the potential to change the climate of the election
5190746 it was good to have that kind of civil discourse with the candidates
5190747 it was a courageous step for rick warren that he stepped out and asked questions that represented us
5190748 he solidified for me what i thought he was about
5190749 who in their right mind would ever date someone like me
5190750 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his team mates and his supporters

5190772 and its the first time weve won a relay two olympics in a row were working toward our goal of becoming the no 1 swimming team in the world
5190773 the young ladies at this meet are certainly the best swim team in the world
5190774 i still feel like one of the younger people on the team even though im 20 now
5190775 i always looked up to libby and leisel and now i dont feel any different from them

5190903 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health
5190904 in some ways mental illness is the final frontier of socially acceptable discrimination
5190905 can you imagine the public uproar if mental health was replaced with race gender or religion
5190906 these figures show clearly the insidious stigma still associated with mental health and mental illness
5190907 these are the attitudes that have kept mental health on the outside for far too long
5190908 these findings indicate that the worrying trend of have and have not patients continues
5190909 ensuring canadians have access to a family physician is a key area for action

5190913 es bringt wenig wenn jedem das tolle model oder der tolle spot in erinnerung bleibt sich aber niemand an das produkt oder die marke erinnern kann
5190914 manchmal geben sich werber mit einem teilerfolg zufrieden wenn sie einen ansprechenden spot gedreht haben und fragen sich nicht kann man das noch optimieren ich m chte doch eine erinnerung einen handlungsimpuls ausl sen und nicht nur ein positives gef hl beim betrachten des spots

5190921 our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions rising input prices skills shortages and the further devaluation of the u s dollar
5190922 strong global demand for resources continues to provide cost challenges for the whole industry this is mainly due to rising prices for inputs such as diesel steel making coke and explosives and shortages of skilled labour
5190923 gold rebounded mainly on technical short covering it may rebound above 800 looking at the dollar and oil
5190924 gold and other metals have recovered a bit but its still early to say they will recover continuously gold and oil prices are still in a downward trend
5190925 gold and precious metals have been oversold and the pace of falls was clearly too rapid gold is gaining some support with end users also showing demand on price dips
5190926 active sell offs may slow but a rapid recovery is also not expected as there is plenty of selling interest if gold rises back to around 850

5190943 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

5190957 i was in high school when she hit it big
5190958 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good

5190964 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
5190965 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
5190966 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
5190967 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now

5191033 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5191034 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5191035 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5191036 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5191037 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5191038 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5191039 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5191040 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5191041 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5191042 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5191043 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5191044 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5191045 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5191046 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5191047 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5191048 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5191049 isla het is nog veel te vroeg je moet nog slapen
5191050 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5191051 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5191052 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5191053 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5191054 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5191055 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5191056 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5191057 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5191058 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5191059 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5191060 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5191061 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5191062 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5191063 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5191064 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5191065 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5191066 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5191067 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5191068 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5191069 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5191070 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5191071 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5191072 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5191073 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5191074 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5191075 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5191076 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5191077 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5191078 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5191079 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5191080 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5191081 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5191082 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5191083 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5191084 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5191085 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5191086 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5191087 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5191088 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5191089 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5191090 but it really didnt kind of get on the front burner until sometime within the last seven days
5191091 deadline must have been earlier than the decision than when we started to get serious about making the decision
5191092 in an irony sure to set blogger hearts beating giddily the film graces the cover of ew s new fall preview issue
5191093 ew and warner bros share a parent company but they clearly do not share you know important information
5191094 you know ive been thinking about this mr hand if im here and youre here doesnt it make it our time
5191095 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5191096 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5191097 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5191098 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5191099 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
5191100 you have value on the ground more than you spent
5191101 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
5191102 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
5191103 schlie lich sind viele riester rentenversicherungen so teuer dass die kosten die staatlichen zulagen bersteigen
5191104 es kann doch nicht sein dass der staat die versicherungswirtschaft alimentiert
5191105 riester sparer sollten unbedingt einen blick auf die kosten werfen bevor sie einen vertrag unterschreiben
5191106 banksparpl ne sind nat rlich deutlich g nstiger als versicherungen
5191107 fondssparpl ne bieten sich vor allem f r junge sparer an
5191108 bei den meisten vertr gen liegen die j hrlichen verwaltungskosten bei rund 1 5 prozent
5191109 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5191110 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5191111 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5191112 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5191113 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5191114 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5191115 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5191116 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5191117 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5191118 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5191119 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5191120 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5191121 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5191122 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5191123 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5191124 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5191125 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5191126 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5191127 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5191128 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5191129 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5191130 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5191131 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5191132 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5191133 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5191134 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5191135 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5191136 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5191137 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
5191138 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
5191139 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
5191140 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
5191141 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
5191142 huge sigh of relief on the part of the voters
5191143 when we had pick a party my office and county auditors received a huge amount of complaints and gripes
5191144 we are hearing nothing which is an indication that people are satisfied its been a remarkable change
5191145 reduces the value of information of who is a democrat and who is a republican
5191146 it will be the beginning of the end of her campaign
5191147 ternyata banyak manfaatnya juga hape ini kalo gitu kok malah dilarang sama sekolahan
5191148 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5191149 he should tender his resignation pack up his bags and go
5191150 whatever little moral authority was left has now been completely eroded
5191151 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5191152 this is an issue that is not on the table
5191153 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5191154 the coalition forces invaded afghanistan and we know that women are very important to the forces that invaded afghanistan
5191155 our women and common people are important to us too about one month ago the coalition forces attacked a wedding in jalalabad that killed 49 people women children men boys everyone that was present
5191156 to take revenge on the coalition forces and foreign people and to show the world that our people are just as important as yours
5191157 traditionally badal or revenge has been one of the mainstays of the pashtunwali code or the way of the pashtun
5191158 so its not at all surprising to me that the taliban would use revenge as justification for the killing of the aid workers
5191159 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children
5191160 events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
5191161 this letter is a disgusting attempt to justify the deliberate killings of innocent civilians there is no justification for these killings by the taliban
5191162 canada is in afghanistan at the request of the democratically elected government of that country canadians are part of a un sanctioned nato led coalition that is attempting to bring stability and security to the people of afghanistan we will continue to fight for these goals we will continue to protect the afghan people from these ruthless killers
5191163 the occupation of afghanistan so that the afghans are not killed with your hands and so that you are not killed with the hands of the afghans
5191164 they have to know that the canadian forces under american command handicap tens among the afghan people every day to this kind of condolence and they kill in addition to men numbers of women and children as well
5191165 rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america your government did not take into account the national interests of canada and did not follow a neutral policy it sacrificed its national and international respect and standing in service of the interests of america
5191166 this is not a problem for us because this man is the same slave of the foreigners
5191167 we dont care about raufi we are not happy but we are not worried about this if the foreigners send more soldiers we dont care they have sent many brave commanders to fight us but we dont care
5191168 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5191169 russia wont leave georgia for weeks and it will never withdraw from abkhazia and south ossetia
5191170 they will create every kind of diplomatic language to stay there
5191171 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5191172 the two visions are the same but why are the people so much healthier and happier in heaven
5191173 in heaven the people have learned to feed one another

5191178 doctor i dont know what was in those pills but the problem is worse im passing gas just as much and theyre still soundless but the problem is worse im passing gas just as much and theyre still soundless but now they smell terrible what do you have to say for yourself

5191182 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country
5191183 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
5191184 if you set the bar at half a million youre talking about the top 1 of taxpayers if you think about the last eight years those are the folks who have benefited the most
5191185 give me a specific number is it 100 000 dollars is it 50 200
5191186 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
5191187 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
5191188 any notion that russia was the kind of responsible state ready to integrate into international institutions
5191189 i think that the whole world is looking at russia through a different set of lenses the longer they take to get out and to observe the cease fire thats been declared and the arrangements that have been worked out i think the greater those consequences will be
5191190 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
5191191 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
5191192 what we see as do many around the world is a global economy that is difficult
5191193 when energy and oil prices go up on top of inflation and healthcare and core food items theres a great deal of pressure on the customer
5191194 investors may read this negatively and will want to better understand if the company is being overly cautious or the outlook has slowed
5191195 if the outlook has slowed i view that as bad news for all retailers

5191217 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5191218 the victims were all poor labourers and civilians this was a barbaric act carried out by the enemies of afghanistan at a time of celebration of independence
5191219 these reports indicate that the enemies of the people of afghanistan intend to attack civilian military and government targets during afghan independence celebrations
5191220 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behaviour to security forces afghan or coalition and government representatives
5191221 let us shun tribal linguistic and regional issues and wage jihad against the enemies of this country and its religion and their mercenaries so we can mark the independence anniversary in its actual form
5191222 this is an issue that is not on the table
5191223 the close up finals were at 11 00 all six did a commendable job but shawn farquhar and marc oberon were clearly the best clift and i both voted for oberon all six will get some gigs out of this so they should all be very pleased
5191224 shawn farquhar canada house favorite presented his now legendary signed sealed and delivered card in card case effect followed by the fantastic cups amp balls routine in a manner that only shawn can present a roller coaster from start to finish that saw another standing ovation for the performer in his trademark purple suit

5191227 we shot the video at alis studio on a chroma set screen and then later printed over one thousand images from the video stills i think they were about one thousand and six hundred stills in totality then what we did was we scanned each print back onto the computer and developed the video from the prints

5191273 a quarter of them think theyll end up living for some significant period in a country other than america
5191274 i asked our waitress about her own limits on what she would reveal
5191275 my boobs she answered not terribly demurely but only on halloween and only for my friends
5191276 well im your friend today but tomorrow i might not be can you stop me from sharing your um breasts with the rest of the world or with the company youre hoping will hire you
5191277 but so many of us do this in one form or another that employers are just going to have to adjust or they wont have anyone left to hire

5191295 what peanut decided to make the new toll 2 75 who carries around 5 cent pieces
5191296 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
5191297 it was hard to convince helen to make this documentary
5191298 but when we found the talented rory kennedy we had made a match sort of a match made in heaven
5191299 it was in like 1960 and thomas was covering jackie and the family primarily and she wasnt covering my uncle yet
5191300 and so her editor called her at 3 a m and said you know we just got this news that carolines hamster died and she said you have to call white house press secretary pierre salinger right now and find out if this is true and so thomas didnt even think about it
5191301 she picked up the phone and she called pierre salinger and she said is it true is it true caroline kennedys hamster died and pierre salinger was like helen its 3 oclock in the morning are you insane youre calling me about this stupid hamster and you know she heard about that for a good long time

5191318 es ist absolut nicht mister faheys job zu empfehlen wer dabei ist und wer nicht das ist sache des ioc

5191327 this is a very unusual case with some history to it
5191328 her ex partner has been harassing her over the past year and her children have been targeted
5191329 we cannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun his is no more humane while his education has been sadly neglected
5191330 hes kind of acknowledged as the individual that founded the specialty of healthcare law
5191331 hes been a real driver and force in the industry
5191332 thousands of healthcare cases and clients almost single handedly creating a legal specialty that is now so highly populated by busy lawyers he joked about having his own personal alumni association
5191333 when he started practicing in 1940 there was no specialty of healthcare law
5191334 it was lawyers who served on boards of directors of hospitals who did the work pro bono now for example the national health lawyers assn has grown to 10 000 members
5191335 hospitals were represented like churches it was pro bono work because of the amount of time i spent on it i established the pattern of being paid for it
5191336 you only had a relatively few hospitals back in those days back then you didnt have organized medical groups or integrated medical groups you didnt have medicare or medicaid
5191337 it was just a hell of a lot simpler back then now a hospital has every legal problem that a business has plus a medical staff which complicates things very much
5191338 without his leadership our members certainly would not have the same rich specialty in which to earn their living and contribute to society
5191339 healthcare is a cause at least it became a cause for me and thats the way most people in this industry feel its really been a great career
5191340 we cannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun his is no more humane while his education has been sadly neglected

5191354 it is petty that instead of concentrating on academic work students want to spend more time on entertainment they are just jokers
5191355 we know that some of these criminal acts are as a result of peer pressure to ensure that students are groomed into responsible citizens teachers parents and the communities require tough corrective disciplinary measures enforcement of discipline in schools and homes should be carried alongside counseling if the young are left to do whatever they want they will stray totally
5191356 children no longer value the primary aspects of their lives like education they value secondary things like discos watching video and pornographic images this is wrong and it should not be encouraged
5191357 some of these grown up children today might soon tell us that they have the right to share beds with their parents
5191358 if a school allows students to watch tv throughout the night then it has ceased to be a school it is a commercial entertaining place for adults
5191359 i have to get away from this town it killed my father and it has almost killed me besides the desert is too hot and i cant do anything but dream of a girl
5191360 im sorry about your father how has it almost killed you my brother
5191361 i hallucinated for days i dreamt about a girl the one who haunts me now the girl in the dream was in africa somewhere i dont know where on the plains she had an abortion performed on her by doctors of the cdc the center for disease control they were dressed in white lab coats the horizon was soaked in a heavy orange dusk that settled like a coat of rust
5191362 a monstrous white animal like fetus was placed on her chest i was on morphine heavy doses of that and phenobarbital antibiotics and valium as the doctors thought i was about to die i was on a gurney a few days before the dream i thrashed about i lunged at people i begged my girlfriend when i was awake to kill me and goddam her she wouldnt and now that we arent together she haunts me
5191363 i would say thank god if i believed in any god
5191364 well the doctors were about to give me the anti venom they say they only give the anti venom to those they think are about to pass
5191365 not many people did and the irony of it is that my father was himself bit by a poisonous spider only ten years prior i wasnt there but from what i understand he was about to die himself before a miracle of god saved him can you believe it his liver was almost gone and all of these dreams
5191366 i cant believe it but what is it that youre running from
5191367 we all want to run there so come take care of you there is a girl too you mentioned her she is the tall one such a beautiful girl with the bright green eyes right
5191368 yes were not together yet we live under the same roof i love her but i need to leave because she is really a ghost that haunts me now
5191369 thats not healthy here at the university my ex is here and i am filled with pain every time i see her it is difficult she is like a ghost too

5191372 the sutro baths were opened to the public as the worlds largest indoor swimming pool establishment the baths were built on the sleepy western side of san francisco by wealthy entrepreneur and former mayor of san francisco 1894 1896 adolph sutro the vast glass iron wood and reinforced concrete structure was mostly hidden and filled a small beach inlet below the cliff house which was also owned by adolph sutro at the time both the cliff house and the former baths site are now a part of the golden gate national recreation area and operated by the united states national park service a visitor to the baths not only had a choice of 7 different swimming pools one fresh water and six salt water baths ranging in temperatures but could visit a museum displaying sutros large and varied personal collection of artifacts from his travels a concert hall seating for 8 000 and at one time an ice skating rink during high tides water would flow directly into the pools from the nearby ocean recycling the 2 million gallons of water in about an hour the baths struggled for years mostly due to the very high operating and maintenance costs and eventually closed all that remains of the site are some cement walls blocked off stairs and passageways and a tunnel with a deep crevice in the middle the sutro bath ruins are open to the public but a warning sign advises strict caution as visitors have been swept off by large waves and drowned at the site
5191373 we started seeing a major spike in endorsements about june 1

5191376 we were in ramp up phase we had staff in place and needed to bring more staff on board weve got a very carefully designed work plan and its one of those conversations well be having
5191377 you dont want to waste money on delay you have to be mindful of that and mindful of legislative directions and timelines
5191378 those are the kinds of things that go into considering whether something that is exempt from the freeze or not
5191379 you can blow on the tube or shoot it with a bottle or you can throw it
5191380 every day we make two or three types of things

5191383 you do it at an angle instead of straight and it will work
5191384 everything is set for the champions trophy to be held in pakistan and the icc fully supports our security plans and planning it is only a few players who are grumbling and their concerns are emotional pressure not based on reasoning or logic
5191385 i would advise these players to not be stubborn and behave sensibly
5191386 the icc and its member boards are satisfied with our security arrangements and foolproof planning and there is no reason for not having the champions trophy in pakistan
5191387 the value of the impact from our advertising campaign with park has increased by 10 fold
5191388 we were told that if you get knocked down then you get straight up again
5191389 i think everyone had the same upbringing its something they drum into everyone from an early age
5191390 my father would have a fit if i did any of that stuff
5191391 theres a sense of fair play in the womens game you want to compete but with fair play
5191392 its been like that from the very beginning when i started playing
5191393 its something you take pride in this is the way the game is played
5191394 the mens game is so different its much faster theyre much stronger its much more physical
5191395 our goal was to get a medal in every relay and we achieved that
5191396 and its the first time weve won a relay two olympics in a row
5191397 the australian team of emily seebohm leisel jones jessicah schipper and libby trickett defended their title in the 400 medley relay on the final day of the meet sunday moments before michael phelps captured his record eighth gold as a member of the americans 400 medley relay victory in the mens competition
5191398 the young ladies at this meet are certainly the best swim team in the world
5191399 i still feel like one of the younger people on the team even though im 20 now
5191400 i always looked up to libby and leisel and now i dont feel any different from them
5191401 im just going to take some time and see it certainly lights a fire and it would be nice to continue and do london for the 200
5191402 im going to do all the things that were banned before the olympics
5191403 if we measure by gold medals we didnt achieve our goals
5191404 we got close to the americans in the relay yesterday and each of those american guys got individual medals
5191405 all of our guys are still young and can already race pretty good
5191406 in dry conditions such as dry grasses low fuels low humidity with the possibility of lightning
5191407 non girarti dallaltra parte non arrenderti al dolore non cercare di nasconderti anche se stanno urlando il tuo nome non chiudere gli occhi non spegnere la luce mai dormire mai morire
5191408 however seeking advice and getting a personalised illustration before committing to an equity release product is absolutely essential so its quite concerning to see from the research that so many people dont know where to go for guidance
5191409 its being treated like every other proposed project in the city
5191410 thats going to be really detrimental to los angeles because we pump in hundreds of millions of dollars here
5191411 i mean were talking about planting trees and donating t shirts for kids
5191412 we have to maximize our earnings during this difficult period

5191414 there is always a dip in the fall but this is more than usual
5191415 international carriers who some thought were insulated from these problems are now facing the same situation as the domestic carriers
5191416 its definitely a threat to the local travel and tourism industry

5191419 pengalaman terburuk saya alami di sekolah itulah yang paling menyakitkan buat saya karena sering dihina teman teman bahkan oleh seorang guru saya tidak mau makan di sekolah akhirnya saya ke sekolah hanya untuk ujian dan lalu pulang ke rumah saya tidak dapat mengatasi tekanan yang begitu besar dari lingkungan saya juga mengalami stres yang konstan
5191420 ketika orang menyebut saya gemuk itu justru memancing saya makan lebih banyak lagi itu tidak membuat saya terpacu untuk menurunkan berat badan
5191421 lalu ketika saya sedang menghadiri pesta keluarga dan ada seorang teman berhasil menurunkan 15 kilogram saya menjadi terpacu selain itu ketika datang ke toko pakaian di mana tempat itu satu satunya yang bisa dikunjungi karena memiliki stok berukuran besar ternyata ukuran terbesar di toko itu pun terlalu sempit saya lalu berpikir saya hanya akan punya baju bila memesan khusus atau saya tidak akan bisa keluar rumah dan pergi ke luar untuk bermain dengan teman itulah titik baliknya
5191422 bagian tersulit buat saya sebenarnya bukanlah menghentikan makan tetapi mengakui bahwa saya punya masalah dan harus bergabung dengan kelompok ketika anda masih muda dan ketika anda seorang pria yang mengikuti kelompok pelangsingan itu merupakan hal yang cukup menakutkan
5191423 anda harus secara bertahap mengikuti program anda cukup berolahraga lima menit kapanpun sempat di hari itu lalu terus membangunnya sepanjang waktu dan sekarang saya berjalan hingga lima mil setiap malam dengan ibu saya
5191424 jika saya boleh menitipkan suatu pesan janganlah berhenti untuk berpikir selamanya
5191425 saya kira hal yang paling buruk adalah stres dan anda dapat menghindarinya dengan cara mengatur kehidupan anda

5191427 pemilihan batu yang berbeda itu juga lebih dikarenakan semakin banyak pilihan batu yang bagus dari luar negeri
5191428 setiap batu punya karakteristik yang berbeda ini akan berpengaruh terhadap perawatan di kemudian hari
5191429 perawatan rumah dengan desain seperti ini cenderung simpel dan maintenance nya murah karena hanya perlu di coating secara teratur
5191430 batu alam eksterior butuh coating yang lebih sering dibandingkan yang interior
5191431 bahkan terkadang dicoating tergantung kondisinya saja kalau tidak terlalu rusak lebih baik dibiarkan dulu agar lebih natural
5191432 warna batunya akan semakin gelap seperti wet look jadi perubahan warna itu harus dipersiapkan agar keserasian warna pada desainnya tidak melenceng

5191457 theres something different down here and its hard to identify what it is when the most common language you hear is cantonese
5191458 people can feel like strangers in their own country so thats where the night market comes along it really showcases the culture
5191459 we need to not make it so isolated and insular
5191460 that needs to happen for economic reasons too you cant keep pulling from your own
5191461 we really wanted the night market to stay about all the senses
5191462 the food really is representative of the community and the district not food you can get at any street fair
5191463 i was expecting it to be bigger and better but the performances were good and they get an a for effort
5191464 i didnt even know what i was coming to so i thought wow this is interesting
5191465 then people go oh i feel a little more understanding of the community it doesnt feel quite so alien
5191466 we want to remove the mystery but leave the mystique
5191467 what we can say publicly versus what we really feel are oftentimes totally different we just have to leave it at that
5191468 it makes the stress level in this thing it makes it huge
5191469 we dont have a choice but to believe in their legal system
5191470 we will take this as far as we have to take this because she is walking out of there totally free of anything related to this
5191471 one of the things edda and i talked about with amanda before she even went to italy was what happens if something goes wrong your parents are now 6 000 miles away from you what do you do
5191472 at that point we were thinking about you know medical
5191473 she said mom im ok im home but i think somebody might have been in my house

5191484 taking down the roof of the tunnel ended up being a lot easier than they expected
5191485 several years ago we tried to do the plastic or aluminum recycling but people werent as educated as they are now it just plain didnt work
5191486 now so many more people are aware of it that they will look for the bins to drop items in
5191487 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5191488 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5191489 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool

5191497 he saw so much of it he accepted it as part of life
5191498 he didnt answer so i looked over and he had died during the night
5191499 so i punched the guy on the other side of me and said hey this guy over here is dead there wasnt any motion over there either so i looked over on the other side and he had died during the night too
5191500 on one occasion we posed this question to a parking enforcement officer who would only offer the advice i wouldnt park there but who couldnt tell us if the merchants actions were legal
5191501 this is not only an inconvenience it is depriving the city of revenue
5191502 there are a few intersections on this road and the signs that tell me which way to go are buried in the trees
5191503 can we either get these signs moved to the other side of the road or the trees pruned to make those signs readable
5191504 this is a busy time for maintenance crews and the project will be scheduled as quickly as possible

5191506 its nice to give stuff but that takes 20 minutes then bingo youre on vacation
5191507 to make the trip and pay for my own airfare and for everything and donate more than 5 000 in medical supplies if thats not a humanitarian trip i dont know what is
5191508 anyone storing data on an unfamiliar ftp server needs to encrypt and sign it to ensure reliable protection against prying eyes and external manipulation duplicity is just the tool for this and the ftplicity script from ct magazine makes working with it childs play
5191509 and most importantly for licences such as the gpl it means that your rights to use the copyrighted work at all disappear
5191510 the lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration
5191511 for example program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge
5191512 attractiveness of free software and open source distribution models for both software developers and it vendors
5191513 for the community this wasnt about money at all but about receiving the blessing of an important court that the foundations upon which the entire free and open source and creative commons philosophies are based
5191514 basically people are coming in and buying on the dip
5191515 we have seen a heavy sell down in the last three or four weeks and people now think its little overdone
5191516 oil prices also fell to the lower end of the recent trading range on friday so some traders in the market probably saw that as a buying opportunity
5191517 we are still looking for declines in broad terms this year and next year
5191518 copper and aluminium will probably be the strongest of the base metals and those that are most suitable for substitution hardest hit
5191519 the early bird may get the worm but the late rising worm lives
5191520 saya bukan melarikan diri daripada membayar hutang along tapi mereka along nak saya mati
5191521 saya terpaksa meminjam wang daripada along kerana terdesak membayar hutang saya pernah menjadi penjamin untuk beberapa rakan kongsi dan bila tiba masa mereka tidak membayar hutang berkenaan saya menjadi mangsa
5191522 hutang saya hanya dalam lingkungan rm30 000 hingga rm50 000 tetapi kerana jumlah bunga yang tinggi maka hutang saya menjadi hampir rm300 000
5191523 i just wanted to qualify i tried to keep the race clean and keep everything in control and that is what i did
5191524 the time was nothing great but it was about qualification before i start to pick it up
5191525 i have raced against robles a few times and you know he is always going to be quick but i didnt notice him in the race i was just trying to take care of my own business and i am happy to qualify
5191526 it is a brilliant atmosphere and a fast track but its not a fast track if you hit a hurdle so i was just trying to keep it clean
5191527 we arrived in the olympic village on august 16 and took an mri and the problem was in his tendon
5191528 since athens his main goal was to achieve gold in beijing
5191529 todays result was not perfect for all of us and especially liu xiang he has been under great pressure and expectations from all of us
5191530 the end of the tendon on his right foot the point where the tendon is attached to the bone
5191531 it is very close to the heel on his take off foot so there is a lot of pressure on that area that caused the problem
5191532 i think everyone in the country will be very disappointed
5191533 i dont think it was a case that he was under too much pressure he is very courageous and he had an injury
5191534 i crossed the line and i assumed he was there but i looked across and he wasnt and i was amazed
5191535 i never realised in the warm up i just assumed he was ready to go
5191536 when you see the crowd the birds nest was packed you realise why he had to come out
5191537 wir wissen schon lange dass freie radikale aus dem tabakrauch eine verheerende wirkung auf den k rper haben
5191538 aufgrund unserer untersuchung wissen wir dass auch partikel die in der luft entstehen lebensgef hrlich sein k nnen
5191539 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5191540 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5191541 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5191542 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5191543 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5191544 baggo biking beads basketball balloons bouncing bubbles balls and brownies
5191545 so ill stand with arms high and heart abandoned in awe of the one who gave it all
5191546 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5191547 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5191548 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5191549 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5191550 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5191551 r tteg ngen ber r ju inte l ngre oss som klubb
5191552 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5191553 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5191554 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5191555 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5191556 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5191557 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5191558 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5191559 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5191560 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5191561 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5191562 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5191563 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5191564 who are open to doing something on the production side
5191565 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5191566 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5191567 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5191568 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5191569 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

5191572 dont look for anyone to blame perished climbers deserve respect
5191573 you mustnt put blame on anyone mountain climbing demands making decisions and sometimes these can be the wrong ones but at 8000 meters is very difficult to evaluate the situation there have been many false comments published about the ones who died they were all experienced climbers and we all expose ourselves when climbing people who perished on k2 deserve respect not frivolous accusations
5191574 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5191575 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5191576 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5191577 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5191578 you werent buying a house you were buying a package
5191579 they werent disclosing any of this that was on separate paper that was pulled
5191580 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5191581 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5191582 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5191583 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5191584 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5191585 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5191586 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5191587 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5191588 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5191589 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5191590 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5191591 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5191592 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5191593 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

5191596 whitewash exposing the health and environmental dangers of womans sanitary product and dsposable diaper what you can do about it
5191597 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5191598 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5191599 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5191600 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5191601 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5191602 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5191603 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5191604 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5191605 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5191606 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5191607 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5191608 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5191609 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5191610 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5191611 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5191612 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5191613 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5191614 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5191615 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5191616 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5191617 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5191618 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5191619 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5191620 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5191621 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5191622 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5191623 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5191624 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5191625 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5191626 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5191627 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5191628 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5191629 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5191630 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5191631 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5191632 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5191633 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5191634 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5191635 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5191636 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5191637 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5191638 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5191639 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

5191643 carting organic waste to landfills contributes to several problems it requires using garbage trucks which spew pollutants in addition mixing food waste into garbage can make it more difficult for sanitation workers to sort out recyclables and more energy is required to incinerate the water laden refuse and most importantly landfills themselves produce a lot of methane a potent greenhouse gas
5191644 sending food waste through a kitchen garbage disposal however creates a different set of headaches it increases water usage slightly according to several studies engineers worry that as the waste passes through municipal sewer systems to treatment plants the ground up food sometimes contributes to clogging and after treating the waste water plants are left with more sludge which is costly to dispose of
5191645 i feel particularly angry on behalf of early onset patients because it feels like an insult and the younger you are the more insulting it is

5191663 i thought it was cool when i was younger i had short hair but i got tired of always having to style it i wanted a hair do that was easy to take care of and looked the way it was supposed to when i woke up in the morning thats why i let my hair grow and got dreadlocks
5191664 i dont want to change anything about myself i think that everybody should be the way that they want to be and noone needs to change anything about themselves

5191670 vermoedelijk wir lieben euch en eigenlijk maakt het niets uit de jongens verstaan het toch wel kort voor het eigenlijke optreden hebben wij de vier backstage gesproken de kans om close bij jongens te komen bestaat vooral bij tom
5191671 de andere drie jongens hebben in elk land waar we tot nu toe zijn geweest nog niets gedaan in geen enkel land hadden ze een vriendinnetje ze hebben berhaupt niet iets met meisjes gedaan terwijl ik dat al wel over de hele wereld heb kunnen doen het is best lastig om een conclusie te trekken maar je kunt zeggen dat ik overal wel aan mijn trekken kom
5191672 de jongens hebben wereldwijd succes en niet alleen bij vrouwen dat bewijzen de fotos van parijs in maart los angeles in mei en die van gisteravond in rome de overwinningstocht van de magdeburger is ongelofelijk je zou daarom toch gaan denken dat er inmiddels flink wat geld op de bankrekening staat
5191673 op dit moment heb ik nog geen miljoen op mijn rekening staan de mensen die echt het grove geld verdienen zijn natuurlijk de platenmaatschappij als je veel geld wilt verdienen kun je beter voetbalspeler worden
5191674 miljonairs zijn ze kennelijk nog niet maar van het welbekende jetset leven krijgen ze inmiddels alles mee bijvoorbeeld inmiddels verliezen ze het overzicht en weten ze niet altijd even goed waar ze zich op het moment op de aarde bevinden
5191675 of vanavond een van deze dames tom heeft geholpen duidelijk te maken waar hij zich op dit moment bevind zal hij waarschijnlijk maar al te graag de volgende keer willen vertellen
5191676 ik heb geen principes omdat ik er moeite mee heb me aan die principes te houden
5191677 hij is geen goed idool maar hij is een ongelofelijk goede bassist

5191683 apparently her beauty really is only skin deep gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child

5191704 hopefully the process is to spot things that would be grist for the funny mill
5191705 in some respects the heavier subjects are the ones that are most loaded with opportunity because they have the most you know the difference between potential and kinetic energy they have the most potential energy so to delve into that gives you the largest combustion the most interest i dont mean for the audience i mean for us everyone here is working too hard to do stuff we dont care about

5191758 the political conditions must be created so that this humanitarian socio economic situation in zimbabwe is addressed as a matter of urgency by an inclusive government
5191759 it is critical that we conclude negotiations as a matter of urgency because people are suffering
5191760 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5191761 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5191762 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5191763 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5191764 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5191765 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution

5191809 its unlikely im not saying it couldnt happen but its unlikely
5191810 is getting a feel for where carpenters at because if it doesnt look like carpenter is going to be ready then you have to think about wainwright as a starter

5191827 this behaviour is inappropriate but the spanish athletes involved have apologised formally to china for the photograph and the matter is now closed
5191828 we did it because we came to china we dont want to do anything bad for chinese people or asian people
5191829 we think maybe we took a bad picture but we never wanted to offend anybody we didnt see it as a racist gesture

5191845 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
5191846 failure to rapidly and completely implement the accord would have serious consequences on relations between russia and the european union

5191950 no hay ninguna normativa especial prevista para el caso de los terroristas
5191951 en principio no parece necesario porque esas penas ya existen aunque nada impide que se pudieran alargar o crear otras nuevas
5191952 el c digo penal de 1995 estableci que las medidas de seguridad s lo se pod an aplicar a personas inimputables o imputables parcialmente como por ejemplo personas con enfermedades mentales por lo que aplicarlas tambi n a terroristas o violadores ser a una modificaci n m s profunda
5191953 siempre se puede hacer pero tengo dudas de que pueda ser obligatorio para este tipo de delitos parece descabellado porque muy pocos terroristas reinciden al salir de la c rcel lo que lo convertir a en innecesario en esos casos perder a el sentido de vigilancia para convertirse nicamente en una pena adicional encubierta
5191954 tanto el c digo de 1973 como el de 1995 contemplan la posibilidad de que el condenado por delitos graves no se acerque al lugar de residencia de la v ctima durante cinco a os la pregunta es por qu los fiscales no la pidieron en el caso de juana
5191955 la obligaci n legal de las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad es vigilar a todo el que sea potencialmente peligroso aunque sin controlar su correspondencia sin pincharle el tel fono es decir respetando sus derechos fundamentales
5191956 en caso de que esa vigilancia se establezca con car cter general se estar a sometiendo a estos delincuentes a libertad vigilada lo que supondr a en realidad otra pena
5191957 crear una nueva pena de libertad vigilada como pretende el pp que obligue a controlar a todos los etarras que hayan cumplido esos per odos de c rcel tan prolongados parece absurdo son medidas que de aprobarse s lo se aplicar an pasadas varias d cadas mientras que los condenados por el c digo de 1973 seguir n saliendo
5191958 parece l gico desde la legalidad y t cnicamente se puede hacer pero los etarras que salgan de prisi n pr ximamente podr n establecerse donde quieran porque nada se lo impide
5191959 los de libertad personal la libertad de residencia la intimidad y la igualdad
5191960 aunque ninguno puede ejercerse ilimitadamente todos se pueden ver restringidos m s all de lo que la constituci n permite
5191961 ser a una especie condena perpetua que puede atentar contra estos derechos
5191962 colocar a al sujeto en una situaci n de privaci n de algunos de los derechos vinculados con la dignidad humana
5191963 iran still has a long way to go as far as satellites are concerned and it deliberately exaggerates its air and space successes in order to dissuade israel or the united states from attacking its nuclear sites
5191964 it is clear that for years iran has had shihab 3 ballistic missiles which put israel within its reach but the threat posed by iran comes from its nuclear programme and not from its satellites or ballistic missiles
5191965 all i can say is welcome back to the major leagues
5191966 it was hard to control it was moving violently if i could have thrown it for strikes it would have been a real fun day
5191967 weve gotten ourselves in a hole and fought back out of it its small consolation
5191968 is maybe swinging the bat as good as anyone in the league weve just hit a spell where were giving up too many runs to sum it up if its not one thing its another
5191969 i feel balanced pretty good and im seeing the ball pretty well
5191970 and sometimes the ball does find holes im just trying to keep doing that the rest of the year
5191971 you never feel out of it and riggleman has a lot to do with it
5191972 when were down five or six hes in the dugout saying weve done it before dont give in
5191973 were going to get it together and get it turned around
5191974 hopefully well finish strong and leave the last taste of the season being a winning taste
5191975 when youre a finesse guy and youve got some nerves youre probably not going to locate as good as you would when youre more relaxed
5191976 he was on three days rest it was not his perfect routine to be pitching in well give him the benefit of the doubt there and run him out again on a little better routine
5191977 ive never pitched on three days rest so it could have played some scenario in how i did i felt good i felt normal i just got hit around
5191978 charlie hough told me this was the place former rangers catcher gino petralli had six or seven passed balls
5191979 it comes with the territory when you throw this pitch
5191980 it was moving a lot but thats not an excuse im supposed to catch those pitches
5191981 im all right with it but i dont know if my starting days are over this season and beyond
5191982 im hoping silvas situation is just a couple of weeks
5191983 he has at least another couple of starts down there
5191984 we hope to get at least two games in this week
5191985 our biggest concern is that guys can be with their families if something happens
5191986 theres not a malicious bone in this guys body hes a huge part of our potential weve got to eradicate that part of the way he plays
5191987 oh maria yang dikandung tanpa noda doakanlah kami orang yang berdosa ini
5191988 i felt a little more comfortable going from the stretch less moving parts its easier to get toward the target and that helped me out
5191989 those first two innings he was out of sync walking the leadoff hitter
5191990 but thats what you like about the kid he adjusted he did his job
5191991 der drastische nachfrageabschwung nach lcd panels ist nicht unn tigerweise eine schlechte sache f r die industrie da dies m glicherweise zu einer fr her als zu erwartenden knappheit am markt 2009 f hren k nnte

5191997 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5191998 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5191999 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5192000 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5192001 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5192002 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5192003 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5192004 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5192005 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5192006 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5192007 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5192008 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5192009 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5192010 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place

5192016 when the u s military death toll in iraq dropped to 13 last month it received wide attention but now midway through august the toll this month has already topped the july rate
5192017 a multi national division baghdad soldier and an iraqi interpreter were killed when the vehicle they were riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device in northwest baghdad at approximately 10 10 a m aug 13
5192018 6 die in bombing in iraq third in 3 days on shiites
5192019 people tried to salvage goods from a store that was destroyed saturday by a bombing in the shaab neighborhood of baghdad
5192020 on violence thats not covered elsewhere violence today unless the motor cyclist they describe is the bicyclist described by mcclatchy in which case the death count has risen from 6 to 15 with 29 more wounded
5192021 the numbers of houses rigged with explosives and roadside bombs have increased since the beginning of the iraqi offensive in diyala while other attack trends have been decreasing
5192022 it is an attempt to blow up the atmosphere of reconciliation between the people of balad and the other cities of salahuddin and to make another wave of sectarian anger
5192023 a s t poor job and acting like the iraq war ended
5192024 katrina vanden heuvel and all the beggars in indymedia and all the liars in corporate media are ensuring that a lot more people are going to die in that illegal war by their silences their lies and their refusal to make ending this illegal war their top agenda they have blood on their hands they need to be called out and confronted and the lies that barack is planning to end the war need to be called out every damn day
5192025 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5192026 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5192027 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5192028 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5192029 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5192030 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5192031 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5192032 just so you all know we did set a record
5192033 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5192034 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5192035 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5192036 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5192037 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5192038 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5192039 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5192040 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5192041 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5192042 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5192043 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
5192044 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
5192045 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5192046 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5192047 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5192048 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5192049 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5192050 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5192051 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5192052 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5192053 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5192054 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5192055 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5192056 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5192057 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5192058 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5192059 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5192060 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5192061 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5192062 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5192063 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5192064 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5192065 has the perrier gone straight to my head or is life sick and cruel instead
5192066 its time to take a look inside and find out the motivation for the behavior some shop just to fill themselves up and of course it doesnt last long
5192067 they certainly can take their own pulse when theyre thinking about shopping have a self dialogue
5192068 i have racked up a good amount of debt buying things i didnt need
5192069 when i wasnt happy i was disappearing a lot to the mall
5192070 its a diversion a distraction another way of not dealing with your problems
5192071 i thought of that in my bag and i felt happy
5192072 the nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from desert rock while less than emissions from san juan generating station and four corners power plant are still substantial and are being added to an airshed that is on the brink of not attaining the federal ozone standard

5192080 de laatste maanden zijn er echt wel erg veel diefstallen we vragen dan ook aan mensen die bij een werf wonen of er voorbij komen om verdachte dingen te vermelden

5192083 encourage modernist scholars to write textbooks and develop curricula publish introductory books at subsidized rates to make them as available as the tractates of fundamentalist authors
5192084 max orangnya aneh tapi sangat tulus setidaknya begitu yang aku yakini dia bilang kalau kita bisa benar benar mengerti betapa pentingnya naskah yang kau punya sekarang ini barulah ia mengirim sisanya
5192085 dia bilang semua ini tak berarti lagi baginya ia ingin menebus dosa
5192086 katanya mau kirim sesuatu via kurir tapi kok belum datang juga
5192087 jadi apa yang kita dapat dari naskah yunani kuno ini profesor
5192088 dongeng penyiksaan lagi ya martir yang menyiksa diri demi profit dan kesenangan pribadi
5192089 aku masih tak habis pikir setiap kali terbayang betapa banyak laporan dan catatan tertulis yang dipurukkan begitu saja oleh orang roma di ruang arsip mereka
5192090 bisa dibilang merekalah yang menemukan sistem birokrasi pelaporan dan catatan tertulis
5192091 kupikir semangat religius biasanya melulu berisi hiperbolisme padri padri gereja tanpa sentuhan realitas kau tahu bahan propaganda klasik buat kalangan beriman
5192092 satu hal yang pasti kalau dokumen ini benar benar autentik ia bisa jadi merupakan salah satu dari banyak sekali naskah karya eusebius yang hilang kau tahu dia adalah penulis biografi constantine
5192093 sembahlah tuhan kami yang sejati penuh cinta dan kasih atau kami cabik cabik bayi kalian
5192094 wah pasti sudah lebih dari cukup untuk membuatnya langsung dimartir
5192095 sepertinya aku sedang tidak mood meributkan hal itu lagi malam ini kalau boleh
5192096 seth mestinya kau tahu bahwa aku tidak bermaksud memojokkan setidaknya tidak secara langsung tapi kau pasti juga tahu bahwa tidak ada spiritualisme dalam agama terorganisir
5192097 agama lebih cenderung membunuh dan memecah belah orang sebuah agama terorganisir tak keberatan berbohong berbuat curang mencuri dan menghabiskan banyak waktu untuk menutupi kejahatannya sendiri lihat saja di mana mana orang yahudi dan arab para rabi ortodoks yang meninggikan diri sendiri sebagai ayatullah bangsa yahudi demi mengasingkan golongan yahudi lain muslim suni membunuhi muslim syiah katolik dan protestan saling cekik padahal masing masing dari mereka tak lebih rasis dan seksis dari kelompok yang mereka caci kalau tuhan sungguh ada dan wujudnya persis seperti kartun kartun karangan mereka maka percayalah masalah kita jauh lebih besar dari bayangan siapa pun
5192098 ia bangkit dan berjalan menuju bar mini dekat pintu tangannya sibuk membuka sumbat botol chateau la gaffeliere
5192099 dan terus terang aku benar benar suka dengan ayat mazmur yang berkoar tentang kisah saat berada di tepi sungai babilonia yang lantas digubah joni mitchell jadi lagu balada
5192100 cuma sayangnya tak ada yang ingat bahwa di akhir ayat mazmur itu ada tulisan yang berbunyi diberkatilah mereka yang membenturkan kepala anak anakmu ke batu ini kejam sekali bahkan tak ragu kusebut genocide pemusnahan bangsa jika aku percaya tuhan pastinya tak akan percaya pada tuhan yang menyuruhku membunuh bayi bayi
5192101 aku terbawa emosi headline koran akhir akhir ini sungguh mengesalkan sarat dengan manusia manusia angkuh dan sok paling benar sendiri
5192102 aku benar benar minta maaf tapi intermeso soal religi tadi membuatku kesal
5192103 ini kata yunani kuno untuk she atau kata ganti orang kedua bahasa inggris dalam bentuk feminin
5192104 kau ingat tadi aku bilang bahwa manuskrip ini baru konsep awal dan bukan merupakan karya utuh
5192105 nah aku bisa langsung mengenalinya karena pernah membaca kisah yang sama dari karya eusebius tapi karya itu aku baca versi finalnya malah bercerita tentang kemartiran narcissus jelas jelas ada kata
5192106 begitulah bisa ditebak berita kemukjizatan sophia segera tersebar luas eusebius yang saat itu menjabat sebagai uskup gereja kristen yang resmi dan diakui kaisar constantine datang mengunjungi dusun kecil tempat sophia tinggal jaraknya memang tidak terlalu jauh dari constantinople atau dari istana kekaisaran di nicomedia dugaanku peristiwa ini ternyata memberi dampak serius sampai memperoleh perhatian penuh dari kaisar sendiri
5192107 ia hadir menjadi penengah saat kekaisaran roma punya empat caesar yang saling cakar cakaran sebagian besar karirnya habis di medan perang dan kampanye menyatukan roma ini ia anggap vital demi mempertahankan diri dari serbuan suku suku barbar yang tak henti menggedor gerbang kota juga demi menyudahi perseteruan internal yang tak kunjung habis saat akhirnya meraih takhta sebagai kaisar tekadnya makin bulat untuk memerintah sebuah kekaisaran yang bersatu tak peduli apa atau siapa yang harus disingkirkan
5192108 memang tidak tapi kurasa dialah penguasa pertama yang mampu menyetir agama sedemikian rupa demi menyokong konsolidasi kekuatan pemerintahan ia mampu melihat bahwa agama baru ini tampaknya tidak akan lenyap begitu saja terlebih jika melihat bahwa selama tiga ratus tahun pertama pertumbuhannya agama kristen selalu menjadi pengaruh yang menggoyahkan kestabilan pemerintahan ia melihat ini sebagai sebuah kekuatan yang terus tumbuh jadi daripada dilawan lebih baik dipeluk dengan demikian ia mampu mengendalikan gereja untuk tujuan pribadi dan membentuk teologi demi kekuatan politik akibatnya sangat banyak hal hal yang diyakini orang orang zaman sekarang sebagai konstitusi keilahian sesungguhnya bersumber dari dekrit politik constantine yang dipaksakan di ujung pedang
5192109 bagaimana jika kucontohkan dengan satu hal yang paling mendasar dalam kepercayaan gereja kristen yaitu trinitas
5192110 kita tahu bahwa sama sekali tidak ada aturan pasti di gereja kristen perihal apakah yesus harus disembah setara dengan tuhan dan kau bisa menemukan banyak bukti nyata bahwa yesus sendiri sebenarnya
5192111 tapi di tahun 324 masehi isu ini diangkat ke permukaan oleh seorang uskup bernama arius seorang sesepuh gereja presbiter di alexandria
5192112 kerusuhan seperti ini tentu saja bukan pemandangan yang enak di mata kaisar inti permasalahannya pun membuat ia pusing dan sebal menurutnya masalah ini sangat sepele dan tak pantas diributkan jelas ia kaget saat perintahnya untuk menghentikan perseteruan tidak diindahkan segera ia menggelar konferensi nicean para ahli teologi gereja modern mewartakan dogma bahwa konferensi ini adalah pertemuan sekelompok orang orang suci atas wahyu tuhan dengan tuntunan ruh suci pada kenyataannya pertemuan di belakang gudang kayu itu adalah atas perintah constantine
5192113 sejauh ingatanku ini bukan pertama kalinya teologi ditulis di ujung todongan pedang
5192114 melihat para uskup lagi lagi berdebat di ruang konferensi constantine jadi habis kesabaran saat itu status religinya masih paganisme di mata gereja dan belum lagi dibaptis tapi ia lantang menengahi dan memutuskan bahwa yesus dan tuhan itu setara dalam esensi dan patut disembah secara seimbang di bawah ancaman pedang semua pihak di ruangan itu juga harus menanda tangani deklarasi kesaksian yang menyatakan bahwa putusan ini merupakan wahyu dan kehendak langsung dari tuhan dari sekian uskup dan petinggi gereja hanya dua orang yang menolak keduanya dikucilkan gereja dan semua tulisan mereka diperintahkan agar dibakar
5192115 jadi mirip kata pepatah ya tentang dua hal utama yang proses pembentukannya tak boleh diketahui publik yaitu sosis dan undang undang
5192116 aku jadi makin tak mengerti kenapa kau masih bersikeras untuk percaya padahal sudah tahu semua ini
5192117 kadang aku sendiri heran tapi aku terus berpikir bahwa di balik semua tipu daya teologi dan birokrasi gereja pasti ada setitik kebenaran yang bisa diimani
5192118 mungkin misteri itu memang harus ada karena kita berusaha menembus ketidakterbatasan dengan mata biologis yang begitu terbatas mungkin yang sesungguhnya diinginkan tuhan bukan penerimaan buta atas dogma tapi pencarian seumur hidup membuang apa yang jelas jelas palsu dan menguji sisanya itu sebabnya manuskrip pemberian max begitu penting manuskrip ini menunjukkan sekali lagi tentang bagaimana sebuah kebenaran disunting sedemikian rupa agar tampak seolah olah bernuansa ilahi demi kepentingan segelintir orang dalam hal ini mereka ingin menekan anggapan apa pun yang menyatakan bahwa wanita juga punya tempat dalam gereja jadilah mereka ubah gender sophia menjadi laki laki dalam versi manuskrip yang lebih dikenal luas
5192119 kalau terjemahan aslinya memang ada dan bukan sekedar ringkasan atau omong kosong lain yang disisipkan eusibius dalam manuskrip bukankah merupakan konfirmasi sekuler bahwa kisah sophia ini nyata bahwa ia mampu menghadirkan mukjizat
5192120 kekuatan untuk menyembuhkan benar benar nyata dan hadir di pikiran semua orang
5192121 tapi apakah transkripsinya sendiri turut menghadirkan pembuktian toh kita tahu bahwa pihak penguasa jelas jelas menentangnya jika mereka mengonfirmasi peristiwa kemukjizatan dan penyembuhan itu bukannya malah menurunkan kredibilitas kesaksian kalangan yang meyakini sophia
5192122 bisa jadi atau bisa juga ada segelintir kaum revisionis kristen cerdas yang membuat transkripsi tersebut lalu mengatributkannya ke peradilan dari pihak penguasa agar tampak seolah olah demikian bagaimanapun manuskrip ini tetap menjadi hal terpenting sepanjang karierku
5192123 rasanya seolah semua yang pernah kulakukan semua yang telah aku pelajari sampai sekarang hanya merupakan latihan untuk sampai ke momen ini
5192124 kurasa kadang kadang tuhan mengulurkan tangan dan mendorong kita sampai ke tepian pencarian
5192125 kita cuma harus sedikit putar otak untuk bisa mengenali dorongan tersebut seumur hidup aku berdoa menginginkan hal seperti ini
5192126 aku juga takjub dengan semua ini sama sepertimu ini juga peristiwa sekali seumur hidup buatku tapi tak harus dikaitkan dengan intervensi ilahiah kan yang jelas kau memang
5192127 aduh sayang mungkin sebaiknya kau mandi dulu kalau mau aku lengket padamu
5192128 aku mau taruh ini dulu di kotak deposit hotel sekalian memastikan apakah kiriman max sudah sampai atau belum
5192129 when youre the first and only in anything you stand with a target on your back
5192130 you ask yourself if i wear my hijab can i get a job
5192131 its part of our responsibility as muslims to denounce misconceptions
5192132 practicing in isolation is just as dangerous as extremism if you function in isolation you allow a void to exist and allow certain extreme tendencies to define who you are
5192133 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5192134 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5192135 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5192136 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5192137 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5192138 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

5192147 la soluci n a este grave impacto ambiental es impedir que los fertilizantes y residuos lleguen al mar lo que es bastante complicado por ejemplo en el mar negro se redujo en la d cada de 1990 el vertido de sustancias qu micas empleadas en la agricultura y la anoxia desapareci aunque con una nueva expansi n de la agricultura ha resurgido
5192148 when i hear obama i think yeah mccain comes across as a grouchy old man but the contrast on the issues eventually becomes clear
5192149 but mccain was clear on issues like life he said life begins at conception thats my position he believes what i believe i like obama but ill be voting for mccain
5192150 weve had a republican and i have moments when i approve and moments when i dont approve
5192151 the more conservative element of the christian population is slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like

5192207 the president is determined to defend himself he will fight on he has given no indication that he will accept the charges against him
5192208 there is a strong possibility that he might announce his resignation but there is equally a chance that he might commit a blunder
5192209 our stance is still the same that those who violated the constitution should not be given safe passage or indemnity of his actions
5192210 he is a wise man he is a very experienced
5192211 his political fate has been sealed whatever he says doesnt matter
5192212 thats not an issue on the table and i just want to keep our focus on what we must do with the democratic government of pakistan
5192213 the iphones roll out in the philippine market came at a very bad time
5192214 despite of the price cuts made by globe technology consumers are now very cautious on spending for high end luxury items due to spiraling food and transportation costs

5192251 yeah a walk off home run in game six ended it toronto won

5192268 the amount being paid to the industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control is far too small
5192269 if that does not become the case as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
5192270 ecosystems from which people other than the recording industry have derived the majority of value created
5192271 music publishers see music based games as a growth opportunity in an otherwise struggling music business and theyre trying to grab as much of that growth as they can
5192272 we get the content and they get a financial royalty and the promotion and exposure for their bands
5192273 we hope that our partners in the gaming space appreciate not only the value of their own contributions but also those of the recording artists songwriters record labels and music publishers on which their games are significantly based
5192274 major music labels need to reposition themselves as proactive players in developing digital music businesses rather than victims they have a lot of power

5192292 overall manufacturing employment declined by 32 000 in july as the number of factory workers dropped by 41 000 in ontario and increased by 7 000 in alberta
5192293 over the past 12 months manufacturing employment across canada was down 88 000 with nearly all the losses in ontario
5192294 while the 32 300 decline in manufacturing jobs came as no surprise we were slightly puzzled by the continued strength in the construction sector which posted an additional 10 300 jobs
5192295 with all signs pointing to a significant slowdown in the canadian housing market it is only a matter of time before construction hiring follows suit
5192296 these numbers are truly shocking canadians havent experienced job losses like this since 17 years ago when the country was in full recession
5192297 since this time last year weve lost another 88 000 manufacturing jobs now in the middle of the summer were seeing people give up on the job market altogether this is a catastrophe for working families
5192298 at that time we could only express disbelief at this tremendous pace of job growth amidst obvious signs of a weakening economy this was simply an unsustainable pace of job creation and it is not surprising to see some payback
5192299 theyre so good i would love to be able to play on that team in the spring well see
5192300 sometimes when you mix and match personnel things like that happen
5192301 we have a lot of work to do on offense the next two weeks a lot of work
5192302 the last touchdown was a check at the line it gave him the leverage we needed and he attacked it it is something he certainly wouldnt have been able to do last year
5192303 it is something that comes along with the offense once you learn this offense more and understand what is happening it is going to be a whole lot easier
5192304 i know what is going on and what to look for and what is expected of me
5192305 i know the guys around me and they know exactly what i want and exactly what i need
5192306 once you learn this offense more and understand what is happening it is going to be a whole lot easier
5192307 we are playing a lot of different players right now
5192308 when you dont play on edge on defense like we have been playing in camp you arent going to be as successful
5192309 our defense didnt come with the enthusiasm and excitement that we had
5192310 im really glad to see what we did because the defense has been getting the best of us and kicking our tails so far
5192311 i like the way we responded but we still have a lot of practices to go before we catch up to those guys
5192312 robby showed what kind of a weapon he can be
5192313 he is a dangerous man in a lot of different situations we have to continue to get him the ball
5192314 he is a fun guy to have on your team
5192315 i think its going to encourage faster play and i think thats good for us we want to play at a faster tempo
5192316 a lot of times with us the umpire would be standing over the ball letting the defense make substitutions and all that and now i dont think that is going to be the case
5192317 people are going to look at his size and think he is not going to fit the bill but hell fill those shoes really well he is going to be everywhere across the field everywhere youll see him on every play
5192318 dont tell coach but we shouldnt have even practiced that day we should have been there all day it was a lot of fun a lot of team bonding offense and defense working together
5192319 that was real fun we were competing as usual offense and defense i think i had more kills than receivers terrell turner and mike thomas combined but its their fault i was trained when i was like 6 i was on the swat team but i decided to just play football

5192334 they ministry of transportation need to do a modern reassessment of the whole of porteau bluff using current design standards for dealing with an unstable rock formation which includes taking earthquake loading into account
5192335 this has been talked about for years it is sad that we have to wait for something to happen before the discussion starts
5192336 the immediate work that needed to be done was completed
5192337 future inspection will determine if bolting and meshing will be necessary in the longer term
5192338 the bluff wasnt part of the upgrade because the ministry felt there was enough room to add a third lane by paving the railway line
5192339 to do any more work beyond the extra lane could be extremely expensive that is why this location wasnt chosen for work in the 600 million sea to sky highway improvement project
5192340 there are a bunch of big tilted slabs of rock hanging above the highway
5192341 these joints dip like a stack of books one on top of the other tilted toward the highway
5192342 i have led many field trips with engineers through there
5192343 this is a must stop for a geohazard field trip it goes back to 1955 when great pacific eastern railway went through they were the first to expose the slope or undermine those big slabs
5192344 it is now known that a magnitude 9 earthquake could happen here but at the time it was believed to be 7
5192345 there is a much greater hazard from earthquakes and bolting does not take earthquake loading into account if this portion of road shakes a big slab could come down
5192346 nothing happened until a private helijet and water taxis got transportation going
5192347 the government built an emergency ferry terminal in porteau cove but it should have been placed further north they took a chance putting it on the wrong side of one of the most unstable areas in howe sound

5192595 and so her editor called her at 3 a m and said you know we just got this news that carolines hamster died and she said you have to call white house press secretary pierre salinger right now and find out if this is true and so thomas didnt even think about it
5192596 she picked up the phone and she called pierre salinger and she said is it true is it true caroline kennedys hamster died and pierre salinger was like helen its 3 oclock in the morning are you insane youre calling me about this stupid hamster and you know she heard about that for a good long time

5192831 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
5192832 we have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and rails
5192833 if someone had made those doubts clear to me i would not have permitted the reporting to be used in secretary powells speech
5192834 was not just wrong they lied they should have been shot
5192835 the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire bush administration
5192836 were starting our work and im calling everyone back weve got a huge amount of work to engage in
5192837 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary
5192838 youll receive only the most election crucial information by keeping yourself and your friends informed well win this election by margins so great the gop will be forced to stop fielding candidates who would deny us education health care and a decent environment
5192839 we had made a decision how we were going to start the first two games and thats about as far as weve gone
5192840 lets try slow medicine an interview with dennis mccullough m d
5192841 id have to say that monckton won the debate he came across as more prepared and had answers at his fingertips whereas richard appeared to verbally stumble on occasion
5192842 i got the impression that littlemore was engaging in the debate totally unprepared
5192843 oh my this is very confusing no wonder the government says its too early to take action
5192844 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5192845 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5192846 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5192847 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5192848 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5192849 you people have brought so much advancement to the country sir today everything is getting computerized
5192850 you sit in an office and write something on a computer and it does so many big things outside
5192851 it is not as simple as that my friend it is not just a question of writing a few lines there is a lot of process that goes behind it
5192852 it has to be no wonder you people are so highly paid
5192853 everyone just sees the money no one sees the amount of hard work we have to put in indians have such a narrow concept of hard work just because we sit in an air conditioned office does not mean our brows do not sweat you exercise the muscle we exercise the mind and believe me that is no less taxing
5192854 let me give you an example take this train the entire railway reservation system is computerized you can book a train ticket between any two stations from any of the hundreds of computerized booking centres across the country thousands of transactions accessing a single database at a time concurrently data integrity locking data security do you understand the complexity in designing and coding such a system
5192855 oh come on does life ever get easy as you go up the ladder responsibility only brings more work design and coding that is the easier part now i do not do it but i am responsible for it and believe me that is far more stressful my job is to get the work done in time and with the highest quality to tell you about the pressures there is the customer at one end always changing his requirements the user at the other wanting something else and your boss always expecting you to have finished it yesterday
5192856 you dont know what it is to be in the line of fire
5192857 i know sir i know what it is to be in the line of fire
5192858 there were 30 of us when we were ordered to capture point 4875 in the cover of the night the enemy was firing from the top there was no knowing where the next bullet was going to come from and for whom in the morning when we finally hoisted the tricolour at the top only 4 of us were alive
5192859 i am subedar sushant from the 13 j amp k rifles on duty at peak 4875 in kargil they tell me i have completed my term and can opt for a soft assignment but tell me sir can one give up duty just because it makes life easier on the dawn of that capture one of my colleagues lay injured in the snow open to enemy fire while we were hiding behind a bunker it was my job to go and fetch that soldier to safety but my captain sahib refused me permission and went ahead himself he said that the first pledge he had taken as a gentleman cadet was to put the safety and welfare of the nation foremost followed by the safety and welfare of the men he commanded his own personal safety came last always and every time
5192860 he was killed as he shielded and brought that injured soldier into the bunker every morning thereafter as we stood guard i could see him taking all those bullets which were actually meant for me i know sir i know what it is to be in the line of fire
5192861 our results suggest that interventions may have a real opportunity to influence at least a quarter of the
5192862 stands back from rushed in hospital interventions and slows down to balance thoughtfully the separate multiple and complex issues of late life
5192863 embraces the unsung work of daily attention that is the greatest need and firmest foundation for longevity and quality of life at the farthest reach of age
5192864 if you can remove one of those three the crime wont take place
5192865 when we all take roles seriously and accept the responsibility you see the calls for service on those properties go down
5192866 it starts to build relationships and we start to earn the trust of one another its a win win win all the way around
5192867 if everyone does their part they will see a more stable resident base fewer people wanting to leave and causing problems to be evicted
5192868 they gave us things that made you go aha things you normally wouldnt think of to prevent crime
5192869 el trabajo productivo en el cual los derechos son respetados con seguridad y protecci n y con la posibilidad de participaci n en las decisiones que afectan a los trabajadores
5192870 pacto de mediano plazo por la inversi n y el empleo digno
5192871 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush
5192872 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
5192873 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time
5192874 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
5192875 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5192876 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5192877 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5192878 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
5192879 10 6 gw the generation capacity of the six plants x 7884 hours of generation per year assuming 90 operational 83 57 twh y 83 57 twh y x 0 65 54 mt co2 y
5192880 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5192881 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5192882 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5192883 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5192884 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5192885 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5192886 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5192887 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5192888 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5192889 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5192890 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5192891 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5192892 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault
5192893 any time something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up
5192894 everything there is to know about me has been in the media ad nauseam
5192895 there are probably things out there about me that even i dont know
5192896 i lost the election in 2004 thanks to a certain group of people in the south end of the county
5192897 i think it was something that was planned ahead of time
5192898 things went from bad to worse to much worse it began my hell to be honest with you
5192899 i chose the touch screen voting machines they were the only equipment that every voter regardless of disability could use
5192900 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5192901 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5192902 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5192903 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5192904 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
5192905 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
5192906 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
5192907 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
5192908 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
5192909 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
5192910 scott you being unaware lord christopher monckton of brenchleys paper posted by roy august 16 2008 10 55 pm
5192911 expert scientists disagreed on the key contributor to global warming at a senate environment and public works committee hearing roy w spencer former nasa scientist during the clinton administration attributes the majority of global warming contributions to errors in measurement spencer claimed that the clinton administration told him what he could and could not say to congress about global warming and greenhouse emissions chairwoman barbara boxer d calif cited spencers blog where he admits that the clinton administration never told him what was and was not permissible to say to congress
5192912 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5192913 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
5192914 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
5192915 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
5192916 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5192917 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5192918 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5192919 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5192920 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5192921 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5192922 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5192923 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5192924 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5192925 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5192926 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5192927 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5192928 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5192929 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5192930 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5192931 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5192932 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something

5192937 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5192938 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5192939 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5192940 i am married to the next president of the united states
5192941 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5192942 we remain bitterly disappointed at the manner in which sonny bill deserted his teammates and his supporters
5192943 we have however reached the point where we need to get on with business and we have withdrawn the injunction against him playing for any other club
5192944 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
5192945 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
5192946 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
5192947 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
5192948 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt
5192949 pete your just a denier the register didnt just make numbers up out of thin air they based on research from people who you know actually study the climate once again this doesnt fit your meme and mindset im hear to free ideologs like you and brian from your mind set
5192950 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5192951 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5192952 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5192953 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5192954 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5192955 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5192956 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5192957 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5192958 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5192959 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5192960 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5192961 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5192962 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5192963 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5192964 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5192965 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5192966 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5192967 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5192968 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5192969 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5192970 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5192971 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5192972 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5192973 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5192974 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5192975 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5192976 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5192977 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5192978 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5192979 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5192980 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5192981 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5192982 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5192983 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5192984 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5192985 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5192986 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5192987 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5192988 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5192989 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5192990 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5192991 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5192992 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5192993 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5192994 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5192995 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5192996 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5192997 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5192998 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5192999 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5193000 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5193001 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
5193002 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5193003 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5193004 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5193005 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5193006 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5193007 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5193008 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5193009 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5193010 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5193011 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5193012 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5193013 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5193014 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5193015 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5193016 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5193017 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5193018 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5193019 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5193020 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5193021 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5193022 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5193023 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5193024 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5193025 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5193026 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5193027 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5193028 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5193029 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5193030 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5193031 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5193032 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5193033 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5193034 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5193035 recycling is recycling glass should be included its not about making money its about making difference
5193036 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5193037 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5193038 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5193039 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
5193040 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
5193041 the reason we are able to do the things we do so well is his ability to disguise and be athletic enough to get where he has to be
5193042 i think also from a psyche standpoint and preparation standpoint for offenses hes a guy you have to prepare for there are probably only a few guys in the league on defense you have to scheme for and i think troys one of those guys and that helps us out a lot
5193043 thank you so much for contributing to my air conditioning and i wish that maintenance will follow so that we will have air con throughout the whole year
5193044 for my past four years since attending since freshman year my experience at southern high has been very terrible
5193045 thank you so much for contributing to my air conditioning and i wish that maintenance will follow so that we will have air con throughout the whole year
5193046 lancet has since disowned the paper but not before fears of the mmr vaccine became widespread and led to many parents choosing not to vaccinate their children and a serious increase in measles in the uk
5193047 i think thats true if we had not had any urgency to get on with it we would not be in the muddle we are in now because we would have done it in the usual way by getting a referral dr wakefield was a man in a hurry and in full time research

5193075 ive made all the beds and washed the dishes and did the laundry and swept the floors ive done all the things you dont like to do im hard working and honest except for when i broke into your house
5193076 the whole idea of announcing the project long before things had even begun to fall in place was to cash in on kishoredas 79th birthday aug 4 the fact is nothing is ready yet it would take at least a year if not more for this ambitious project to concretise
5193077 it is a daunting task to put together a biopic on a man as colourful versatile adventurous and unpredictable as kishore kumar
5193078 im currently in new york finalising locations for the film that im going to direct for karan johar so i really dont know whats going on back home
5193079 they mustve their reason for announcing the project when they did i havent started any work on it ive just heard that im doing it
5193080 the films director shoojit sircar and i have known each other for years when i was told he was helming the project i didnt hesitate
5193081 how do i telescope a life so flush with genius do i go back and forth in time a linear narrative seems impossible but one thing i wont do is official research
5193082 i dont want to harp on well known myths about kishore kumar like his eccentricity etc id rather dwell on unknown facets of the man for this id have to meet the people who knew kishore kumar intimately
5193083 i guess id first have to know the people who knew kishore kumar before i can find out about him so yes this project will take a great amount of time and i wont be rushed
5193084 well most people who saw rang de basanti felt connecting bhagat singh to a contemporary context was something theyd have never imagined i know chronicling kishore kumars life wont be easy but who said i want to take the easy way out
5193085 ha thats a tough one we need someone who can dance sing act and look like the great man but our industry is full of surprises
5193086 please dont forget when robert downey jr was selected to play charlie chaplin in the richard attenborough biopic people thought it was the worst injustice to be done to the comic genius kishoreda is our comic genius and there must be someone equal to the task of portraying a man so versatile

5193088 neena and i have been very close friends for decades the mehndi i applied at her wedding festivities is still bright red and wet on my palms shes courageous to have grabbed the chance to find domestic bliss at this age that evening we all celebrated the vibrancy of love and marriage in our middle age but then shared joy like this cuts across all barriers
5193089 i was part of the brides side soni neena ila and i have bonded since 1982 when we worked together in shyam benegals mandi soni is married and now neena
5193090 it was a memorable wedding after the impromptu wedding in the us i told kalpana she shouldve brought along the man she loves and undergone a wedding ceremony
5193091 i know the mehndi and sangeet ceremonies happen before the wedding i also know im past the age of such frolic and fun but what to do all my friends are young at heart and so am i they all wanted to be part of my marriage even if it was belatedly
5193092 my friends felt so left out i feel bad about that thats why im happy i went through the sangeet and mehndi ceremonies like in a proper wedding never mind if it happened in the reverse order the important thing is to enjoy what you do in life and my friends had a ball on saturday

5193118 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

5193234 hoy estaba muy concentrado para hacer una buen salida pero me ha salido todo lo contrario ha sido una carrera muy complicada porque he ido escalando posiciones poco a poco y cuando he llegado con los de delante bradl ya se hab a escapado as que las opciones de victoria eran m nimas la prueba ha sido muy divertido porque entonces me he jugado el podio con talmacsi terol y di meglio yo sab a que ten a un buen ritmo para mantenerme arriba pero desconoc a el del resto los entrenamientos con agua de por medio han sido muy extra os y se me complic la puesta a punto desde el primer momento pero ahora me siento muy feliz muy contento por el cuarto podio de la temporada el primer tercer puesto de este a o el equipo ha hecho un gran trabajo as que tambi n estoy muy feliz por ellos ahora esperamos repetir en san marino y si se puede mejorar es la forma de seguir acerc ndonos a los de delante
5193235 he realizado una buena salida pero luego me he dado cuenta de que no pod a aguantar el ritmo del mis rivales me he ido retrasando me he sentido impotente porque creo que ha sido por culpa del neum tico trasero que debe haber salido defectuoso en el tramo final iba und cimo pero dentro de un grupo junto a iannone corsi y redding al final he sido octavo he vuelto a puntuar despu s de la lesi n y ahora s lo espero llegar a san marino y mejorar este resultado
5193236 gracias a aprilia y a dani amatriain los cilindros el material nuevo que hemos recibido este fin de semana han hecho que seamos competitivos hemos vuelto a demostrar que podemos estar en la lucha por el titulo esta victoria la segunda de la temporada nos ha de dar confianza para lo que viene ahora que ser n seis carreras muy duras en las que hemos de seguir recuper ndole terreno a los dos primeros la prueba de hoy ha sido muy divertida desde el principio hemos estado muy juntos y la verdad es que sab a donde pod a superar a mis rivales esta vez ha salido todo bien y ahora nos vamos con muchas ganas a san marino
5193237 estoy muy contento porque era dif cil conseguir este resultado los entrenamientos no ha sido nada buenos todo un desastre pero hoy lo hemos solventado y hemos podido sumar puntos y estar en el top 10 la l stima ha sido que podr a haber mejorado alguna posici n m s si no llego a tener un toque con roberto locatelli que me ha hecho salirme creo que hubiese podido estar cerca de h ctor faubel

5193260 if hes phil maestri very specific well take the appropriate actions to get things corrected and not play this hide and seek game but that seems to be the problem if they think were meddling in management well he needs to look in the mirror to see whos in charge of him it all starts from the top
5193261 weve got some assurances that we asked for weve got some official information on progress what were doing this week is gathering additional information that validates it
5193262 thats part of what were looking at i cant answer that until the end of the week
5193263 you dont play the games on paper you play them on the field
5193264 we cant pay attention to the other teams we just have to concentrate on winning our games
5193265 one of the benefits is that we like to support the local farms we like to give the money back to our local people we also depend on not having as much pesticides in our produce as possible
5193266 we try our best not to give out to go menus we offer everyone to leave their email address or a contact number and we can fax or email our menus we try to save on paper as much as possible
5193267 everybody has to be on the same level if you can convince them to see the important things in life and not just money then its a chain reaction
5193268 unfortunately i think were on our way to being there
5193269 were fooling ourselves if we say things arent going to change
5193270 but if we do it right we can preserve the important elements of this area for future generations
5193271 but were conscious of the tax burden it creates especially for families on fixed incomes
5193272 for someone as religious as she was there is an eerie sense of comfort in that
5193273 there is comfort in knowing she died on the assumption and she died peacefully
5193274 our determination to fight for what we believe in comes from her
5193275 dad was kind of a laid back guy but mom didnt hesitate to pick up the phone and give us her opinion about our lives and careers
5193276 it was mom she wanted to know what i was doing i didnt even know she had the number of my car phone she said you cant disagree with the archdiocese
5193277 i hope weve accomplished a lot of what she expected of us
5193278 and we will continue to do what she expected she used to say youre only as good as what you leave behind
5193279 whatever we had oatmeal cold cereal eggs there were always those powdered rolls from the bakery
5193280 that was one of the defining moments of my life that they shared that special moment with me
5193281 she wanted to make sure people were fed and clothed
5193282 she also provided food for elderly people living in the neighborhood when she was living at the shore she would take platters of food to a neighbor
5193283 she instilled in us the desire to fight for the underdog she believed that all people are equal and should be treated with respect and dignity
5193284 she was the epitome of what a mother is supposed to be
5193285 we used to say she brought more gifts than santa claus
5193286 my friends said every time they saw her she was fashionably appropriate for her age you would never catch her in sneakers and a sweatshirt
5193287 she started her family life with her husband and he was with her when she died
5193288 its a large task but this group can do that
5193289 next couple of days heads down butts up and lets put this thing to bed agreed
5193290 the issue is how do we do it how do you put the fire back in were still struggling with that
5193291 we would wake up every day and get a different assignment there was never really consistent firefighting
5193292 like i told someone a while ago fighting fire is the easy part
5193293 fire was fine to burn across the park naturally and do the things mother nature meant to do until we had full suppression at old faithful
5193294 and then we do full suppression here and there and then were doing full suppression all over
5193295 the safety of the public and the employees is paramount
5193296 this is a fire were managing to minimize the risk to the firefighters
5193297 there may be a secondary benefit to the forest but its certainly not an objective
5193298 were not going over that in fact thats coming down over the next few days
5193299 believe it or not they know what you are doing and they like what you are doing
5193300 i have a lot more self worth than i had before
5193301 my kids friends mom are proud of me and they look at me different
5193302 its a beautiful thing that they do this for us and our families
5193303 it shows that there are people who care about us
5193304 these are people who make it possible for us to eat every day
5193305 we have hundreds and hundreds of individual small contributors we just may not hit them up every cycle
5193306 most incumbents dont face serious challengers therefore there is simply no incentive to do it
5193307 they are fully capable of raising 1 million or more through washington fundraising events
5193308 i wasnt going to self fund i refused to go into debt i wasnt going to get the big dollars that an incumbent can get
5193309 he is the first political candidate who has grabbed my attention and made me want to donate
5193310 we were trying to engage people who had previously been shunned by the establishment
5193311 there is a psychological element to the commitment of giving money
5193312 this will be a life changing experience for the students from china
5193313 imagine yourself trying to learn a foreign countrys political system at the height of its election cycle
5193314 i think it will be incredible to follow the campaigns firsthand
5193315 im excited to offer my opinion and tell people what i see out there
5193316 the employer has been put on notice step out of line again and litigation is very much on the table he said
5193317 ignorance will not be an acceptable excuse second time around
5193318 the big miners were playing catch up from lower commodity prices over the weekend but weve seen oil tick up on a weakening us dollar and theres a potential storm brewing over the gulf of mexico
5193319 golds recovered to back over us800 00 an ounce and people are jockeying for position along with the bhp result which is coming out as we speak
5193320 we are considering this very closely and i expect to work with mr snowden on this issue he managed the whole question about hmas sydney very well
5193321 its premature to be talking about funding at this point but what i can say is that well examine all issues around the centaur very closely and the relevant minister in this case mr snowden will be actively involved with that
5193322 some unexpected process is vigorously heating the interior of enceladus especially the south polar region and causing the ejection of the plumes of ice particles
5193323 its a very serious issue for households its a very serious issue for business and its a very serious issue for our national economy
5193324 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5193325 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5193326 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks
5193327 what ive said is that we are always looking at the extent of competition within the mortgage market and if the banks dont move ive said the treasury are examining a range of options and all options are on the table
5193328 there is no way in the world we can return to a situation where the federal government regulates interest rates

5193338 a valuable and sustainable transport link between the two communities
5193339 the review of the service that operated over last winter and the number of passengers who used the service clearly demonstrates that this is a valuable and well used service
5193340 failure to continue with an all year round service would in my opinion now be a retrograde step
5193341 report of the special commission on the episcopal church and the anglican communion
5193342 first i want to thank the special commission and committee for this thoughtful and honest work that is before us in these resolutions at the very heart of all of these resolutions i have experienced the commitment of our church to seek to keep all at the one table i believe these resolutions capture the essence of what it means to live in the tension of anglicanism a theology that believes god lives in that place the edge if you will that god lives in that tension and that being said perhaps above all else as episcopalians we do not live in that place alone for we are anglicans as well three years ago i believe our church acted and voted in ways that were unilateral ignoring the reality of our interdependent relationship with the worldwide anglican communion not dependent not independent but rather interdependent we had not done the hard theological work that needed to be done and many of our priests people and parishes were unprepared for the ramifications these have been very hard times for those of us who truly want all at the one table and want the episcopal church to remain in the anglican communion i live for the day that such a ballroom would be filled at general convention to debate issues of poverty and not human sexuality and i pray that both houses will support the essence of these resolutions as a significant and holy way forward thank you

5193346 i dont mind competition from private domestic players but i feel bad if the order is won by any chinese company
5193347 we have expertise for supplying equipments for 250 and 500 mw but in between suddenly the norms were changed to 300 and 600 mw only to accomodate chinese firms but this norm has now been removed
5193348 all political parties all right thinking people must work together to bring the situation under control
5193349 everybody has an obligation to contribute all political parties as i said from the ramparts of the red fort this is not a partisan issue
5193350 eighty five percent of the units already have been sold at lakeside lofts but we still have a nice selection of premium residences
5193351 our current prices on each remaining residence not only offer free parking but also include 10 000 worth of designer upgrades
5193352 when we designed lakeside lofts we decided that we wanted to build an architecturally interesting project that would be good for the environment and also a nice place to live
5193353 inside each loft unit has been designed with the goal of creating interesting spaces
5193354 most high rise buildings have moved to engineered flooring that typically has a thin hardwood veneer on top of the particle board
5193355 we use solid oak hardwood flooring in living room dining room and kitchen
5193356 our insulation far exceeds that required by the city of chicago energy code and that of many other condo buildings in the city

5193363 its nice to get a warm welcome when you come home
5193364 tampa bay was obviously a huge part of my career
5193365 i grew up here as a football player i won a super bowl were real proud what we did for this organization
5193366 i was trying to squeeze it in there but next time that ball has to go 5 yards into the stands
5193367 im not sure exactly what the situation is but hopefully thats not a problem
5193368 there were a lot of players who didnt make the trip the guys who were here played the ones who didnt obviously didnt if they didnt make the trip they didnt play if they didnt make the trip they werent going to play
5193369 i didnt try anything that long last year we didnt have to its just that plain and simple
5193370 if i get a shot i get a shot it doesnt count for more as long as i make the ones i get the opportunity to kick im happy its not a who can kick it the farthest contest
5193371 i think its like anybody that gets their first reps you kind of have to get into a groove where the game is moving fast again
5193372 it was good to be back they didnt have to carry me off on a cart or anything
5193373 i have a great black and white photo of the two of us sitting at a table that day with my entire family standing behind us
5193374 it is a day i will never forget and a memory i will always cherish
5193375 well i think its pretty obvious that weve got a lot of work to do based on all three phases of the game
5193376 i didnt think we played as well or as competitively as were capable of playing certainly
5193377 so weve just got to work on the little things but those little things add up to big things
5193378 you can put that in the globe and print it
5193379 more and more open source projects are either integrating with the web or are developed entirely for on demand use

5193382 he had a bad last season at marseille because he had meningitis and spent two weeks in hospital
5193383 the year before everyone wanted him but sometimes you have to be brave enough when everyone else says he is not good
5193384 he had made an impression that i kept with me i had seen things in him and i had to go with my beliefs
5193385 marc overmars was in a similar situation before he came to arsenal and hopefully nasri can have the same impact here
5193386 there is a bit of robert pires in him as he is able to change direction very easily

5193389 my doubles partner caye inglis from lynden and i will be playing in the huntsman senior games in st george utah
5193390 ill soon be starting critiqued tennis lessons in singles too
5193391 despite the heat i didnt hear one complaint from joyce
5193392 im 52 and im tired from playing two matches yesterday and shes not tired at all
5193393 not overdoing it thinking and feeling positive and trying not to complain
5193394 i realized how much i missed it playing anderson was completely different from anything in high school but i was happy with my game she just hits so hard
5193395 basically i just want to come in and help the offensive line any way i can
5193396 i want to be the guy we can depend on and just continue to work hard and practice hard
5193397 he seemed very upbeat about the situation you never want to see somebody get hurt but he said he was just going to take a little time off
5193398 right now they have me working at right tackle primarily and i feel comfortable there but whatever the team needs me to do i can do
5193399 being on that side is different and it has my balance off a little bit but it is much easier when you have a good player playing next to you somebody to lean on
5193400 there is some less experience with ray but ray is physical and he is very good at his technique he wont miss a beat
5193401 i dont know how many players already on the 40 man roster will be brought up
5193402 some players can help us and some deserve to be rewarded for their seasons but face it most of the kids are already here
5193403 the way were swinging the bats you never feel out of the game no matter what the score
5193404 when we got ichiro up there in the ninth inning in that situation i thought you know we might pull this out
5193405 i dont throw 95 mph so i cant blow it by guys
5193406 in and out i was putting the ball where i wanted but up and down i was leaving pitches up and they hit them
5193407 hes a finesse pitcher and hed never pitched on three days rest
5193408 well give him his regular routine and run him back out there in five days
5193409 when you have a good knuckleball its tough to catch
5193410 its tough to catch in the bullpen tough to catch in between innings and tough to catch when the umpire says play ball
5193411 im feeling balanced at the plate seeing the ball real well
5193412 id like to keep this going the rest of the season
5193413 the reason we think we can come back a lot of it is riggleman
5193414 hes on top of everything he stays on us and gives you no choice but to battle and keep battling

5193421 there are 43 indictees out of 45 that are already sent to the hague
5193422 make sure that gen mladic and hadzic are found and given a chance to defend themselves
5193423 i hope and i will suggest that sooner rather than later we are going to be able to announce that this chapter is closed and that there are no more indictees
5193424 we have tried that in the 1990s we dont want to go down that path again
5193425 we put tremendous effort and thought into being top performers in this area its gratifying to have the results validated by an independent third party
5193426 both programs effectively and efficiently collect debt and have excellent performance measures in place to gauge the effectiveness of their collection efforts
5193427 theres only so much you can do if all your debt is tied up in one company thats bankrupt and subject to massive litigation
5193428 its a very tight plan to get there with benefits by 2009 theres not a lot of wiggle room
5193429 we were in ramp up phase we had staff in place and needed to bring more staff on board weve got a very carefully designed work plan and its one of those conversations well be having
5193430 you dont want to waste money on delay you have to be mindful of that and mindful of legislative directions and timelines
5193431 those are the kinds of things that go into considering whether something that is exempt from the freeze or not
5193432 it belongs to the men and women of wsp who are committed to reducing deaths and injuries on washington highways
5193433 its about knowing the other its giving an opportunity to each side to tell their stories
5193434 and its about americans seeing it up close and personal
5193435 as an american im right in the middle i feel like it gives me the potential to help
5193436 we want the others to look at us and make them feel some of our pain and to teach them things they dont know about
5193437 they dont know some of the horrible things happening to us im feeling proud to be a girl who tried to make my enemy change their ideas about us
5193438 id never been told about the situation of the palestinians
5193439 almost everyone said the program changed their lives for the better changed what they planned to study what they would do as work it made some israelis question military service
5193440 because they returned as changed people to communities that sometimes didnt welcome those changes
5193441 i can only change myself and then maybe some people close to me
5193442 and so that insult that began all those years ago just becomes greater and greater
5193443 what we try to operate here is a no nuisance facility
5193444 landfills in reality are complex environmental systems that need to be managed as ongoing construction projects
5193445 fact of the matter is weve been living high on trash for a long time
5193446 during those 10 seconds your brain is actually doing something amazing
5193447 how could one rock make you feel like that it was a total body effect
5193448 it is time to move heparin off the farm and into the factory where it will be safer to make and more regulated
5193449 the crisis was motivation to pull this kind of technical gee whiz process we used in our laboratories and think about how to scale it up to producing heparin by the metric ton
5193450 we use approximately three trillion units of heparin a year in the u s
5193451 its truly immense at jefferson we were using 1 000 multidose vials a week
5193452 the way that he has outlined this i think it is very feasible
5193453 after parking oh about 2 miles from where we were meeting people which made for a sweaty walk across the park i was reminded again of how expansive
5193454 i love this trail im originally from peachtree city ga the home of backwoods trails it has over 80 miles of golf cart paths winding through the
5193455 never thought i would be reviewing about a park but this place is awesome very clean and green you feel like you have stepped into a little enchanted
5193456 this gym is really great especially if you are comparing it to the la fitness crunch and ballys and other big box gyms the loft style is clean and
5193457 had a great time what a cool venue loved the patio space was great finally getting to meet some of you in person
5193458 that house was going up and going up quick it was big it was huge
5193459 he just about remodeled my whole house he was a good learner
5193460 he said he wasnt going to let it get him down
5193461 disparities in jury outcomes baltimore city vs three surrounding jurisdictions an empirical examination
5193462 the issue had been raised to us many times of whether it is difficult to convict people in the city
5193463 go behind the numbers to figure out why something is happening
5193464 we analyze cases not from a statistical standpoint but from a realistic standpoint
5193465 we look at how we can address issues that negatively impact on outcomes things like better training attorneys and police
5193466 we believe the report is very flawed and needs a lot of work if it is to be released as a definitive study on jury disparities
5193467 it is the combination of all of these factors which allows me to say with confidence that given the data limitations many of the differences among the jurisdictions have been accounted for
5193468 neutralize city residents negative perceptions of the criminal justice system
5193469 generally speaking citizens in the three comparison jurisdictions tend to be more advantaged in all respects than those in baltimore city they are better educated are wealthier and are more likely to own their own homes
5193470 are also less likely to suffer from the structural disadvantage and social disorganization which often results in the higher incidence of crime and victimization from crime
5193471 i am simply appalled that in the name of science and research you reach a conclusion that because a large number of city residents live in poverty and among crime they are incapable of performing their civic duty
5193472 more aggressively than other jurisdictions choosing to pursue the highest charge possible and allowing either the jury or the plea bargaining process to find the balancing point that would equalize the punishment of the defendant to fit the crime
5193473 there were holes the size of a dining room table in the roof
5193474 this iconic building is a symbol of hope for us
5193475 in it we saw the combination of the physical structure with the amazing human capital in this neighborhood the neighborhood needs work force development and has the motivation for change
5193476 as a student at the maryland institute in the 1970s i would go over and draw and photograph the place
5193477 even then i said to myself i want to do this building it is one of baltimores best historic monuments that hadnt been saved
5193478 when we started doing the work last year we found that despite its ornamented exterior the brewery is really an industrial machine constructed around the grain silo the conveyor belts and the heating kettles
5193479 its been a huge privilege to work on this project
5193480 they had their patron saint of their province and they honored him over there in italy and they brought the tradition over here it has a long history
5193481 the key to keeping it going is to get the younger generation to work with the older generation but dont make the older generation feel like they are getting thrown out
5193482 the torch has been passed on from generation to generation
5193483 it is getting old and fragile we have tried to have it mended a couple of times
5193484 it lasted two weeks they blocked off the streets there were amusement rides there were bingo tables in the streets you always had something to do every night for two weeks in august people here really supported it it was a much bigger neighborhood with more families

5193486 wedding planning is economy proof brides are going to spend the money

5193489 we get a lot of people who arent willing to pay what they used to
5193490 theyre not going to be willing to compromise on a lot
5193491 a clue to why non smokers contract tobacco related diseases such as lung cancer may have been found free radicals in the air have similar affects to harmful substances in tobacco smoke inhaling pollutants exposes the average person to up to 300 times more free radicals than smoking 1 cigarette
5193492 healthy growth in bilateral trade with various countries reflecting the growing confidence in the trade infrastructure and opportunities offered by dubai
5193493 while exports in terms of carats grew marginally in the first half of 2008 the price of diamonds rose by 10 and helped push the overall trade to high levels
5193494 we have been also witnessing a sharp increase in rough diamond inventories held in dubai which underlines dubais status as a major distribution conduit for leading manufacturing markets
5193495 this years report card shines a harsh and frankly unflattering light on the attitudes we canadians have concerning mental health

5193498 we cannot literally believe that p and that not p but there is no contradiction in both wanting to perform an action or to have an object and wanting not to do the action or not to have the object
5193499 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5193500 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5193501 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5193502 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5193503 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5193504 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5193505 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5193506 there are a couple of reconciliations on the show we left last season off not on best terms with everyone things have gotten better since but they got worse before they got better

5193560 i think alice and tasha are on a rocky road at the moment they may not make it they are not like bette and tina they dont really have a special connection
5193561 last year our results against the top teams were excellent but ive just reminded them that i want them to enjoy the weekend but we have a big game next weekend and i want them to treat everyone the same
5193562 i thought our performance was outstanding i thought we controlled the game apart from the first 10 or 15 minutes we defended excellently and played some decent stuff
5193563 i dont usually pick players out but although chris taylor has got the two goals i though reuben hazell and sean gregan dominated two awkward strikers in jermaine beckford and enoch showunmi that was part of a very good team performance
5193564 i think teams look at us anyway they know we arent a pushover and are as good as any team on our day
5193565 abends staut sich schon heute der verkehr ich m chte nicht wissen wie das nach den ferien wird

5193567 in football theres times when things dont go well and sometimes you play games where you say they did something tactical we couldnt cope with or they were technically better i dont think it was any of those i think it was a case of us not having any players who were at it today
5193568 ive got to be thinking thats a bit of a freak things have been excellent in the last two or three weeks with a good start at scunthorpe and backing it up with a decent performance at chester but we dropped off the pace today
5193569 it was purely down to performance level it simply wasnt good enough the anger is burning away in me so im going to reflect watch the game have a chat with the coaching staff and then well sort it out
5193570 we cant go pointing fingers at any particular individual it was one to 11
5193571 its an excellent game against the biggest club in our division ive said it before but these are the games you want to play in
5193572 theyre a massive club and therell be a massive crowd but their players dont frighten me and thats not being disrespectful and i think we can go there and give a good account of ourselves
5193573 i think therell be over 30 000 supporters there theyre very passionate fans who expect them to go up this season so weve got to go there and show were a decent team
5193574 i know its going to be a very hard game if they get on top so its important we go there and keep the fans quiet take control of the game and get the job done
5193575 id be happy putting any of this squad in if i was a player id love to be put in for a game like that
5193576 i thought deane smalley was excellent the other night i didnt want to take him off but it was a tactical decision even though he wa sone of our better players in my eyes
5193577 he didnt play the first game but came in and ive told him i want him pushing lidds andy liddell and lidds to push him

5193604 i called and spoke to popov and he said he could not get to the office because his car had a flat tyre
5193605 this was preposterous i said the delegation must have more cars he said there is another car but its tyre is flat too at this point i knew it was a trap and i was very angry
5193606 he said he could not control the south ossetians while there was georgian military on the boundary he said we must declare a unilateral ceasefire before the russians could push them back
5193607 russia had devised a premeditated exercise to humiliate its georgias envoy during his trip to tskhinvali and in the heat of the moment the flat tyre was interpreted as a contemptuous first move for a well planned invasion

5193664 higher unintended pregnancy rates reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high quality contraceptive services and using their methods of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time
5193665 since 1882 until 1968 3 446 black americans were lynched here in the u s and that number is surpassed in three 3 days by abortion 5
5193666 if it is just as much an unjustifiable homicide to kill an innocent person of color as it is to kill an innocent white person a poor person as a rich one a sickly person as a healthy person it is just as much an unjustifiable homocide deliberately to kill a human fetus as it is to kill deliberately a human infant or adult
5193667 is the reason why a woman goes into an abortion clinic to kill her
5193668 might help reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy and the number of legal induced abortions in the united states

5193682 bruce djites eight goals in seven matches for his new club was too good to ignore as socceroos coach pim verbeek added the genclerbirligi striker to the london based australian squad the socceroos face south africa in a world cup warm up match at qprs loftus road on wednesday morning djite joins olyroos mark milligan uncontracted david carney sheffield united and matthew spiranovic nurnberg plus richard garcia hull city as late call ups for the clash the quintet have replaced michael beauchamp aalborg denmark brett emerton blackburn and harry kewell galatasaray who have all pulled out of international friendly

5193687 the situation in the post soviet area has changed significantly
5193688 russia is ready and able to use force outside its borders thats a different situation
5193689 the only oil at stake is whats flowing through the btc pipeline to turkey something that involves many big western oil companies and if russia were to do anything to disrupt that it would become a pariah in europe
5193690 it will shrink russias ability to operate in foreign policy
5193691 they always closely follow who is the boss who is stronger
5193692 if they come to the conclusion that the u s is less strong now than before i cant exclude that they will turn their attention more to russia or to china
5193693 once the dust settles we can then look at assisting georgia in rebuilding their military
5193694 uniseeds investment will now accelerate the development of these companies and enable them to prove up the potential of their technologies

5193699 were sure that the russians started the fires in our woods
5193700 local people say that the fires were started by russian helicopters they flew over the forests and then the fires started
5193701 now the russians are not allowing aviation teams from ukraine and turkey to help put out the fires
5193702 this is the biggest coniferous forest in the caucasus and is home to chamois bears and the caucasus red deer
5193703 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
5193704 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighbouring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
5193705 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilisation scenario in crimea
5193706 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
5193707 its quiet there but now there are problems with food

5193710 i think the world should think very carefully about what is going on here
5193711 we need to stop everything that can be stopped now
5193712 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
5193713 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its stations with governments with an interest in receiving data of the situation in space
5193714 there is no chance of resignation he will defend himself against the allegations and defend his position
5193715 i came here especially to see him i am devastated i just bought one ticket the olympics is over for me as well as liu xiang
5193716 we have started to dream that china could surpass the sporting hegemony of the united states and become world number one in the number of gold medals
5193717 sentiment towards european growth has been steadily deteriorating putting downward pressure on the euro
5193718 currency players are still factoring in how bad the european economy will be
5193719 he had been sought by police for over a week after he allegedly stabbed his south african girlfriend to death
5193720 this has brought in battles that have divided the movement and cast doubt on its integrity
5193721 there is nothing that prevents people from pursuing wealth accumulation for as long as this is done within the confines of the law and not at the expense of the organisation
5193722 weve kind of thrown the same type of game out again very little offence and the pitching was absolutely great
5193723 you have to tip your cap to the pitcher sometime but it gets to a point where youve got to make things happen
5193724 it was a game we had to have it was a must game for us and again we just couldnt generate the offence when it was needed
5193725 i was giving him a fastball that i wanted him to either swing at and put in play or take for a strike
5193726 i didnt want to fall behind 3 0 so i gave him one to hit it was a little bit higher than id like and he put a pretty good swing on it
5193727 some big situations came up and i couldnt get the job done
5193728 its going to be a lot better going home 3 4 with four losses in one run games than if we were 1 6 and just kind of threw in the towel
5193729 there are never friends in politics individuals have friends countries dont their interests are too complicated
5193730 you try to be polite to everyone while maintaining your independence
5193731 for us theres nothing really black and white you cant trust everyone and you cant distrust everyone
5193732 maybe we could be the answer to the clash of civilizations
5193733 on the one hand interest in our oil makes us more secure and on the other it makes us more vulnerable
5193734 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5193735 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5193736 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons
5193737 with so many gen yers still living at home with mum and dad its not surprising they are less affected by an economic downturn in comparison to home owners and young families
5193738 and the cooking skills they have been taught at home have well and truly come to waste with 29 per cent spending more on takeaways
5193739 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5193740 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5193741 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5193742 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5193743 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5193744 i would say that by the terrorist attacks of september 11 the market was already well on its way down but that helped give it a final push
5193745 its been driven by a cycle of interest rates but also growth differentials moving in favour of one country versus another
5193746 whether its his last game or not this week well wait and see because with the amount of injuries weve got he will probably be forced to play against geelong
5193747 this game against the hawks was more than likely going to be it but the way were going with injuries more than likely hell have to front up against geelong
5193748 it was always tentative with everything that was said about his last game even this week so hes happy to continue on and see the year out
5193749 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5193750 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5193751 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies
5193752 the fire started in the kitchen just after 3am on monday morning and then spread to the reception area
5193753 so far 20 units have burnt down and the fire is still raging
5193754 i understand that they refurbished the resort two months ago so the damage would run into millions of rands
5193755 any industry that needs to measure flow fields droplet and solid particle size and velocity such as mining paints food drying pharmaceuticals automotive fuel combustion to name a few will find the more accurate data we can now produce extremely helpful for understanding and improving product performance
5193756 achieving strong product performance whilst minimising environmental impact is a major priority for most businesses these days
5193757 the range of testing services we can offer has now expanded each laser system uses a different approach to measurement and measures different things the equipment we have makes it possible for our research to help industry clients meet their regulatory obligations as well as their business objectives
5193758 commercialising uqs intellectual and scientific assets in this way offers mutual benefits the researchers are helping to address real world problems faced by todays industries whilst generating an additional revenue stream to fund their vital basic research

5193766 dies ist ein kleiner schritt f r einen menschen ein gro er schritt f r die menschheit
5193767 marxism with entrepreneurs substituted for proletarians as the heroic subjects of history
5193768 well the spot was good but then i noticed the post coital phase starting to pop so i used my and i kilt em
5193769 it is a great property but it simply didnt fit into our plans for 2009
5193770 all political parties all right thinking people must work together to bring the situation under control
5193771 everybody has an obligation to contribute all political parties as i said from the ramparts of the red fort this is not a partisan issue
5193772 we are regularly in touch with sikh communities in north america europe and asia who want us to deliver programs in their local communities on a regular basis but its been quite difficult due to logistical and financial constraints
5193773 sauda bazi nahin chalegi nahin chalegi a sellout will not be acceptable
5193774 it is an extremely difficult situation there are protests in both downtown and uptown localities of srinagar against us
5193775 we fear the anger of the people might even turn against us we had planned to hold the procession at the tourist reception centre grounds and then take a small group of people to deliver a memorandum at the un office now things look difficult
5193776 this infuriated the people we have already made it clear that the strike is suspended only for three days
5193777 when you play so nicely like this i think you deserve a big hug special treat extra privilege
5193778 if you dont settle down ill have to ask you to leave the room and return when you can stay here quietly
5193779 the shepherd doesnt leave his flock when the wolf comes
5193780 the ways of hashem are always good you know yaely about this we do not question

5193782 she has died the good woman mrs lia waldman daughter of the nagybaner rav may her soul be entwined in the bouquet of life
5193783 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
5193784 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
5193785 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
5193786 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear

5193896 but this did not happen right away it has taken years for our initial cult audience to grow into a pop culture phenomenon just this past halloween we had some girls show up at the house in nightmare before christmas costumes and my wife and i pointed out one of the original jack skellington and the skellington reindeer puppets which was in our office it blew their minds and they screamed with joy taking their handfuls of candy and went away just full of life
5193897 over the next two or three quarters we expect uk gdp growth to be slightly negative or zero satisfying the conditions of technical recession
5193898 but the bigger danger of a major uk recession can and must be prevented
5193899 our central scenario envisages that uk bank rate would be cut to 4 75 in the fourth quarter of 2008 followed by an additional cut to 4 5 in the first quarter of 2009
5193900 but if the bank of englands monetary policy committee decides not to cut rates in the next three to six months growth prospects would be worse
5193901 full impact of going into a major recession as we did in the early 1990s could be avoided now
5193902 to get back to a a path of steady growth
5193903 major dislocation and major problems emerging from a deep recession
5193904 a marked slowdown in uk activity is highly likely over the next 18 months
5193905 a very sharp deceleration in consumer spending growth in reaction to falling house prices and the acute squeeze on household disposable incomes
5193906 begin again very much in the spirit of what christopher nolan did with batman
5193907 a bit of a sequel and a prequel because it tells the story of how we got there
5193908 we wanted everything to feel different and rejuvenated and hopefully that was incredible the t 800 is from 2029 this is 2018 we have not come to the technology of the t 800 t 1000 and the tx 2029 is earliest we ever saw the future so in 2018 we see the state of the war at that period
5193909 we didn t want a bunch of lilly white people running around calling the shots said mcg in san diego last month
5193910 there s a line in t1 where reese talks about the t 600 s being easy to spot and this film takes place in the time period of those t 600 s the idea was soviet tank when thinking about the t 600 designs
5193911 all kinds of new machines harvesters transports aerostats hydrobots done in a greasy grimey brutal soviet tank design you ll see giant machines stalking through the landscape harvesting people
5193912 i dont know how much im allowed to say but im a very bad person
5193913 i still don t know how it will play out with this one

5193918 the dvd release of wall e will include a short film would be very connected to wall e pixar has done this in past releases with mike s car on monster s inc jack jack attack on the incredibles mater and the ghostlight with cars and your friend the rat on ratatouille which wall e himself has an animated cameo in the short film on wall e will be titled burn e in the feature film there is a sequence where eve and wall e fly around the axiom starliner and enter through a door locking a poor welder bot on the outside of the ship the bot bangs his fists against the door after he realizes that he has been locked out you can watch a clip of the sequence here apparently the welder bot is actually named burn e complete with a logo on the side of his head

5193924 lenders have been lambasted from all sides the financial services authority has accused them of treating customers unfairly and not helping people through their difficulties and the citizens advice bureau accused them of aggressive behaviour and using court action as a first rather than last resort
5193925 if lenders had provided more affordable mortgage ppi policies that match my prices i suspect more people would be able to keep their homes although not all those struggling to make repayments have lost an income due to redundancy it is a key factor homeowners who lose their wage could wait up to nine months for any government help in meeting their mortgage payments as support has been delayed from six months if they had ppi they would receive back to day one payments and have their mortgage repayments met for up to a year
5193926 i worry far more families than this will be affected which is why lenders must act now and stop offering cover that is at least four times more expensive than mine
5193927 this cover wont solve everyones financial problems but it will at least help those who do face the threat of redundancy lenders have a duty of care to make this insurance affordable and easily accessible
5193928 there has never been a better time to buy used cars in south africa the booming new car sales market over the last four years has resulted in a huge used car market this combined with affordability pressures has driven prices of used cars down there are many good deals to be had as long as you know what you are buying
5193929 the best way to obtain maximum value when buying a used car is to buy privately because both buyer and seller get the best deal
5193930 when you start looking do your research have a look at the aa car annual other car buyers guides and classified adverts to get an idea of what you can get in your price range taking into account the model and mileage
5193931 it is always a good idea to take someone with you who is knowledgeable about cars when you start looking always look at the car in daylight and take a good look this may seem obvious but the heart often overrules the head and dont be afraid to ask questions
5193932 there is no fool proof way of buying a used car but sticking to things like checking the cars paperwork and service record paying for a mechanical check negotiating for a lower price and shopping around for the best deal can ensure that consumers do get value for money
5193933 nowhere in my best dreams can i imagine something like what i did this year
5193934 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5193935 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5193936 the reason probably i won this title is because i have a fantastic time here enjoying a lot in the village that was amazing experience for me
5193937 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
5193938 youve got to take care of this to move on
5193939 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5193940 they hit a lot of three pointers and love to drive and kick out for the open shot
5193941 i think most of us grew up watching these girls i think i was 10 years old when lisa leslie played in her first olympics it was a good experience i think we played pretty well all things considered
5193942 i have tried to make it more of a cricketers almanack
5193943 you might worry about adam gilchrist say butchering an attack and smashing a bowler to smithereens
5193944 but lara made captains and bowlers look silly if you knew you were going to die youd prefer a single bludgeoning blow to the head or a quick bullet to the brain rather than death by a thousand ever so precise cuts
5193945 when the light catches the speakers spectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind them
5193946 it may well be that the connection between riches and happiness is looser than most economic and political commentators
5193947 we were clear on friday when we met the icc task force weve had extensive discussions with them and with our players association and our view quite simply is we need now to see where the icc choose to go with this
5193948 it is getting very late its about 20 days now to the start of the event but the icc are the ones who are in control of both the detail in pakistan and the possible alternate venue
5193949 im sure we all understand its their the iccs position now theyve gone out and weve met the task force and that was the purpose of our meetings last week
5193950 we had all of our senior staff there coach tim nielson senior players and the purpose of the meeting was to receive information which we did
5193951 we had a chat and they went home and were very thankful for the way the meeting ran so were rally now in their hands
5193952 its an important time for cricket everyones identified that including players and administrators
5193953 but as was the case throughout my career you just take the advice of the experts in the security field and thats what cricket australia and the players association are continuing to do
5193954 and the players will trust that opinion i have no doubt about that thats what theyre all indicating
5193955 throughout my whole playing career i was only ever told by cricket australia that if youve got circumstances that you believe you are unable to tour a venue or go on any tour you dont have to go
5193956 the important issue now is for us to work with the icc we are not in the business of going to players and asking their answers prior to us making a decision
5193957 once weve ascertained where cricket needs to be obviously its important for us were great supporters of pakistan cricket and were very comfortable in making sure the icc have all the information from cricket australia
5193958 the most amazing thing i saw was bolts poise for a guy as young as he is 21 on the olympic stage
5193959 it was truly amazing how poised he was so relaxed and confident
5193960 one thing that helped bolts confidence was he ran a 9
5193961 the thing that amazes me about bolt is that with his frame hes able to be even or ahead of the field after 40 meters when youre over 6 feet tall you are running people down starting slow and having to come from behind
5193962 i ran against steve williams steve riddick they were 6 3 6 4 and they came out and got you at the end we shorter sprinters like glance were always ahead early
5193963 the only thing bolt did wrong was ease up at the tape from the blocks to 70 meters he couldnt have executed more perfectly from the blocks to 70 meters i have not seen anyone in the history of our sport do what he did
5193964 i won an olympic gold for the second time i prepared very well and its easy to run all my dreams came true im so happy for myself and my country
5193965 i did well in the first 300 meters and stayed relaxed from there
5193966 the final is going to be tough christine ohuruogu of great britain looked great in the first round
5193967 i was so calm and relaxed in the warm ups
5193968 i was feeling great i knew i was going to go through to the final sadly i did not i will be disappointed not to make the final i let people down if i let them down it means i didnt do my best
5193969 ive been wearing my shoes longer than him every day i look at my gold shoes and say you cant be wearing gold shoes and not be winning
5193970 its the first gold medal for slovenia in the track and field events
5193971 this is my dream come true you cant go out and say you will win a medal you must make it happen
5193972 i had a little bit of hope inside of me
5193973 but seeing how beautifully she executed her routine i knew
5193974 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
5193975 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
5193976 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
5193977 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
5193978 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
5193979 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days
5193980 im sure someday ill appreciate what i did i still have to get to that step
5193981 going into week 3 this is the only game that we game plan in the preseason
5193982 the rest of the games we just kind of do what were doing that week so we throw in the full game plan and we treat it like the regular season
5193983 when guys are in the training room theyre not out here practicing youve got to be willing to release them and live with it and pick up other people for more competition
5193984 in the end if it becomes something where javon is not playing as well as we need him to play both of those guys have learned x so they can go over there
5193985 i dont feel the need to do that right now i expect javon to have a big game im putting in a game plan and he should see some balls early in this game hopefully hell make some plays
5193986 we worked hard every day but the result was as you see and its really hard to take
5193987 it was really inspiring to see those women so cool when they were neck and neck
5193988 we knew we could produce a gold medal winning night it was just can we do it on that day we just decided we can do this we wanted to make our mark in history
5193989 we dropped a little too much at the start but we werent too worried about it
5193990 im not disappointed with bronze its always good to come away with a medal
5193991 at the final point when we reached the finishing line i was very very excited and i thought to myself finally we have won this gold for china
5193992 this is for the 1984 girls weve got to do them proud
5193993 if i can do some magic with a pass i do it
5193994 i have a better feel for osullivans abilities with the two games weve played
5193995 i feel good about what were doing with smith and hill from the repetition standpoint
5193996 this is something that will stick with me the rest of my career
5193997 i wish it wasnt the last one but it is the last one i wish bay meadows wasnt closing i wish it would be here for a couple more years
5193998 a lot of my career has been spent at bay meadows so its nice to get the last win there
5193999 this might be a pretty nice filly that we have there shes developing rapidly
5194000 my wife and i raised our family in san mateo
5194001 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5194002 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5194003 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try to win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5194004 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5194005 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5194006 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5194007 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum
5194008 karena itu salah satu buku yang menginspirasi saya untuk selalu optimis sama apapun
5194009 there is no chance of resignation he will defend himself against the allegations and defend his position
5194010 the goal was to start sectarian violence with the car bombs
5194011 there used to be a whole brigade here and now its less soon these policies will backfire in tal afar and allow terrorists to come in
5194012 we used to depend mostly on coalition forces but unfortunately the footprint of the u s has been reduced
5194013 as the iraqi units stood up over the past 18 months they took over our bases
5194014 we confirmed that they could operate in company and battalion strength
5194015 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week
5194016 i came here especially to see him i am devastated i just bought one ticket the olympics is over for me as well as liu xiang
5194017 we have started to dream that china could surpass the sporting hegemony of the united states and become world number one in the number of gold medals
5194018 i dont know if i should cry smile or jump i dont know
5194019 i think this is a fabulous thing for the three of us to win the medals and for jamaica to get one two three its about time weve been waiting for this
5194020 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence
5194021 people are afraid to leave their house after 7 p m
5194022 i am still a student but this was an order from the commander of the academy that we should come out and search the vehicles
5194023 they can give us insights into their countries and cultures and the way people speak and think in their languages that can prevent the united states from making tactical or strategic mistakes its hugely important
5194024 there will continue to be people who are extremely apprehensive since we know for a fact that the reputation of our country abroad has unfortunately been tarnished in recent years
5194025 but if people like him have their eye on the ball and can do a better job engaging with our community i think there is a lot we can achieve together
5194026 his background helps him be more receptive to people like me when i tell him something it resonates
5194027 i have seen many great amazing people just give up on working in the intelligence community because it is such an arduous bureaucratic mess that often sees suspicion where it shouldnt
5194028 as a person from another culture i can translate the information to a western audience i can help decision makers know why a policy might be good or bad to help them take into account political and economic sensibilities and know what an arab perspective might be on an issue
5194029 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5194030 we continue to have concerns in particular for these eight children which is why we have asked the judge to review the case
5194031 whether the children are in any immediate danger simply because their parents choose to raise them in this religion
5194032 the substance of what theyre doing here is fundamentally the same
5194033 yeah we just had a tornado with 105 mph winds back home
5194034 la pedana veramente magica e ci tenevo a centrare anche questa finale dopo quelle europea e mondiale tecnicamente ho sentito subito che il martello stava volando lontano e ci voleva dopo una stagione difficile con un avvicinamento allolimpiade complicato da problemi fisici ma ora sono qui e in forma
5194035 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5194036 of course we were pressing because were not scoring the runs were capable of scoring
5194037 that stuff becomes contagious its frustrating but weve still got a lot of baseball to play
5194038 ive got to turn it on so i can show the young guys that its not as hard as were making it
5194039 ive been through this process forever when you have streaks like this you have to find that one at bat or two at bats in a row that gets that confidence level back up
5194040 when youve got a pitcher with a fastball like that and you give him a lead it makes it easier on him
5194041 he had the opportunity to stay aggressive because it was such a big margin
5194042 theyre letting it fly right now and were waiting to get into a certain count to take those kinds of swings
5194043 weve got a lot of young guys who are being exposed to the scouts right now theyre wondering why theyre getting the same pitches in the same counts and thats not going to change until they start making adjustments
5194044 its a growing process but weve got to continue to fight
5194045 he had a bad last season at marseille because he had meningitis and spent two weeks in hospital
5194046 the year before everyone wanted him but sometimes you have to be brave enough when everyone else says he is not good
5194047 he had made an impression that i kept with me i had seen things in him and i had to go with my beliefs
5194048 marc overmars was in a similar situation before he came to arsenal and hopefully nasri can have the same impact here
5194049 there is a bit of robert pires in him as he is able to change direction very easily
5194050 has gradually morphed from being about the humanity of the guard to being about the christian faith of the guard and john mccain
5194051 i didnt have a rhythm on the mound i had to make an adjustment i was more comfortable going to the stretch it helped me out
5194052 i had done it in college this is the first time i did it in professional baseball
5194053 itd be nice if they were all in one year
5194054 when i came up two years ago even though i had some good at bats i felt like a deer in the headlights i just hoped the ball would find the bat
5194055 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5194056 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5194057 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies
5194058 with so many gen yers still living at home with mum and dad its not surprising they are less affected by an economic downturn in comparison to home owners and young families
5194059 and the cooking skills they have been taught at home have well and truly come to waste with 29 per cent spending more on takeaways
5194060 whether its his last game or not this week well wait and see because with the amount of injuries weve got he will probably be forced to play against geelong
5194061 this game against the hawks was more than likely going to be it but the way were going with injuries more than likely hell have to front up against geelong
5194062 it was always tentative with everything that was said about his last game even this week so hes happy to continue on and see the year out
5194063 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5194064 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5194065 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons
5194066 sentiment towards european growth has been steadily deteriorating putting downward pressure on the euro
5194067 currency players are still factoring in how bad the european economy will be
5194068 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5194069 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5194070 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5194071 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5194072 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5194073 kogu sealne ostmiskeskkond ja kaupade v ljapanek on klubilik n ituselik midagi hoopis muud kui tavalises lohakalt t is topitud kiirmoepoes
5194074 me polnud keskendunud p dsime m ngu tagasi tulla aga vastastel oli juba hoog sees oleme head vaid siis kui keskendume 100 protsenti
5194075 l hen sellele sprindile ja ka paide rallile 22 23 augustil jah ma teen seda spetsiaalselt ei ole laiksoo nimi rallinimekirjast maas
5194076 kuidas ei pidanud s na pidasin ju teisel katsel lubasin asjaga hele poole saada
5194077 i walked in there and i fell it was dark and i didnt know when i was going to stop
5194078 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5194079 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5194080 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5194081 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5194082 i dont fault the department of justice for using what legal authority they have if a clear criminal act has been committed but i do think that it would be preferable for crimes committed on active duty be prosecuted by court martial rather than in civilian courts
5194083 i think maybe what it says is we need to rethink the question of military personnel who are subject to prosecution
5194084 nazario said that he was asked are they dead yet
5194085 ive put in applications everywhere for everything but nobody wants to hire you if you have been indicted
5194086 my faith in the system is shaken theres no doubt about that
5194087 there are no bodies no forensic evidence no crime scene and no identities
5194088 we organize medical exercises and meetings at the ann myers medical center in second life now the e learning faculty of imperial college london created a spectacular and useful second life tool in medical education here are some screenshots that can describe what the learning process looks like
5194089 though the film industry is very dear to me i will not sail in two boats but i will not back off from acting in message oriented and educative movies
5194090 it would have been a historic mistake if i did not take a decision to get into politics
5194091 i am not here for power i dedicate myself to the cause of the poor
5194092 there is a political vacuum and people want a change
5194093 a homeguard in khammam committed suicide due to financial reason in his suicide note he expressed regrets of not being able to vote for chiranjeevi the actor who was born in a constables family said
5194094 our party will work for santhoshaandhra pradesh a happy andhra pradesh he said on issues like separate statehood to telangana he said it was a sensitive issue and a decision would be taken after scientific analysis
5194095 we had 5 acres agricultural land he said to a query if he knew anything about agriculture
5194096 i do not know what a blood group is but i know blood is essential to save a life i do not know what politics is but i certainly know that peoples issues come first he said minorities and women issues would also be part of his agenda
5194097 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5194098 the community had been raising red flags for months and sometimes years
5194099 its a mystery to us how you can have the number of inspectors that were practically living in that building and have that level of disaster
5194100 it exposed an area that the city had never looked at this comprehensively when we looked at it we found a lot of areas that could be improved
5194101 this wasnt any building this was a public spectacle this was a high rise toxic vacant building that was under deconstruction
5194102 we cannot afford to have anyone else lose their life
5194103 if that means its going to take a little bit longer to take the building down then its going to take a little bit longer
5194104 we get to talk to people from all over the world they actually go crazy when they see us
5194105 they cant believe this is happening in america that in a big city like fort worth theres a cowboy walking down the street or on the back of a horse
5194106 they have to stick together thats the main thing with the cattle drives
5194107 if we was trying to take two head down the street they would probably run off on us but if we take them all or eight to 10 at least theyll all stick together
5194108 where else can you go to sit on a horse and look cool all day
5194109 you get to meet and greet all kinds of people from all over the world you definitely dont have a boring day here
5194110 i will do things differently so that the benefits of development reach the last man in the queue andhra pradesh is the richest state but its people are the poorest i will work to fill the growing gap between the rich and the poor after 30 years in the glamorous film world i have decided that my path goes towards politics to serve the people i dedicate myself to the service of the people
5194111 its a good way to attract families so that they can learn about you know small steps they can take to reduce their carbon footprint
5194112 weve tried to replace light bulbs we can probably encourage more recyclable materials with our vendors
5194113 because were a fair we like things bright and shiny lights running and colorful
5194114 a lot of them used to just leave them running all night because it looks nice
5194115 the rides that come in when youre talking about the types and sizes of exhibit buildings that we have it is a massive undertaking
5194116 we still had to use regular electricity to work the fans the misters to keep all the animals cool
5194117 its hard to go completely green but thats not to say that little things cant be done here or there
5194118 we found that to work better because the public doesnt necessarily know the different bins
5194119 the most important element is if theyre really taking it seriously or if theyre just paying lip service

5194124 running a plant day to day no matter what is challenging but we are ambitious and determined to restore it
5194125 it would be great to have the plant but have it run by a different company or a different family
5194126 theres a lot of ups and downs when you are recruiting so quickly
5194127 its a process thats evolving every day were constantly building
5194128 coming in within six weeks with enough people to get the plant to full capacity isnt a challenge its nearly impossible
5194129 i raised a fuss and i think im going to start next week
5194130 but some of those guys just got sent on a bus right back home
5194131 you see it and you are reminded of your commitment to do good
5194132 it is a struggle something we must deal with but with enough money and the right time and if we stay the course theres no reason we cant get there
5194133 another few weary steps and there was nothing above us but the sky
5194134 to this day it thrills me to know that if i can get the program right it will always work perfectly every time just the way i told it to experiencing this thrill was the beginning of my fascination with software
5194135 theres nothing like the eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before i wont compare it to sex but it lasts longer
5194136 my feet are still on the ground im just wearing better shoes
5194137 ive read that i flew up the hills and mountains of france but you dont fly up a hill you struggle slowly and painfully and maybe if you work very hard you get to the top ahead of everybody else
5194138 what is behind it is the years of passion and dedication and hard work
5194139 being near or at the top certainly requires an enormous amount of time and effort and it doesnt come without collateral cost
5194140 its not a 9 to 5 job something elsewhere is going to have to suffer
5194141 as i stood in front of all of you for years in victory i stand in front of you today
5194142 ah how could i possibly admit such an infirmity in the one sense which should have been more perfect in me than in others
5194143 soon i would have to deal with something i had not known in my entire life pressure the pressure to defend my position the pressure to carry myself like a man and champion the pressure to meet demands and obligations that came with my new station and wealth the pressure to take on the obligations that come with being a professional anything and most demanding of all the pressure to win day after day round after round to hold my new position and potentially improve on it
5194144 let him have that monkey on his back for the next 25 30 35 years its not an easy thing
5194145 most of my friends thought i was a lot cooler i guess
5194146 it would kind of just be nice to be a regular person again
5194147 you plow ahead and make a hit and you plow on and someone passes you then someone passes them time levels
5194148 when you think of life as a living active process i dont think its a pleasurable activity unless you have some challenge in that life no matter what it is
5194149 i think in a way that is the philosophy of life
5194150 when im with a group of kids now they just yell out thats the cooking man
5194151 i walk down the streets of san francisco and every kid recognizes me and stops me and says hello you know thats really a wonderful thing
5194152 he knows how great he is but at the same time hes very humble
5194153 hes shocked to see how people still love him and remember him you see his eyes light up and it takes him back a moment when they chant ali ali its like charging a battery up

5194157 looking at the current scenario it is highly unlikely that the market price of companies would anyway touch their conversion price and so it is possible that investors may not opt for conversion

5194165 no one should ever think about buying a property before taking this class

5194172 this isnt a problem specific to this bank foreign exchange reserves for settling trade accounts are in short supply in cuba
5194173 the first half of the year has been excellent and there is no reason why the second half should not be good barring the extraordinary
5194174 i love that moment when a show is firing on all cylinders in a room full of people who are having a great time but the rest of it is really irritating come on why are we sitting in the dark we all know its only a play so get on with it i hate what stephen daldry once called burglars theatre you know suddenly everything goes dark and people in black called stage hands creep on and steal vases and things if you are going to ask people to be stuck in the dark youve got to surprise them i try to make my plays events not plays with lots of things happening

5194182 yogic breathing or pranayama revitalizes the entire body balances the emotions and promotes clarity of mind all the breathing exercises described here are performed sitting down keeping the spine neck and head in a straight line this will facilitate the flow of prana and create the space for the lungs to expand more fully

5194185 as we felt new power flow in as we enjoyed peace of mind as we discovered we could face life successfully as we became conscious of his presence we began to lose our fear of today tomorrow or the hereafter we were reborn
5194186 the concept of energy and the flow of that energy in the human body is the core of the current explosion in healing
5194187 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life
5194188 the next real estate crisis by april 2009 hundreds of thousands of option arm mortgages will begin resetting bringing on a fresh wave of foreclosures
5194189 among the states expected to be worst hit is already battered california about 60 percent of the outstanding option arm loans in the u s were sold to california homeowners according to credit suisse
5194190 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5194191 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5194192 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5194193 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5194194 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5194198 e como que ficar a petrobras foi gra as petrobras que o brasil est descobrindo esse petr leo e agora querem tirar isso dela
5194199 it will go up as the investigation proceeds i dare say its already increased
5194200 we need to eliminate the legislative surpluses and invest them in our commonwealths needs
5194201 we all get tarred it makes the whole legislature and its process look absolutely awful
5194202 im about 10 years behind the technology revolution if someone asks me can you get on the internet i say yes in about 60 seconds and i call david yarkin
5194203 those who have known him for so long know that the computer was not part of his world 20 years ago and we could have predicted with absolute accuracy that it wouldnt be part of his world 20 years later
5194204 hes still a guy who says fax that to me
5194205 what he doesnt understand is that people dont get them instantaneously
5194206 he doesnt pay us to include him in the process he pays us to run the process and he makes the decision
5194207 theres something about putting your words with your own hand on paper
5194208 thats better i think than putting them on a machine it feels good and if you write something out the ability to remember it is far greater
5194209 he takes a stack of papers home and always comes back the next day with them all marked up its better than someone using a blackberry on the fly
5194210 now that i know how to text i think thats the next thing im going to learn
5194211 you need a very serious consumer advocate with our rapid growth we are going to see upward pressure to raise rates on utilities
5194212 coal is up to 90 a ton natural gas and oil costs are rising i believe renewable energy is the future and arizona could become the solar power
5194213 the company must make a profit but at what price to the consumer can a company make up for bad management
5194214 i was proud of that vote then and i am today
5194215 im an advocate for renewables if demand is not satisfied by renewables of course as a commissioner i have a responsibility to consider nuclear and other sources
5194216 we wouldnt have the investment we do in solar etc if it hadnt been put in place
5194217 cost is a factor but as we use renewables increasingly the cost will come down the acc has taken a lead on this issue
5194218 i dont want to be a tool for the utilities
5194219 were totally addicted to fossil fuels we need to develop alternative fuels
5194220 ive never seen such volatility in the market in energy it makes perfect sense to switch to clean economic energy not only for the environment but also for the economy
5194221 the administration is a bit behind the curve on this they didnt understand what was coming
5194222 theres a whole number of issues they deliberately engineer to show they are an important power
5194223 they interpret weakness as a sign that they can go further
5194224 when you have a loss of life it really elevates things
5194225 there may have been more olympians in 2004 but there were a lot more dead people in iraq too now violence is down 80 percent those are more important numbers
5194226 why should fdr have attended a ceremony created solely to give respectability to nazi germany sports above politics was the sports boycott of south africa which hastened the end of apartheid wrong
5194227 very funny stuff as he is under extenuating the effect of his most powerful weapon of choice
5194228 now hes playing again hes back to being a little boy
5194229 for the kids theyre coming from a place of such instability
5194230 when this opened they were so excited it was christmas in july
5194231 we expect the numbers of homeless families with children will increase with the economy being the way it is
5194232 families are the fastest growing portion of the homeless population
5194233 but we dont want to have to have kids playing on it for too long
5194234 many of the children here have few if any possessions
5194235 theyve made the playground their own before it opened the kids were playing in the parking lot this is a way to insert a little normalcy in their lives
5194236 they spend a lot of time in places that arent safe around outdoor dangers and they know theyre different from other children this lets the kids be kids they can revel in the opportunity to participate in something for their age
5194237 spread to his bones he was confined to bed on five liters of oxygen and had two central lines in his chest wall to deliver medications directly to his heart
5194238 we have no indication mr desplanques was ever sick or bedridden
5194239 no explanation was provided to explain why the defendant was able to check out of the hospice yet was unable to appear for his court date
5194240 he was not attempting to get the drug fentanyl with any malicious intent or even for himself
5194241 obviously were always looking for places to expand now we have moved forward with purchasing that land
5194242 it could be that were starting to create a safety culture for our roadways
5194243 i dont think they could have gotten a better candidate if he had run against giffords last time when the seat was open he might have beaten her
5194244 within the time that the republican brand name nationwide and within arizona is in peril
5194245 youve got to assume at this point in time that giffords is the front runner and has the advantage of incumbency
5194246 ive got some of the top leaders and campaign volunteer organizations in the state
5194247 we will be seeing the republican national party putting in more
5194248 i take the fact that hes bringing in washington heavyweights to campaign for him as a sign of republicans objective to take this seat away
5194249 we had an 18 hour downtown we wanted a 24 hour downtown
5194250 most people shop dine and spend time within 1 or 2 miles of their home and that gets intensified in an urban setting where they do it within a couple blocks
5194251 mill avenue is the next spot to be in town
5194252 yeah theres lots of opportunity to look for black clouds in the economy
5194253 but if theres anyplace to look for silver linings its in tempe
5194254 the type of projects that are being opened are starting to cater to an older more mature clientele people who enjoy urbanism
5194255 tempe is vertical very walkable everything is within walking distance
5194256 with the light rail youre adding a 20 mile focal point and providing a boundary just like the lake most urban settings have either a boundary or a focal point with mill avenue youve got both
5194257 we are on a day long strike to protest against the merger
5194258 date as may be notified by the government of india in the official gazette
5194259 i will get a call a day from people who said their catalytic converter was stolen asking do you sell them
5194260 there are communities that surround phoenix that are doing nothing
5194261 its not worth it why would i jeopardize my business
5194262 ive seen transients ive seen the folks who are doing drugs try to turn around and turn a quick profit ive also seen employee theft i wouldnt say its specific to one group
5194263 sometimes they give you a cup of coffee for 55 cents instead of 2
5194264 and too even a very small action comes with a small amount of learning and that helps inform people about the way their lifestyle and their actions are connected to the production of the services they use every day were hoping to alter peoples perceptions
5194265 the most rewarding challenge for me is using cloth grocery bags
5194266 every time i use them i have the opportunity to show someone else the ease in which they too can have a part in being green that its just not that difficult to choose cloth instead of paper plastic
5194267 here i am a lover of the earth and im wasting water like some kind of heathen
5194268 i know most people dont live in the desert but i thought we have to work on this
5194269 op de korte termijn verwachten we dat de prijzen hoog blijven ten opzichte van de historische niveaus evenwel met een hogere volatiliteit
5194270 hierin past de benoeming van een financieel directeur cfo op het niveau van het uitvoerende bestuur
5194271 in het bijzonder dient fortis gedetailleerd inzicht te geven in de samenstelling en ontwikkeling van de kredietportefeuille
5194272 it was a priority for the board to get this behind them and ensure to everyone that they take the recommendations seriously
5194273 clearly they were disturbed and embarrassed and they want to make sure as much as you can make sure that this doesnt happen again
5194274 were providing the means that if they employees have issues they can discuss them
5194275 the intent of ethnic studies is to provide an equitable educational experience for the students represented by the ethnic studies departments
5194276 to be the change they want to see in the world
5194277 if it was not for you guys i would be dead
5194278 because of this program i am going to be first person in my family to go to college
5194279 these classes have helped me realize that i can make a difference in the world i am going into education so that i can come back and help make our community a better place
5194280 there could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely
5194281 the market will probably get through this hurricane news pretty quickly
5194282 our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions rising input prices skills shortages and the further devaluation of the u s dollar
5194283 strong global demand for resources continues to provide cost challenges for the whole industry this is mainly due to rising prices for inputs such as diesel steel making coke and explosives and shortages of skilled labour
5194284 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
5194285 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
5194286 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
5194287 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
5194288 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
5194289 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
5194290 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
5194291 come on in i only have 5 minutes instead of the scheduled hour before i have to leave
5194292 its the start of a change in tactics in dealing with crowd control and dispersing violent demonstrations and violent instances
5194293 it protects the protestors because it doesnt require us to use tear gas and rubber bullets
5194294 they use all kinds of violence against us but we have to get our land back we are willing to sacrifice ourselves
5194295 anyone who wants to can live in this country the problem for us is that they took our land
5194296 its not a chemical it is a smelling liquid it doesnt cause any harm or any physical damage whatsoever even if it gets in peoples eyes
5194297 this is the first time they use this water it is going to make everyone sick
5194298 i saw one boy who couldnt breathe and a lot of other people were throwing up
5194299 i enrolled for the distance learning course four years ago because i felt it was time for an upgrade and i wanted to improve my situation
5194300 i had some very helpful course mates my family and friends were all supportive and the usm environment was friendly for students with disabilities
5194301 we are not well educated and are very happy to see our eldest child graduate through her own efforts and determination
5194302 she had always been the most studious and ambitious of our three children
5194303 quien tenga algo que decir que lo haga ahora o que calle para siempre
5194304 que me importa a mi lo que caiga del cielo si tengo a la del rocio cerca de mi
5194305 the soul attracts that which it secretly harbors that which it loves and also that which it fears it reaches the height of its cherished aspirations it falls to the level of its unchastened desires and circumstances are the means by which the soul receives its own
5194306 men do not attract that which they want but that which they are
5194307 weve had a lot of interest in the notion of online gaming for the wii from a number of developers and publishers over the last year its great to now be able to offer our technology and expertise to the wii development community as a whole and we hope that this will promote more online development for the platform
5194308 you may be able to technically fly the distance at high altitude without arms on the jet
5194309 but theres a big difference between that and flying low as you would on a mission to avoid radar laden with arms which takes up more fuel
5194310 you would need the intelligence on targets and a rescue plan this is a very complex business and im certain the iranians are far from having that capability
5194311 iranian pilots are stepping up training and exercises for long range missions
5194312 the problem with this approach however is that the software cant react immediately it needs to measure the key press at least for a short period of time before it can make any judgment whether its a long or a short key press
5194313 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5194314 i was warned by a head teacher that deaf children have a poor memory
5194315 to say that a profoundly deaf child hears nothing is not quite true and this is of great significance to the teacher for the deaf
5194316 in this way no sound is involved and all must use their eyes to the same degree however much or little hearing they have
5194317 the more profoundly deaf a child is the more he or she will usually tend to watch and follow those with more hearing will do everything late and will not develop a real sense of rhythm
5194318 its important to place the children near the sound source
5194319 the hearing can do it better so why would i work
5194320 bobs always saying well this is putting money in the bank and at the end of the year youre going to withdraw everything
5194321 so i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank
5194322 so its sort of time to start after bob and i both have a little break itll be time to start redepositing
5194323 for reconciliation much more time was needed maybe five or six more years
5194324 now this will be even further postponed but i would like to emphasize that whatever time elapses both abkhazia and south ossetia will be an integral part of georgia
5194325 they were wanting this for what is happening right now
5194326 we in the united states are focused on swimming u s swimmers won 12 of 32 golds china just one track and field and basketball and we hardly notice that china just won five gold medals in sports like badminton shooting and womens weightlifting
5194327 i think theyve been outstanding the way theyve conducted themselves although they may be coming from a fairly low base from some of their predecessors in the way theyve gone about it
5194328 i think also off the floor seeing the guys the way they interact with the public the reporters you look at kobe bryant every photo they want taken hes been obliging i think theyve really taken on the challenge not only to resurrect the reputation of what goes on the court but what goes off the court
5194329 we dont have to celebrate individual things they act like theyve done it before which they have
5194330 i really do believe from everything i know from people i respect the people in the world thought the american teams didnt respect them didnt respect them as teams as individuals arrogant that kind of thing and that had to end
5194331 si tu remplis la t che pr sente en ob issant la droite raison avec empressement nergie bien veillance et sans y m ler aucune affaire accessoire si tu veilles ce que soit toujours conserv pur ton g nie int rieur comme sil te fallait le restituer linstant si tu rattaches cette obligation au pr cepte de ne rien attendre et de ne rien luder si tu te contentes en ta t che pr sente d agir conform ment la nature et en ce que tu dis et ce que tu fais entendre de parler selon lh ro que v rit tu vivras heureux et il ny a personne qui puisse ten emp cher
5194332 this is the best wedding i have ever been to and we havent even had the wedding yet

5194334 die entscheidung wird die bekanntheit und akzeptanz freier software f rdern
5194335 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5194336 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5194337 secara melulu demi memenuhi agenda kelompok mereka yang jelas tidak meraikan semangat permuafakatan
5194338 hanya akan mengundang bahaya terhadap kestabilan dan keharmonian masyarakat yang telah terbina selama ini
5194339 we gathered at our head office they tore down the banners at the head office this reflects the polices weaknesses cambodians are demonstrating to demand that thai troops pull out of cambodian territory but authorities cracked down on us instead police should have cooperated with workers and teachers
5194340 we plan to eliminate israel we will establish a purely palestinian state we will make the jews miserable by psychological warfare jews wont want to live among us arabs
5194341 a loathsome criminal act of murder was committed today at a site holy to both jews and arabs in hebron
5194342 right now i dont know how they can deal with this
5194343 barack obama doesnt want detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick and his legal troubles to be a distraction at the upcoming democratic national convention
5194344 the pressure on newcomers is getting ridiculous if they dont succeed right away players are immediately written off the way dennis bergkamp was at inter many years ago
5194345 io credo che da qualche parte vaghino le anime irrequiete

5194347 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the il bill it included language protecting roe v wade
5194348 said he had opposed the bill because it was poorly drafted and would have threatened the
5194349 if an abortion is performed or a natural birth occurred at any age even three months and the product of that was living outside the mother and somebody came and shot him i dont think theres any doubt that person would be prosecuted for murder

5194353 und als studentische hilfskraft vom kellnern oder einem callcenter job h tte ich ehrlich gesagt nicht berleben k nnen ich brauchte geld nicht f r luxus aber f r einen gewissen lebensstandard f r ein handy klamotten miete und strom
5194354 und ab einem bestimmten zeitpunkt h tte mir auch das milieu gefehlt
5194355 dies alles aufzuschreiben war eine chance f r mich diese aufregende zeit noch einmal zu durchleben

5194359 eine frau w rde nie auf die idee kommen 30 euro f r zehn minuten sex zu bezahlen
5194360 in den puff kamen t rken aus neuk lln vietnamesen aus hohensch nhausen es kamen typen im anzug aus zehlendorf oder charlottenburg und familienv ter in shorts und mit umh ngetasche aus prenzlauer berg
5194361 igor kam irgendwann bei einer bandenschie erei ums leben und seitdem genoss sie ihre neue freiheit und schickte flei ig ihr geld nach estland wo immer noch ihre eltern und ihre vierj hrige tochter lebten
5194362 ich denke probleme wie zwangsprostitution muss man an der wurzel bek mpfen eine frau die in ihrer heimat die m glichkeit hat ihre familie zu ern hren und sich zu entwickeln wird nicht auf die idee kommen einem dubiosen typen 5000 euro zu geben nur damit der sie nach deutschland oder westeuropa schleust wo sie ausgenutzt wird
5194363 wenn ein mann keine partnerin hat oder es in der ehe oder beziehung nicht mehr l uft dann ist es doch einfacher in ein bordell zu gehen als in der disco frauen getr nke auszugeben es l uft doch sowieso aufs gleiche hinaus
5194364 w hrend meiner rotlicht karriere habe ich mir oft vorgenommen mit dem anschaffen aufzuh ren die realit t sah freilich anders aus
5194365 ungesch tzter verkehr kam f r mich nie in frage
5194366 ich trug 2000 euro bei mir doch es war dreckiges geld ich hatte das gef hl das an den scheinen unschuldiges blut klebte
5194367 ich bin nie auf den strich gegangen das h tte ich mich gar nicht getraut
5194368 in den meisten puffs arbeiten die frauen in unterw sche wobei dies kein muss ist dazu tragen die meisten hohe schuhe spitzenunterw sche oder korsagen meist in schwarz oder rot ich wei nicht ob dies nur bl de konvention ist so wie handwerker eben blau tragen oder ob es sich einfach im laufe der evolution herauskristallisiert hat dass m nner auf so etwas am meisten abfahren
5194369 ich gehe nie aus dem haus wenn ober und unterteil nicht zusammenpassen
5194370 viele menschen haben zwar keine vorurteile gegen ber prostituierten aber nur solange es um leute geht mit denen sie pers nlich nichts zu tun haben
5194371 diese frage haben mir ausgerechnet jene m nner oft gestellt die meine dienste in anspruch nahmen
5194372 aber das kann man nie wissen wenn ich in 30 jahren pleite dastehe dann werde ich es sicher wieder tun denn man ist ja nie zu alt daf r es gibt ja frauen die auch noch mit 60 anschaffen gehen

5194384 courts are having to delay adoption hearings and personal injury claims to deal with a surge in mortgage repossessions
5194385 we feel the same things at the same time we start singing the same lines from the same songs at exactly the same time without any prompting and we always know what each other is feeling and going to say or do next when i was 11 i fell through a window and badly cut my arm
5194386 at exactly that point even though we werent together sophie started to feel really unwell
5194387 it is weird but i guess we are used to it so dont notice it as much as everyone else
5194388 we didnt do any of that swapping boyfriends or playing tricks on restaurant customers thing we never thought we would get away with it
5194389 even though weve only played four gigs with the band we are starting to get noticed
5194390 we are still trying to find our sound and are quite experimental but we both seem to know exactly which harmony to sing at which point even though it may be the first time weve sung a particular track
5194391 if this was 5 or 6 years ago i would have no hesitation at all i would just throw the damn thing run away and get a good laugh out of it
5194392 breakfast 3 fried egg sandwiches 2 cups coffee 5 egg omlette bowl of grits 3 pieces of french toast 3 chocolate chip pancakes
5194393 i feel like i have so many middle aged women who look up to me i want them to feel proud and feel like they can do what they set out to do
5194394 yes maam puce is a very flattering color i agree not everyone can wear that color
5194395 is everyone legal age did everyone consent okay fine who cares
5194396 dont worry about it sweetie meet tom his is bigger
5194397 hey things are not working i need to talk to my spouse maybe we need some help
5194398 college is fabulous as an intermediate step between the dependence of childhood and the independence of adulthood
5194399 every moment that i have had so far in and out of the pool will be with me forever
5194400 laura and i are proud of you our family is proud of you but most importantly america is proud of you were excited for you you handled yourself with humility give your mom a big hug for me 41 and i were honored to get a picture with her the number 41 refers to bushs father george h w bush the 41st president
5194401 i was choked with emotions during this portion especially in the jogi mahi track but held it back
5194402 i think the beauty of bb was its ultimate argument that love lost is love lost beyond orientations and preferences
5194403 then i made soup out of her brains it tasted pretty good
5194404 i have to check on the form before the qualifiers but experimenting is finished
5194405 i think they know me about my style the movement around the pitch they know and its better now
5194406 the first and second games were different teams and it was hard enough
5194407 my instinct would be for john terry because he is the type of naturally courageous player who leads his team mates by example
5194408 but rio ferdinand so much more mature than five years ago would be a clever choice for another reason
5194409 you feel terry will give 100 per cent whatever the game whatever the weather whatever the circumstances
5194410 but ferdinand might find an extra 10 per cent in his game by being captain i have noticed with ferdinand the bigger the stage the better he plays he was outstanding in two world cups but lost concentration in lesser games
5194411 this is great for kenya i know there are many more medals coming
5194412 we will just have to share the duties but no matter who is playing i want to see a fast paced game
5194413 a game at this time of the season is always difficult but we have to try to get quickly into the season and the new competition
5194414 the defeat to spain is an incentive to work on a few things in the next two years and also to develop and improve some aspects so that we qualify for the world cup in south africa
5194415 the president will address the nation at 1 pm 0700 gmt
5194416 fly into exile in saudi arabia where he is to remain for the next three months
5194417 come up with concrete firm and decisive action to defend the peace loving people of the southern region of mindanao
5194418 we will not tolerate and will crush any attempt to disturb peace and development in mindanao
5194419 the armed forces of the philippines shall not allow this to go on
5194420 we are now taking military action to stop these atrocities
5194421 i heard the passengers left behind pleading for their lives and then i heard the guerrillas fire at them all
5194422 i did not hear any more voices after the burst of gunfire
5194423 their motive was simply to sow terror and to loot
5194424 because it is his kicking leg it could take about 40 days to recover
5194425 we saw the pain but liu was determined to run liu would not withdraw unless the pain was intolerable or there was no way out
5194426 we didnt realize it was so serious we couldnt tell the people because no one knew he couldnt compete today
5194427 as far as i know everyone expected him to do well his psychological quality is great he can withstand pressure like nobody else
5194428 i ran a smart and easy race i am ready i finally got to experience the games

5194431 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5194432 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5194433 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5194434 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5194435 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5194436 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5194437 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5194438 if you take out the achievements of michael phelps the uk has the same number of golds as the usa indeed if michael phelps was a country he would be fifth in the medals table
5194439 roadblocks will occasionally be set up at on and off ramps where police will be able to check users status should a user avoid using an etag or claim ignorance the sensors and cameras installed in the gantries will be able to read and recognise individual number plates as a back up method of identification

5194450 sentiment towards european growth has been steadily deteriorating putting downward pressure on the euro

5194460 many of the items that are the subject of our appeal including alternatives the closure of lompoc oil and gas plant and issues of financial viability are likely to be discussed
5194461 this funding is the last piece needed to buy the building and then were ready to go everything else is in place
5194462 weve been told that theyre waiting for state budget to come through its out of our hands
5194463 the commission recommends that alternative sources of funding be secured for this project
5194464 we believe more than a few people have looked at this and said this looks like a real stinker
5194465 generally the ctc doesnt take away funding when a project gets to the final step
5194466 you have to see the new batman movie when it comes in the theatre
5194467 the lines here were insane there were people waiting to buy tickets dressed up as the joker and batman
5194468 as ledger described the character not knowing what it would cost him
5194469 a paean of praise to the fortitude and moral courage that has been shown by george w bush in this time of terror and war
5194470 the difference between batman and the bush administration is motive batman is just trying to do the right thing period but the bush administartions version of the right thing is weighed down by ornaments of self interest corporate interest and shady dealings the difference between batman and george w bush is that one is the dark knight and the other is the greedy king
5194471 weighs in strongly on the side of the bush administration

5194479 when the world is moving on apace a puritanical reliance on traditional institutions alone is frankly difficult when those very institutions are under pressure
5194480 the huge programme of regeneration new homes schools and health centres as an opportunity to renew both civic fabric and civic pride
5194481 theres continual pressure on consolidation in this industry but theres more pressure to stay on the cutting edge
5194482 what he offers us is a bigger platform for business all 40 l amp a offices have local ownership by the individuals in it so you dont see that corporate structure
5194483 we control our decisions so that was attractive to us
5194484 we are going to add credibility for national tenants we work with and theres a lot more networking opportunities
5194485 certainly we can offer a bigger product array than what we had before
5194486 if a client needs to make an investment we have the ability to call 30 other offices and see what theyve got
5194487 from a retailers perspective with of the cost of housing and the price of gas and relying on employees coming in who are living in buellton or santa maria companies arent expanding
5194488 the price of development in san luis obispo and santa barbara is high and unless you can get enough units which means you have to go up that makes it prohibitive
5194489 although public service can be a noble profession and i believe it is our responsibility to vote i dont have much faith in government solutions given the track record its why i am a pastor not a politician none of my values have changed from four years ago but my agenda has definitely expanded

5194508 the criminals who wreaked such astounding horrors on innocent civilian populations were not acting as soldiers drunk with the fury of battle nor as patriotic fanatics but as chosen instruments of a satanic religion to the service of which they had been dedicated by the systematic teaching and practice of unnatural vice
5194509 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed
5194510 open unto us where are the men that came to your house
5194511 had been a male prostitute in vienna at the time of his sojourn there from 1907 to 1912 and that he practiced the same calling in munich from 1912 to 1914
5194512 chose to live in a vienna flophouse known to be inhabited by many homosexuals
5194513 were also to some extent helpful in gaining big money support from ernst ro e hms circle of wealthy gay friends
5194514 reports that he has met two boys who claimed that they were hitlers homosexual partners but their testimony can hardly be taken at face value more condemning
5194515 would be the remarks dropped by albert foerster the danzig gauleiter in conversation with rauschning even here however the remarks deal only with hitlers impotence as far as heterosexual relationships go without actually implying that he indulges in homosexuality it is probably true that hitler calls foerster bubi which is a common nickname employed by homosexuals in addressing their partners this alone is not adequate proof that he has actually indulged in homosexual practices with foerster who is known to be a homosexual
5194516 even today hitler derives sexual pleasure from looking at mens bodies and associating with homosexuals
5194517 was originally a school teacher but was dismissed by the nuremberg school authorities following numerous charges of pederasty brought against him
5194518 hitlers homophobia did not surface until 1933 1934 when gays had come to affect adversely his new order designs out of which grew the simple solution of murdering them en masse
5194519 a male who indulges in criminally indecent activity with another male or who allows himself to participate in such activity will be punished with imprisonment
5194520 had defended the weimar republic and who had tried to forestall the nazi threat
5194521 employed the charge of homosexuality primarily as a means to eliminate political opponents both inside his party and out
5194522 although he was well known as a gay activist adolf brand was not arrested by the nazis
5194523 that it could be and was applied against heterosexuals that the nazis wanted to eliminate the law was also used repeatedly against catholic clergymen
5194524 the gestapo readily had recourse to the charge of homosexuality if it was unable to find any pretext for proceeding against catholic priests or irksome critics
5194525 h omosexuals were particularly vulnerable to blackmailers known as chanteure on the homosexual scene
5194526 blackmail and the threat of public exposure resulted in frequent suicides or suicide attempts
5194527 w hen moral barriers collapsed under the impact of nazi preaching the same anti semitic movement that led to the slaughter of the jews gave scope and license to an obscene revolt against god and the moral law an open and implacable war was declared on the christian tradition which unleashed a frenzied and unavowed hatred of christ and the ten commandments
5194528 the inconsistency is not in the bible but in your life
5194529 the reason you dont like the bible you old sinner is because it knows all about you
5194530 i believe that a long step toward public morality will have been taken when sins are called by their right names
5194531 the normal way to get rid of drunkards is to quit raising drunkards to put the business that makes drunkards out of business

5194533 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth game next week anderson is due back from the olympics by the time we play chelsea and wayne rooney will be more effective for playing 90 minutes against newcastle if we have to go with what we have we will do
5194534 we have been handicapped by the fixture list but there are 37 games to go so we have plenty of time

5194539 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov

5194543 every time he would get to bat it would just blow up but it hasnt this time

5194545 i really cant describe it i got to get a tape of this one and take it home this winter when things are not going real well i can replay this one this one would lift anybodys spirits
5194546 the ball was going pretty good here today it was a warm day the wind was blowing out the guys jumped on it
5194547 its like whatever he wants to do hes doing it right now
5194548 ive never seen anybody this hot before in my life
5194549 i couldnt even tell you hes swinging the bat so well right now its just fun being on his side watching it
5194550 id have to stop and think about if ive ever seen somebody as hot as he is right now

5194553 im a very patient person with players and im very patient with young players but we need to do something to get him on track and to help him im sure hes just despondent im sure theres no one that feels any worse than he does thats unfortunate im just glad the team did what they did to pick him up because something like this could be really difficult to bounce back from
5194554 i was just kind of rushing and trying to do too much rather than just keeping it simple and making that one pitch that could have got me out of the inning
5194555 its not easy here there have been a lot of great pitchers that have failed numerous times and been able to rebound and figure it out the trick is just finding something every day that is going to get you in the zone and make you consistent thats just something i have to keep working at and discover
5194556 hes going to go through ups and downs i think the key for him is to throw strikes and not be afraid of the strike zone hes got good enough stuff hes just got to believe in it
5194557 the club does have some flexibility in that it is not technically a contest
5194558 its more of a situation where we are awarding a door prize to an individual that happens to be walking in at the right time

5194574 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5194575 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5194576 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks
5194577 what ive said is that we are always looking at the extent of competition within the mortgage market and if the banks dont move ive said the treasury are examining a range of options and all options are on the table

5194708 the militants believe that the shia officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the americans
5194709 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking import of goods from iran
5194710 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shia especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods

5194712 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council siic and the dawa party
5194713 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
5194714 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
5194715 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
5194716 the iraqi government gives 5 million dollars per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province

5194750 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5194751 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years

5194765 magnets prevented the accelerator from going 100 percent wide open

5194768 he runs better on this track than anywhere and its probably out of my limit
5194769 hed go down there and this is nothing against him or anybody but theres probably going to be some nice horses in there and hes going to be a longshot
5194770 someone might come up and want to give me a couple hundred thousand bucks
5194771 went for the lead a little earlier than i would have liked but gave it his all down the stretch
5194772 hes like a poor man going to work he shows up no matter what whether hes sick or got a sore foot fortunately hes one of the soundest horses i ever had
5194773 ive got be up early tomorrow to work and so does jennifer

5194776 she was way out in front she was gone the whole time
5194777 ive been in the triathlon community a long time but this is always my favorite day
5194778 i find a lot of inspiration here especially when you see people of all shapes and sizes and walks of life giving it their all
5194779 you can see people come across that finish line who must be thinking wow i really did this amazing thing for a lot of people this is a really big change of lifestyle it represents waking up one morning and thinking im going to do something good for me im going to set a goal and achieve it its pretty neat to be part of it i want to win this thing one day
5194780 riding my bike i only said on your left twice
5194781 i think i heard it about a thousand times as people passed me but at least i got to say it twice and hey i didnt crash
5194782 after winning silver in athens i really thought i wonder what i could really do if i worked really hard for four more years and now i know
5194783 mary and i have a friendship that has grown out of a common respect for what we do out on the water
5194784 its like were connected like sisters theres this quiet confidence that we have with one another i trust mary completely and thats a cool thing to have going into an olympic finals
5194785 it means the world for me to start and end with mary
5194786 i love her with all my heart she just knows how to inspire the best and she is the best coxswain in the world hands down
5194787 and i rely on her to lay down that rhythm shes the engine determination never giving up just driving to the line thats what anna does
5194788 we even had uniforms like theirs made and wore them all the time at practice and when we came here we were on a mission we knew we could produce a gold medal winning race just like they did and we just decided we were going to do that today
5194789 they were rowing at a time when it still wasnt pc for women to be doing sports it was still pretty early
5194790 and they were strong and they were beautiful and they won the gold theres a really strong connection with the 84 boat
5194791 we are always hunting that finish line that kind of explains anna and my career together weve been hunting this line for a long time
5194792 i patted him on the head and just said go bonner
5194793 i was really excited to get out there today im not disappointed with bronze its always good to come away with a medal
5194794 the dutch were just sitting and the australians in fifth and poles in sixth were just sitting
5194795 i said all right boys were in fourth lets go to bronze right now ready and go they responded we started getting out and it became a three way race
5194796 its almost like you go in a hole and pray to god you come out the other end
5194797 its always a risky move because if you go too far in the hole and someone else has something left it will hit you right on the back side its risky but its rewarding when it pays off
5194798 while the past six weeks have been incredibly difficult and they have been incredibly frustrating watching this entire saga play out in the public i can honestly say i am absolutely relieved now that there is clarity going forward and i now know what i am up against
5194799 while i am shocked and also saddened that it has got this far in terms of all the allegations and the charges i am more determined than ever to fight to clear my name
5194800 i now look forward to every chance and every possibility for all information and all of the facts to be played out in the appropriate forum
5194801 there are two sides to every story and i guarantee that both will come out in the end
5194802 were getting a pretty good taste of what its like to be at the bottom
5194803 when i was thinking about it i was getting ahead of myself
5194804 well thats just because you havent shaved her head yet
5194805 apparently if i shave it itll all come in one length
5194806 you got to take care of this to move on
5194807 you cant look at this game and think we played well and were going to move on its about what we do in two days
5194808 they hit a lot of threes and love to drive and kick out for the open shot
5194809 the front headlock wasnt working i was like shoot just shoot shoot now thats what i did and it worked out for me
5194810 of course when youre training your whole life to get to the olympics you train for gold
5194811 but honestly a silver around my neck three times at the olympics means more to me than anything
5194812 an olympic medal is an olympic medal now i have the full collection
5194813 i am not as excited as i was when i won the mens team gold medal because we finally released the pressure that had built up for so many years
5194814 to make it here and make a mistake is hard but she did a great job no matter what shes one of the most respected gymnasts out there
5194815 i did watch her even though im not supposed to
5194816 i cant help it shes a great diver i started this sport because i love to watch it i knew especially after my fourth dive i wasnt going to be in the medals so i tried to enjoy what i could
5194817 i dont want to think about that one dive ruining my whole trip here
5194818 its been awesome i love the olympics its just been a great experience all the people the venues it makes you want to train that much harder to make it back here in four years
5194819 a new china day was born its not just a daily record high but chinas total of golds surpasses sydney and athens
5194820 because when i go to the court and the other players know i beat 19 players in a row and nobody can beat me it is good for me
5194821 i dont play against rafael nadal or roger federer or any top top players
5194822 i dont know what will happen when i play against them but it will be a good test for me
5194823 para mim este ano est sendo mais positivo que os anos passados estou atingindo mais crian as e isso muito importante
5194824 i think this to be very true in some sense do you think that people really want to leave if they are coming home to a place that embraces who they are
5194825 gwad this place loves me i really need to leave
5194826 its great to win the awgie for that particular episode of chandon pictures that was a really personal episode and i buried a little message in there for my twin boys should anything awful happen to me before they get old enough to know how much i love them russell smyth and alex weinress who i develop my scripts with are also thrilled with the award and should take a big bow for their huge contribution says carlton and over and above the excitement of winning the best part of an award like this is the knowledge that youll never have to listen to or take notes off anyone ever again because i clearly know what im doing thats a real relief

5194829 its true then dumbledore really did all that ron and hermione have been spying on you all these years theyve just been pretending to be your friend for money and privileges making sure you did dumbledores weird tests and him trying to get you to kill you know who while you were too young to survive ginny and the love potions stealing from your vaults its all all true
5194830 yea i overheard them discussing it and then i spied back a bit no doubt at all mate i verified everything the money various privileges i found out dean here was supposed to be prefect last year until the headmaster overturned the decision and gave it to ron as extra payment because of the bad press that summer
5194831 i always thought that was odd ron doesnt have the grades like other prefects nor the right temperament hes pretty volatile and lazy about the responsibility doesnt look after the firsties at all even malfoy does a better job watching over the slytherin firsties than ron does ours it makes sense it should have been dean here youre a much better match up with the prefects in the other houses
5194832 ive noticed that most of the other prefects get along with the other houses like you do and you have much more respect in and out of gryffindor rons pretty much a bigot he sees only the stereotyped house label and likes to pick on the younger kids
5194833 everyone knows rons a git weve all only put up with it cuz of harry here and his being harrys friend come on guys you havent figured it out yet
5194834 ron isnt under harrys protection any longer hes on his own we dont have to be nice anymore or put up with his crap nor hermiones they no longer have a wealthy well connected patron house to hide behind even dumbledore will drop him now that hes of no use to him ron cant influence or spy on harry if hes not his friend and has no excuse to be around
5194835 ohhhh this is going to be bloody brilliant the first time he tries to pull something
5194836 you just know hes thick enough to forget in the moment
5194837 we didnt think youd believe us ron kept saying you wouldnt believe anyone over him your best mate he was very careful to never do it around you or when you might walk in and catch him dont worry about it mate its all over now old news and its really the least of my concerns
5194838 get away from him how dare you what kind of gryffindors are you
5194839 im sorry about them harry i never knew i never heard anything i should have said that earlier i just got caught up thinking about not having to put up with ron
5194840 hermiones always talking about dumbledore and all but other than that i never caught anything to make me think they were well doing what they were doing if i had i would have told you truly this is much bigger than ron trying to use your rank and we wouldnt have let it go thanks for what you said in the letter about me being a real friend to you
5194841 are you really going to talk to him make a deal after everything hes done
5194842 yes i know it sounds crazy but i meant what i said in that letter this isnt my fight no matter how much others try to make it that way my parents chose to fight i didnt and i refuse to inherit their choice out of some bizarre desire for revenge or twisted loyalty when people choose to put themselves in a war as combatants they and their families have to be aware that they could be killed or injured thats how wars are its ridiculous to pretend otherwise
5194843 it wasnt personal you know he didnt attack that night because he didnt like them as people it was a strategic military decision it was a different situation than yours nev he didnt torture them he just killed them quickly because they were blocking the way he even told my mother to step aside and she could live i want to move on and stop being defined by that moment in time to do that i need to stop hating and letting that hate control my life i need to see that night for what it was to both sides its the only way i can look at things and stay sane
5194844 i think of it as my parents being soldiers whose base camp was attacked by the enemy who was trying to destroy a perceived threat their side won but they died in the battle thats the bigger picture the very cold and horrible objective truth is that my parents were collateral damage thats a muggle military term but it helps to remind me that it wasnt a civilian situation with normal motivations everyone calls that time a war but they dont like to think about what that really means in war soldiers die and when that happens you dont find their families running off to find the soldier on the other side who fired that specific killing shot theyre unhappy they grieve and are angry and completely free to hate but they dont run off looking for and expecting to get personal revenge at least muggles dont i dont know the magical world seems crazy to me so maybe you all do
5194845 look guys it was their choice to join the war as soldiers the minute they joined dumbledores order but it wasnt mine ive never chosen a side i dont even really understand all the issues i only know the hyperbole spewed by dumbledore and the ministry and after all the lies ive been told i doubt thats the whole truth even i know the world isnt that black and white if dumbledore isnt pure good i doubt voldemort is pure evil whats been the worst part of all this is that every time i end up in his way other people get hurt or killed people like cedric sirius and you neville at the dom cedric is dead because dumbledores manipulations made me and ced by default targets and sirius well dumbledore destroyed him just because he may have gotten in his way think about it dumbledore was the head of the wizengamot and a member of his precious order doesnt get a trial isnt questioned with veritaserum to see how far his betrayal went if they were so certain hed betrayed them they should have wanted to know by how much it doesnt add up and never did sirius went to azkaban because dumbledore didnt want any interference with his little pawn me and my unprotected bank accounts well no more
5194846 all this began before we were even born nev this is really between a corrupt ministry dumbledore and voldemort a lot of it is personal between the last two and doesnt involve anyone else and im not going to be dragged into it as a poster boy to rally the blind masses i think all three sides are corrupt and this society has been heading for a showdown for the last fifty plus years they can have it without me its time for the adults whove been part of the problem to solve it themselves wizards live long lives with all that experience behind them theres no reason for things to be this messed up and especially for them to expect children our age to fix it they should know better
5194847 harry james potter how dare you do this without talking to us first how could you think of making a deal with that monster how could you let them print this about me for everyone to read without hearing me out first how could you betray me like this im your friend
5194848 oh you mean like how you came to me back in first year when ron and dumbledore approached you with their dirty little bargain how you didnt betray me youre first friend here the first person to speak to you nicely and that befriended you while everyone else especially ron called you a bossy nuisance know it all bitch
5194849 i gave you the exact same consideration and loyalty you have given me karma granger im sure you know the concept
5194850 i will give you three just this one single warning so pay attention
5194851 stay away from me you three we are not friends we arent even acquaintances you are dead to me i wouldnt even cross the room to spit on you if you were in flames i consider your existence on this planet a complete waste of perfectly good air do not push me or you will find that the nasty cruel tricks the marauders pulled on snape are only the tip of the iceberg of what a potter can do when hes motivated
5194852 oh and ginny come near me one more time with one of those potions in your pocket and you will spend the rest of the year lusting after crabbe and goyle they might really enjoy a little weasellette plaything
5194853 merlin some of it went into my mouth what will it do hermione stop gawking and help me
5194854 i wouldnt if i were you ron lots of witnesses and you arent sliding along on my coat tails any longer everyone knows exactly what kind of person you are now as well as how disgusting i find you and i dont think the rest of the school will be cutting you any slack youve always wanted to be famous have your name and picture in the paper have people talking about you youre about to get your wish youre going to find out exactly what its like to be famous for something youd rather not be known for although the exposure of it was out of your control at least you can comfort yourself with the thought that you are now known for something youve done that youre brothers have not
5194855 if youre smart youll go make sure your sister made it to the hospital wing and that poppy can negate the effects of that potion she was planning to use on me heres something for you to think on while youre walking i have the marauder playbook have had it for years theres a section with all the nasty things that even sirius thought were too mean or harsh for slytherins i would love the chance to see some of those in action give me the slightest excuse and youll see them too very up close and personal theyre all either extremely humiliating or horribly painful sometimes both think very carefully before you act your protection is gone and i dont only mean mine youre useless to dumbles now and he doesnt go out of his way for people in that category indeed youre actually now an embarrassment and hindrance since your presence will be a constant reminder of his manipulation of my private life
5194856 i imagine this category is a very dangerous place to be after all he shoved sirius into azkaban only because he was a potential hindrance to his plans i wonder what hell do to actuals like you three hmmmm stay away from me weasel and ill stay away from you dont ignore this warning this is the last conversation we will ever have
5194857 you can be downright scary you know please warn me if im getting close to making you that angry alright
5194858 well that was fun now where were we right i guess this might help explain some of what im trying to get across the muggles have a saying i dont know it exactly but this is close people have the government they earn the one they deserve it sounds harsh but its true if people are apathetic and sheep like they accept what theyre given and they end up with crap if they argue push and stand up for themselves theyll have something better nobody seems to hold the ministry or dumbledore accountable they just shake their heads and say isnt it terrible the wizard press is a joke when compared with the muggle versions the prophet is really just propaganda for sale to the highest bidder theyd faint at the idea of journalistic integrity or true investigative journalism that would require too much work
5194859 i refuse to die for a society that isnt even mine especially one as corrupt as this one like i wrote in the letter this isnt my war and i wont fight it for people who spit on me one day and then demand i save them the next turnabouts fair play i owe them nothing
5194860 the few people i care about well you all have legs and you can do the same as i am you can leave i highly recommend that you think about transferring to a school outside of england and stay there once you finish you can tell the others what i said but they should keep it away from the teachers and dumbledores stooges

5194890 with palestinian solidarity and human rights organisations to develop an educational campaign about the apartheid nature of the israeli state and the political and economic support of canada for these practices
5194891 call on other canadian unions to join us in lobbying against the apartheid like practices of the israeli state and call for immediate dismantling
5194892 the first union in north america to execute a boycott against south african apartheid they stopped processing mail to and from south africa
5194893 with the reinvasion of palestinian cities and the massacre at the jenin refugee camp which prompted palestinian intellectuals and academics to seriously discuss boycott and eventually to issue personal appeals ad hoc appeals calling for boycott
5194894 the appeal became internationally famous because aut the association of university teachers in britain picked it up and decided soon after to adopt the boycott against two israeli universities and distribute the pacbi appeal to all aut chapters in britain
5194895 the first appeal in modern palestinian history to win the support of the three main palestinian communities palestinians under occupation palestinian citizens of israel and the palestinian exile or refugee community as well as the support of every major political party in palestine
5194896 doesnt use the word boycott but is a very pro boycott decision that was restated and confirmed in the ucus 2008 congress
5194897 the international official efforts of bringing peace with any measure of justice to palestine had miserably failed
5194898 israel has been acting with total disregard to international law and with unprecedented impunity in the last few years that called upon palestinian civil society to issue an appeal to international civil society to act since governments are hopeless that was the main motive that the three forms of injustice had intensified not just continued the denial of refugee rights the occupation and colonisation in the 67 territories and the system of racial discrimination within israel proper they were the motivation for the bds campaign
5194899 compared with the south african anti apartheid campaign we are going much faster achieving far larger and far more significant victories in a much shorter time
5194900 we are seeing an enormous reaction around the world israeli apartheid and boycott have been put solidly on the agenda
5194901 palestine solidarity groups in particular who now after four years say that we are not sure how useful bds is or equivocate about bds do not deserve the name i am very clear about this do not deserve the name palestine solidarity group
5194902 when palestinian civil society with all its forces unites behind the bds call and any group claiming solidarity with palestinians refuses to heed this call even in any context sensitive campaign then they are not really solidarity groups
5194903 we are not asking every solidarity group to do everything in the bds call just any act of effective solidarity which supports boycott of israel or divestment from israel
5194904 there are three options for the palestinian people we surrender resist violently or resist non violently
5194905 so we are left with two choices not necessarily mutually exclusive violent or non violent resistance so those who say that civil resistance such as in bds doesnt work are they supporting armed resistance instead if so they ought to come forth and say so that they support the qassam brigades and other forms of armed palestinian resistance as the way that palestinians should go in their opinion if not and they dont support the civil resistance either then they are telling us to surrender which puts them in the camp of the enemy not friends unfortunately
5194906 indigenous activists should be our closest allies everywhere as an indigenous population who suffered ethnic cleansings we do see them as our natural allies but also every progressive social movement should see the bds movement as part of their agenda we are part of the social movement across the world struggling for peace democracy justice human rights and equality for all humans
5194907 the term slut has been made up by women in order to shame other women for indulging in something that is perfectly natural this stems from a base of jealousy and insecurity men who use the term slut or similar are afraid of their own sexuality aka the nice guys and out of jealousy use this term to shame women from sleeping with other men nice guys often refer to other men as jerks playas assholes etc but this too is part of the passive agressive jealousy and sub conscious self loathing of their fear to embrace their own nature

5194920 zc has been sending walter on secondment with various teams outside the country and he has attended some high level courses both at home and abroad over the years as we prepared him for this role he is currently a holder of an international level 3 coaching course which is the highest qualification for anyone to coach a countrys national team it is unwarranted and unfortunate for people to disown their own and all this speculation that zc are looking at employing a foreign coach is totally unfounded and baseless
5194921 a foreign coach is not going to solve whatever problems we might be experiencing and zimbabwe has had foreign coaches in the past with very limited success and not just in cricket for that matter but football for instance zc did not renew robin browns contract because the players were failing to respond and relate to him and his methods
5194922 we are putting in a culture we believe will work well for the future of zimbabwean cricket taking into account the players that we have and the 2011 world cup we should give walter all the necessary support in his new role and we at zc have all the respect for him his work ethic his credentials and how he relates to the players and the rest of the staff the zc board will ratify his appointment at its next sitting but he has already started in his new appointment as substantive national team coach
5194923 china has been the main driver for demand and while there has been a bit of a slowdown were confident that it will continue to have high demand for decades to come
5194924 its not the best goal ive scored but a very important one
5194925 i do hope to score more goals better than this
5194926 gorka is a hungry player he has given up everything to play for swansea city and when you have got people who are desperate to win games for the club thats a recipe for success
5194927 his goal is a good a goal you will see at any level

5194931 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5194932 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5194933 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5194934 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5194935 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5194936 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5194937 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5194938 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5194939 you can make these up to one week in advance

5194943 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5194944 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5194945 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5194946 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5194947 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars

5194961 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5194962 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
5194963 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits

5195002 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5195003 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5195004 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5195005 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5195006 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells

5195029 the last time we had this level of socialism being proposed and inexperience at the helm was jimmy carter
5195030 well hes promoting what i would term a government takeover of the health system
5195031 he has said he wants to mandate free college tuition for every student in america
5195032 unlike ted kennedy he meant jack kennedy of course who said dont ask what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he obama says were the wealthiest country in the world you should get this you should get that youre entitled to this youre entitled to that to me thats a move toward socialism
5195033 im familiar with what his work was here at the state capitol and to me the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior

5195041 obstacles such as insecurity and unreliable energy also impact the sector another long term threat which could seriously damage tourism has been the dramatic loss of 60 70 per cent of wild life
5195042 we buy oil in one month instalments and that means if something big enough to interrupt supply happened we would be left in a total crisis
5195043 worse off would be if the world oil prices keep rising it would probably be a shut down because of our national inability to cushion against rising prices we do not have oil reserves
5195044 it helps to have a long term relationship with suppliers we can always count on such contracts to cushion us as opposed to buying from spot markets right now we are buying from the spot market
5195045 even as living standards for ordinary kenyans fall the oil sector is enjoying windfall profits you must take the lead in ensuring that these profits will be used to find sustainable solutions oil exploration must therefore be made an even more pressing priority but diversification of energy sources has to be the longer term key
5195046 after the drilling of course theres the next issue about transporting if the oil is found in say isiolo or turkana and that will take some more time
5195047 if commercial quantities are found then we have to recover our costs before the actual sharing of the oil income becomes a reality
5195048 the ministry of energy has been very supportive and very active but then the supporting ministries do not seem to understand the importance and the urgency of the exploration
5195049 no investigation or prosecution may be commenced or proceeded with under this statute for a period of 12 months after the security council in a resolution adopted under chapter vii of the charter of the united nations has requested the court to that effect that request may be renewed by the council under the same conditions

5195057 currently we have a strong force though it is still below the required international standard of one police officer to every 500 people but we hope to achieve the required number pretty soon
5195058 we have at least 13 000 regular police officers and 6 000 local administration police personal these are paid directly by the uganda police force
5195059 we have been monitoring them and even if they change the team it wont make much of a difference its cold here but we will cope with the weather our team is good we are determined to hold onto the lead

5195064 he was the duke and he was a number one
5195065 igor is a very good player but he has gone back home to seek treatment on his knee with regards to his contract and registration we will have to take it up when he recovers and returns here
5195066 elton is a youngster aged only 19 so he hasnt been registered as yet we are keeping our options open at this stage rather than exhaust our foreign quota immediately
5195067 we still had a running contract with mcveigh but what happened is that he had a clause in his contract that stated that he has the right to decide to leave after a year so he basically exercised that option and there was nothing that we could have done about it
5195068 we already knew that he would be leaving some two weeks ago just after the completion of the cosafa senior challenge in the end we just had to issue the clearance
5195069 the whole idea of announcing the project long before things had even begun to fall in place was to cash in on kishoredas 79th birthday aug 4 the fact is nothing is ready yet it would take at least a year if not more for this ambitious project to concretise
5195070 it is a daunting task to put together a biopic on a man as colourful versatile adventurous and unpredictable as kishore kumar
5195071 im currently in new york finalising locations for the film that im going to direct for karan johar so i really dont know whats going on back home
5195072 they mustve their reason for announcing the project when they did i havent started any work on it ive just heard that im doing it
5195073 the films director shoojit sircar and i have known each other for years when i was told he was helming the project i didnt hesitate
5195074 how do i telescope a life so flush with genius do i go back and forth in time a linear narrative seems impossible but one thing i wont do is official research
5195075 i dont want to harp on well known myths about kishore kumar like his eccentricity etc id rather dwell on unknown facets of the man for this id have to meet the people who knew kishore kumar intimately
5195076 i guess id first have to know the people who knew kishore kumar before i can find out about him so yes this project will take a great amount of time and i wont be rushed
5195077 well most people who saw rang de basanti felt connecting bhagat singh to a contemporary context was something theyd have never imagined i know chronicling kishore kumars life wont be easy but who said i want to take the easy way out
5195078 ha thats a tough one we need someone who can dance sing act and look like the great man but our industry is full of surprises
5195079 please dont forget when robert downey jr was selected to play charlie chaplin in the richard attenborough biopic people thought it was the worst injustice to be done to the comic genius kishoreda is our comic genius and there must be someone equal to the task of portraying a man so versatile

5195198 all political parties all right thinking people must work together to bring the situation under control
5195199 everybody has an obligation to contribute all political parties as i said from the ramparts of the red fort this is not a partisan issue
5195200 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere
5195201 i think i put a little too much pressure on myself and i found myself trying to overthrow
5195202 i was trying to be very detailed with all of my pitches and i didnt trust my stuff
5195203 i tried really hard but i just let the situation get the best of me
5195204 ive got to put this behind me and move on to the next game
5195205 of course we were pressing because were not scoring the runs were capable of scoring
5195206 that stuff becomes contagious its frustrating but weve still got a lot of baseball to play
5195207 ive got to turn it on so i can show the young guys that its not as hard as were making it
5195208 ive been through this process forever when you have streaks like this you have to find that one at bat or two at bats in a row that gets that confidence level back up
5195209 when youve got a pitcher with a fastball like that and you give him a lead it makes it easier on him
5195210 he had the opportunity to stay aggressive because it was such a big margin
5195211 theyre letting it fly right now and were waiting to get into a certain count to take those kinds of swings
5195212 weve got a lot of young guys who are being exposed to the scouts right now theyre wondering why theyre getting the same pitches in the same counts and thats not going to change until they start making adjustments
5195213 its a growing process but weve got to continue to fight

5195235 so that we asked ombudsman gutierrez to concretize her words into action or else it is just another wasted saliva from government officials repeated over and over again

5195264 the public is hereby informed that government has decided to postpone the imposition of the 70 percent levy on alcoholic beverages
5195265 this step is a result of a request by botswana confederation of commerce industry and manpower boccim to be afforded an opportunity to make proposals on the problems of alcohol abuse in botswana
5195266 government has acceded to boccims request in view of the importance it attaches to the role of the private sector as a partner in the botswana economy
5195267 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5195269 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5195270 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5195271 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5195272 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5195283 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5195284 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5195285 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5195286 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5195287 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5195288 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5195289 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5195290 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5195291 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today
5195292 people have been given the power to create their own movies and share them and its opened the gates for other forms of media
5195293 a lot of people enjoy playing games and theyre excited by the idea of making games but they dont know how to go about it
5195294 the desire has been there for a long time but its only now the technology is making it easier to put the power into peoples hands
5195295 its empowering people it makes people feel they made something cool
5195296 what is unique is we do it in a way the casual audience can be the game designer with boom blox anyone can get in there and create
5195297 the games are so huge and expensive these days and theres only so much game you can give a consumer so it makes sense to expand it out to a huge audience of people
5195298 even if only 1 percent of players get into creating thats a ton of content you can offer that extends the life of the game
5195299 it remains to be seen if this will work there hasnt been a game that gives you this much freedom to create and share

5195337 los trabajadores de la educaci n deben recapacitar en casi todo el pa s los gremios docentes y sus seccionales est n cooptados por sectores de pensamientos extremos que no reflejan el sentir y la actitud de los miles y miles de maestros ciudadanos comunes de entre r os y la argentina los docentes no se pueden dejar arrastrar por estos sectores virulentos y antigubernamentales hacia un enfrentamiento con la sociedad
5195338 para el gobierno este conflicto ha dejado de ser un problema econ mico porque el estado ha ofrecido lo m ximo que puede y de eso no hay ninguna duda uno puede negociar salarios dentro de ciertos m rgenes y nosotros ya llevamos nuestro margen al l mite y en un momento complicado de la econom a

5195345 i dont know if im going to be alive when they stop talking about this bloke you wonder if we are going to see someone as good as this again
5195346 i just want to lay in my own bed for five minutes at least and just relax
5195347 one of the things im really looking forward to is getting back to baltimore
5195348 he would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable
5195349 i knew i had to get out on that run coming down on the last lap i had to throw in whatever i had left theres nothing like running scared i had to make sure i didnt leave anything out on that field i put every ounce of energy into this
5195350 this is a very challenging bike and i was very thankful to see the finish line
5195351 i tried to maintain the attitude that its a swim bike run race and the olympic rings come afterwards
5195352 there was a reason for that lessons were learned and it was a great motivation for coming to beijing but that has never been a sore point for me
5195353 i think everyone trained hard and wanted to be the best here this medal is silver but it feels like gold for me its in the olympics
5195354 it means a lot to me because a little portuguese country has medallists too i think its good for portugal and europe to boost some girls to the top in the olympic games for me i can put this medal on the top of other medals
5195355 i won her a few times she won me a few times in the race you need to judge everything according to specific situation
5195356 its pretty high up there on life achievements its those people who got me here they deserve it as much as me
5195357 i started my strategy by pacing myself my plan worked you have to be a smart racer at this level this course is very challenging

5195363 if he selects tom ridge hes going to inflict a mortal wound on his campaign
5195364 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5195365 one of the things that ive always said is that on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception then and you are consistent in that belief then i cant argue with you on that because that is a core issue of faith for you
5195366 what i can do is say are there ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
5195367 it sounded like everything worked the way it was supposed to and was designed to
5195368 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5195369 but how much time it will take it depends definitely on how georgians will continue to behave

5195373 before joining the business my husband and i were running pubs but pub life wasnt ideal for the children so we had the opportunity to move down here again and we took it we have been back involved in farming for two and a half years now
5195374 it happened quite quickly to begin with but it still took over a year as the stocking and forecasting at the supermarket can take time
5195375 there has been a lot of press about the food miles issue and offering companies something local so it seemed like the right time and it makes more sense to buy your eggs locally
5195376 if you watch people in the supermarket they pick things up and look at where food has come from a shopping conscience has been born with the every day shopper
5195377 we hope to encourage dairy producers nearby to look at the possibilities of rearing poultry for eggs by trying to show the positive aspect of egg farming
5195378 another thing we would like to do is to try and promote packing ourselves to other producers
5195379 the idea is that potential producers will come to the open day any new producers will have to adhere to the lion code they will sell their eggs to us and we will then pack them at the farm under our brand
5195380 we are looking for people with 2000 3000 birds that may well be too small for some of the larger packers but there could be an opportunity for them with us
5195381 we pack all the eggs ourselves at the moment but we might well need some help in the way of staff in the not too distant future adds mrs morris
5195382 we are still quite green and we have lots to achieve but we are learning fast you choose your path and hope there are not too many holes along the way

5195400 we started looking for some discount prices on the hewlett packard 4350 laser printer and there really wasnt any bargains to be had not many people selling the 4350 for discount price anywhere this epinions review of the 4350 laser printer didnt exist yet and im sure its because the owners of the 4350 were businesses usually reviews come from private owners who enjoy internet surfing and writing we bought one and its amazing we started our online search at specific review write up on the hp 4350 laser printer that site didnt sell printers but they did have some helpful links to companies that sold the 4350 laserjet we ended up finding the lowest price from one of those companies sorry cant remember the link to the site we bought it from i can tell you this though its an amazing printer period no problems yet and weve had it for 6 months now

5195409 ten years for me and six for shahram we have been very active in organizing protests in lahore rawalpindi and london for the restoration of democracy music is another way for us to reach people in order to bring about a positive social change in society
5195410 i have been playing guitar for quite a while when i teamed up with shahram a student of mine at lums it took our music to another level shahram has by far the best most trained voice i have ever heard in my life
5195411 we began to play at various locations sometimes in workers rallies for instance once we put loud speakers on a dala and went to the workers rally on may day giving them a mobile concert the workers loved our punjabi songs we played at lums for my students and we played in london recently however some media people aliya salaudin and taimur khan took an interest in our activism we invited them over and as is usual played a few songs as the evening wore on they were so excited that they immediately asked us to record the songs and produce a video although we had been playing for years this encouragement gave us just the push we needed to raise our game that extra notch so laal is very much a product of our work as grassroots political activists of the left but it got its name in connection with the recent movement for democracy in pakistan what distinguishes laal is the fact that we are interested in playing music of resistance struggle and emancipation
5195412 to raise awareness about political issues about democracy about the class divisions in our society and the need for the struggle against them it is simultaneously an expression of our feelings about our country as young people and a call to the people to struggle for their rights all our work is for the people where ever they may live it is for those people whose voices are ground down under economic oppression and political despotism

5195502 its exciting for him to get another chance and hell have learned a lot from those games he played against sri lanka so his challenge is to use that knowledge hes got from county cricket over the last two years and try and make a real impression
5195503 hes very much a viable option for selection we wouldnt have called him into the squad otherwise and it gives us options because hes another bowler who bats a bit
5195504 it might be andrew flintoff bowling the ball or kevin pietersen holding the bat but its just another game of cricket

5195556 even though it is early days one does see a positive impact of the recent fall in gold prices on demand
5195557 however once gold prices stabilise at lower levels one could see a significant increase in demand
5195558 this demand is coming not only for the festivals but also from those who held back their purchasing earlier
5195559 it is the fall below 12 000 rupees that has made gold so much more attractive
5195560 the revival in demand may not cover up the first halfs poor sales fully but the gap may be narrowed
5195561 i think the year may end up with a deficit in demand compared to last year unless prices fall below 10 000 rupees in which case there could be extraordinary buying

5195583 it was a great learning curve for me and taught me a lot of things about myself and as golfer and as a person
5195584 i got through q school at the end of 2006 and steve caddied for me at the start of 2007 that was a turning point
5195585 he basically helped me turn a corner and realise you have to set goals and figure out what you want to do
5195586 he said youve got the talent to do it youve just got to figure out whether you want to do it
5195587 it has taken a lot of hard work in the last 18 months with him today it was nice to see the hard work pay off and hopefully this is just the start of many great things to come

5195702 one method of torture often used was sleep deprivation once they wouldnt let me sleep for a whole month sometimes i was only allowed to sleep for several minutes a day at that time i could even fall asleep while standing seven or more other prisoners were sent to watch over me 24 7 even during my trips to the bathroom if i showed any sign of drowsiness they would immediately shove me in order to wake me up the long sleep deprivation is actually very inhumane form of persecution and it does damage to the human body both physically and mentally
5195703 my arms were pulled behind my back and cuffed more than 10 policemen wearing heavy leather boots kicked me at the same time when i was forced to the ground those policemen continued to shock me with electric batons electric shocks all over my body including many sensitive parts like ears palms very sensitive parts i was in extreme agony and underwent dramatic convulsions
5195704 to force feed me they chained my arms and legs and pried my teeth open with metal pliers pinched my nose and held my throat open with chopsticks and threw lumps of porridge into my mouth if i breathed i would inhale the porridge i didnt even know if it flew into my trachea or esophagus that was great pain

5195707 think about it falun gong the cultivation method could attract millions of practitioners from all walks of life from all levels of the society besides the practitioners are still holding fast to their faith even with nine years of brutal persecution theres got to be some reason i hope more people will be able to come to know the truth about falun gong and see through the ccps deceitful propaganda when all the people know about the truth of falun gong that will be the time that the ccp fears the most because it will be facing its dissolution the ccp has always relied on all kinds of lies to deceive its people pretending that its the savior of all but in fact it is the ccp that is the root of all evil in china

5195998 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties

5196015 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5196016 the difficult issue of abortion should not be decided by judicial fiat
5196017 why should the government step into this private decision between a woman hopefully a man and their doctor
5196018 youve got to abort this fetus because we said so
5196019 id love to see a point where it is irrelevant and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary
5196020 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5196021 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5196022 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5196023 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger
5196024 i think it was pretty obvious weve got a lot of work to do based on tonight in all three phases of the game
5196025 it was a good opportunity for us to go against a quality defense
5196026 i know they had some guys out but this team is a really good team and for us to come out and put a drive together to start the game was good for our confidence
5196027 i played with luke before so it was an opportunity for us to run some old plays
5196028 he and i played together in cleveland so we have a way of connecting i kind of had an idea he was going to throw it because of the way the coverage looked we just happened to make the play
5196029 then i made soup out of her brains it tasted pretty good
5196030 from day 1 he wanted to end up with phoenix
5196031 it was very important for us to put him with the team this year
5196032 hes very excited people in phoenix are going to be very happy hes going to be a very good player for several years the suns fans are getting an excellent player and should be very excited because hes playing great basketball and hes a great young man
5196033 think of all the nba players that went the opposite direction this summer
5196034 it was very important hes like a top 10 pick
5196035 when i was a kid it was my dream to play in the nba and its come true
5196036 hes lefthanded and very athletic he attacks the rim with a sort of abandon and is polished with a good feel of the game he could be erratic as a shooter but is mechanically sound and we feel we can work with him on the rest
5196037 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5196038 it was just a man to man coverage and jon put it in a perfect spot
5196039 there was a little contact jons putting it in the right places and were running our routes in the right places
5196040 if we keep getting protection like that we can do whatever we want weve passed the ball well the last two years and knew we were going to be able to throw the football but weve got to keep working on the running game to help our defense
5196041 our quarterback was touched a little bit more than were used to
5196042 we were a little bit out of sync in the passing game early

5196094 weve written to her many times and sent her videos showing how animals suffer for fur but have never received a response
5196095 apparently her beauty really is only skin deep gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she continues to flaunt fur its a terrible example to set for a young child
5196096 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart

5196102 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
5196103 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
5196104 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution

5196118 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met
5196119 shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up
5196120 you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks

5196122 theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing people are different they have different chemistry they have different lives

5196125 i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time youre either a cheater or you breakup

5196134 as we are in british council i would like to ask ms olive about britain first because i assume you are familiar with the country
5196135 well let me introduce this gentleman ah he is mr solarman
5196136 i was sitting down having a cigarette and he frank made a beeline to me
5196137 he got his security to close in so johnny couldnt get to me
5196138 so we were encircled and hes like how are you doing little lady and i said happy birthday frank and he just lunged for me
5196139 he kissed me on the lips then gave me a filterless cigarette i came off all light headed he was fabulous

5196141 portsmouth after five or ten minutes didnt think wed play like we were and we were more aggressive than last season i think they were surprised by our team
5196142 in the last game against portsmouth we had many difficulties too many today we won 4 0
5196143 the chelsea fans saw a beautiful game and three points we have to keep this going we can every game every week i dont know but well try
5196144 youre not going to break into the top four no one is this year
5196145 spurs have got a squad and cant even win at middlesbrough so you start forgetting about them
5196146 the top four are on another level weve improved the standard of the squad in the last three or four years but today you step up into a different level
5196147 any side manchester united puts out is a fantastic one
5196148 we just felt we had a bit more pace than them today and there was a really good feeling about the squad before the game
5196149 too often in the recent past we have bought players who have not been quite good enough
5196150 they have either not settled or not understood what it means to play for newcastle
5196151 unfortunately some elements acting for vested interests levelled false allegations against me and deceived people
5196152 they never realised that they could be successful against me but they never thought how detrimental it would be for the country
5196153 he feels angry at the charges against him including embezzling aid money to fight the war on terror i think he is going to go down fighting but he is going down
5196154 president musharraf is not going to saudi arabia or any other country and he will fight impeachment constitutionally
5196155 we are looking at our library to determine which potential franchise properties make the most sense for us to produce and death wish was clearly one of that jumped out
5196156 we hope to get a deal done with sylvester stallone to direct and star and like the rocky and rambo films we see this as another potential franchise for him

5196158 the employer has been put on notice step out of line again and litigation is very much on the table he said
5196159 ignorance will not be an acceptable excuse second time around
5196160 we are considering this very closely and i expect to work with mr snowden on this issue he managed the whole question about hmas sydney very well
5196161 its premature to be talking about funding at this point but what i can say is that well examine all issues around the centaur very closely and the relevant minister in this case mr snowden will be actively involved with that
5196162 its a very serious issue for households its a very serious issue for business and its a very serious issue for our national economy
5196163 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5196164 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5196165 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks
5196166 what ive said is that we are always looking at the extent of competition within the mortgage market and if the banks dont move ive said the treasury are examining a range of options and all options are on the table
5196167 there is no way in the world we can return to a situation where the federal government regulates interest rates
5196168 the big miners were playing catch up from lower commodity prices over the weekend but weve seen oil tick up on a weakening us dollar and theres a potential storm brewing over the gulf of mexico
5196169 golds recovered to back over us800 00 an ounce and people are jockeying for position along with the bhp result which is coming out as we speak
5196170 many people have been profusely benefited from the scheme o the extent that some hh even have got 183 days of work
5196171 the training provided by iwd a local ngo helped me a lot to know about the provisions of the act this accompanied by the support of people and my past experience make the programme successful in our areas the authorities both at the gp block and district levels have been quite supportive to me all through
5196172 without taking the people ward members and the officials along it would be difficult for implementation of the scheme like nregs which involves very strict norms of transparency and accountability
5196173 i am in peoples politics for last 15 years or so its not been very easy to win the confidence of people i have worked hard for people with all genuineness i have stood with the people in their bad time and helped the innocents in their need

5196177 goulds cred among scientists took a nose dive when he became famous but so did his actual science research it does appear to be a trade off
5196178 teaching evolution leads to an increase in the questioning of religious beliefs and even atheism
5196179 no it doesnt it just provides natural explanations that do not impinge ones personal religious beliefs
5196180 but francis collins is a christian and many other scientists are religious
5196181 as to taking the gloves off sorry sciencefan but that is exactly what dawkins and myers do there are a number of activists in sb including chris sort of orac palmd mark chu carroll and others who are very direct and take no bs for an answer
5196182 some religions clearly make scientific claims the earth stopped rotating for a day 3 day old corpses can come back to life bushes can talk donkeys can fly and pi is exactly 3
5196183 if someone says teaching evolution leads to an increase in the questioning of religious beliefs and even atheism a statement that is supported by a lot of evidence there are several ways to answer
5196184 orac i suspect would be more careful and recognize the straw men inherent in that quote and not be so quick to say anything like it
5196185 however you made a strawman of your own by making a invalid analogy claiming that an exact and invariant geometric ratio is somehow comparable to the imprecision of archaic units measurement based on individual physiology
5196186 christians consider the bible to be literally true and inerrent thus if it says three it means three and no more or less
5196187 we deny that it is proper to evaluate scripture according to standards of truth and error that are alien to its usage or purpose we further deny that inerrancy is negated by biblical phenomena such as a lack of modern technical precision irregularities of grammar or spelling observational descriptions of nature the reporting of falsehoods the use of hyperbole and round numbers the topical arrangement of material variant selections of material in parallel accounts or the use of free citations
5196188 i did not mean to imply that all donkeys can talk but that some can
5196189 that is irrelevant since my point was to falsify the idea of non overlapping magesteria which does not require that i prove that all religions overlap with science i only need prove that one or some do
5196190 no i didnt and based on what you just wrote i suspect that you dont know the basis for the pi 3 canard the circumference and diameter of the molten sea were given in cubits and any imprecision in the cubit is bound to be reflected in the ratio of those two dimensions
5196191 even more reason to suspect that you dont know the basis for the pi 3 canard
5196192 as i said before thats sloppy writing or a cutesy insinuation
5196193 balaams donkey talking implies that donkeys note the plural can talk either its sloppy writing or a cutesy insinuation
5196194 considering what gould actually wrote about noma that is actually completely wrong gould was well aware of the problem of overlap especially with regards to creationism and he treats it as an illegitimate crossing of the bounds of religions supposed magisteria
5196195 its not enough merely to take the gloves off you also have to know how to counter b s without making more of your own
5196196 further the statement is really more of a post hoc rationalization saying that the bible cannon be proved to be inerrant by showing errors in it
5196197 is there any point in arguing with you if you grossly mischaracterize quotes
5196198 we deny that it is proper to evaluate scripture according to standards of truth and error that are alien to its usage or purpose we further deny that inerrancy is negated by biblical phenomena such as a lack of modern technical precision irregularities of grammar or spelling observational descriptions of nature the reporting of falsehoods the use of hyperbole and round numbers the topical arrangement of material variant selections of material in parallel accounts or the use of free citations
5196199 further the statement is really more of a post hoc rationalization saying that the bible cannot be proved to be inerrant by showing errors in it
5196200 the passages from which the pi 3 canard is justified dont even say
5196201 i would say however that despite urban legends to the contrary there has not been any call from christians to legislate a biblical pi
5196202 as an aside jj could you tell me which translation refers to it as the molten sea just interested thanks
5196203 however context and mathematics make it perfectly obvious that the measurements require a pi value of 3
5196204 actually jj my post was sloppy but not for the reasons you cited
5196205 i notice too that you didnt deal with the general point i made
5196206 not much point in being an atheist if the only religions i can intellectually reject are made of straw
5196207 indeed i prefer arguments against religion that are not vulnerable to the obvious counterattacks from reasonably intelligent theists

5196218 there are besides eternal truths such as freedom justice etc that are common to all states of society but communism abolishes eternal truths it abolishes all religion and all morality instead of constituting them on a new basis it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience

5196243 they were the closest to us before the war and now they are the most frightening enemy
5196244 it feels like your own brother has cut off your head
5196245 after what happened it should be clear that they should have self determination
5196246 the reality is that for 15 years at least south ossetia and abkhazia have been independent in fact
5196247 its not true the goal of russia is peace in the caucasus
5196248 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
5196249 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
5196250 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
5196251 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
5196252 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
5196253 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
5196254 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
5196255 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
5196256 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
5196257 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
5196258 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
5196259 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
5196260 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
5196261 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
5196262 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
5196263 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
5196264 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
5196265 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
5196266 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
5196267 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
5196268 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
5196269 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered

5196283 welcome to the no fun games the dirty games the repressive olympics the one party party you could go on and on like that china has invested billions of dollars in this international set piece to show the world its back and to be reckoned with but its not going as the communist officials planned the weather has been all over the place the pro tibetan protests have kept on coming the venues arent full and the joy that was so evident on the streets of sydney eight years ago just isnt here its not that they havent tried i reckon the authorities have tried as hard as they can to make sure beijing looks and is as good as it can but i dont think the officials get it because of who and what they are unelected and unaccountable except to each other they cant be honest because they believe the public is to be feared not embraced power is vested in the few not the many friends and family come before the public it creates distrust anger and danger but these truths cant be acknowledged and must be hidden china is striving to be a harmonious society officials say it is peaceful and non threatening to the world but when does putting on your best face cross over to be just faking it is it faking it to have a little girl mime to another childs singing because the opening ceremony needs a very pretty child what about inserting computer graphics of fireworks into the live televised opening ceremony it wasnt faking it to the authorities that organised the opening ceremony it didnt matter that it wasnt real it looked better and it fooled people so great on the day the olympics began there was a carnival atmosphere outside the main olympic precinct thousands of people spontaneously flocked to the area the fences were strong and kept them out but they actually didnt want to go in they wanted to share their olympic anticipation
5196284 somehow the olympic games are not doing it for me this time around

5196342 les fonctionnaires ne doivent pas attendre que le politique comble les trous le politique doit les responsabiliser les surveiller et les secouer sans doute mais surtout leur donner confiance et cela signifie aussi les couter quand ils disent que la loi doit changer cela donnera beaucoup de travail au politique

5196350 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and has now violated the space of another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks i reiterate my call for russia to stop its bombing campaign to stop flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and to withdraw its ground forces from georgia we should continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence this is a clear violation of the sovereignty and internationally recognized borders of georgia the un must stand up for the sovereignty of its members and peace in the world
5196351 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire the russians responded by bombing a civilian airport in georgias capital tblisi and by stepping up its offensive in abkhazia this pattern of attack appears aimed not at restoring any status quo ante in south ossetia but rather toppling the democratically elected government of georgia this would be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
5196352 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
5196353 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
5196354 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors unfortunately we have seen in recent days russia demonstrate that these concerns were well founded it is clear the situation is dire i again call on the government of russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
5196355 russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia diplomats at the highest levels from the united states the european union and the united nations must become directly involved in mediating this military conflict and beginning a process to resolve the political disputes over the territories of south ossetia and abkhazia a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately

5196370 the afghans did not go to canada to kill the canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghan to please the fascist regime of america
5196371 the canadian people have to realize if their sisters their brothers and their children are being killed in afghanistan it is because of the wrong policy of the government of canada and their falling under the influence of others when they sent occupation soldiers to afghanistan
5196372 its not surprising the taliban are targeting aid workers theyre targeting their own civilians

5196451 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5196452 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5196453 this was a deliberative process and not something that was shooting from the hip obviously there was an element of whats possible here but he concluded that with fisa expiring that it was better to get a compromise than letting the law expire
5196454 i dont think there has been another instance where in meaningful numbers his supporters have opposed him like this for him to suddenly turn around and endorse this proposal is really a betrayal of what so many of his supporters believed he believed in
5196455 i will continue to support him but i was going to write him a check and i decided i would rather put that money with democrats who will uphold the constitution
5196456 while the obama campaign is keeping a poker face about the importance of some of its members using the masters tools to challenge his position it is no doubt paying attention too the fact is were all entering completely new territory here there have always been efforts to influence political candidates to take or change positions during a campaign or afterward but weve never before had a national campaign create an open platform for mobilizing supporters and then seen a salient chunk of those supporters openly use that platform to challenge the candidate on a policy position
5196457 ive run for vice president ive run for president twice i would do anything that i felt i could do to serve this country but i think its a huge presumption for me or anybody else to suggest what senator obama may decide
5196458 since we are succeeding and then i am convinced we can withdraw and withdraw with honor not according to a set timetable and im confident that is what prime minister maliki is talking about since he has told me that for the many meetings we have had
5196459 its time for john mccain to explain why he refuses to ask iraqs leaders to take responsibility for their own future and why he has completely changed his own stated position that he would leave iraq when the iraqis ask us to
5196460 mccains proposal which he calls the guaranteed access plan would be part of a market based restructuring that is in many ways more fundamental than the universal coverage proposed by obama with the goal of making the insurance marketplace more equitable and competitive mr mccain would end the longstanding exclusion from income taxes of health benefits paid by employers the 17 million nonelderly people covered by directly purchased insurance do not enjoy that advantage mccain would replace the exclusion with refundable health care tax credits of 2 500 per person and 5 000 per family in the hope of driving consumers into the individual insurance market to help push down premiums he would allow the purchase of policies across state lines the mccain campaign recognizes that in an invigorated individual market even larger numbers of chronically ill people would go without the protection afforded by group coverage high risk pools would theoretically serve to fill the gaps obamas plan differs from mr mccains in several ways in addition to requiring insurers to accept all applicants he would require that parents obtain insurance for their children to make premiums affordable he would create a medicare like government plan that would be open to all and pump up to 65 billion a year into subsidies the money would come from repealing president bushs income tax cuts for those earning more than 250 000 a year
5196461 my friend sam she came over and daddy has never met sam before
5196462 after a period of relative calm on that score it is becoming clear that his campaign is once again a swirl of competing spheres of influence clusters of friends consultants and media advisers who represent a matrix of clashing ambitions and festering feuds
5196463 mr mccain is uncomfortable firing people or banishing them entirely his orbit remains filled with people who have been demoted without being told they are being demoted
5196464 i wasnt saying anything that i hadnt said before that i didnt say a year ago or when i was a u s senator if you look at our position its been very consistent the notion that we have to get out carefully has been a consistent position
5196465 for a long time senator obama said lets get those troops out as quickly as we can regardless of whats happening on the ground senator obama i think here on iraq is trying to deal with what a former vice president might call an inconvenient truth which is that on iraq john mccain has been right and consistent and senator obama has been wrong
5196466 what the mccain campaign is trying to do is take the normal statement of anybody smart enough to be president who says he may refine tactically what you might decide to do over the course of that withdrawal and how you protect american troops and how you in fact get the iraqi army to stand up faster but it is no change whatsoever in his fundamental determination to end the war john mccain on the other hand has proven that he has been wrong about every judgment hes made about the war
5196467 the battle may not be avoidable the current gop platform is a 100 page document and all but nine pages mention bushs name virtually the entire platform will have to be rewritten to lessen the imprint of the president
5196468 ive always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability that assessment has not changed and when i go to iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground im sure ill have more information and will continue to refine my policies
5196469 were going to try this again apparently i wasnt clear enough this morning on my position with respect to the war in iraq i have said throughout this campaign that this war was ill conceived that it was a strategic blunder and that it needs to come to an end
5196470 i learned long ago when working as an organizer on the south side of chicago that when citizens join their voices together they can hold their leaders accountable im not exempt from that im certainly not perfect and expect to be held accountable too
5196471 though mr obama did not change his position in response to supporters objections the mere fact of his response as well as the choice to put it on his own site is a remarkable illustration of the power of online organizing
5196472 obama aims to clear the deck by moving rapidly to the center in those areas where he and his party are weakest namely national security and the broader cultural issues with these and most important his war losing iraq policy out of the way the election will be decided on charisma and persona in this corner the young sleek cool hip elegant challenger in the other corner the old guy
5196473 as obama assiduously obliterates all differences with mccain he remains rightly confident that bush fatigue the lousy economy and his own charisma will carry him to the white house of course once he gets there he will have to figure out what he really believes the conventional liberal populist stuff he campaigned on during the primaries or the reversals he is so artfully offering up now i have no idea do you does he
5196474 mccain is giving schmidt a battlefield promotion to commanding general at a moment when his campaign needed another dose of discipline schmidt is taking over day to day operations from campaign manager rick davis schmidt will shape the campaigns message run its political operation and oversee most every facet of the organization including the candidates schedule policy statements deployment of surrogates and coalitions
5196475 la pagina richiesta non presente nei nostri archivi probabilmente stata cancellata
5196476 you cant trust the insurance industry to fix the health care mess
5196477 mccain was down at the end of the table and we were talking to the head of the guerrilla group here at this end of the table and i dont know what attracted my attention
5196478 today i spoke by phone to president uribe i congratulate him the military and the nation of colombia it is great news now we must renew our efforts to free all of the other innocent people held hostage with regard to the three americans and ingrid betancourt they had been held many years as many as six years last night president uribe and the defense minister did brief us that the operation was going to take place today
5196479 the installation of steve schmidt who worked closely with karl rove at mr mccains headquarters represented a sharp diminishment of the responsibilities of rick davis who has been mr mccains campaign manager since the last shake up nearly a year ago
5196480 i dont think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president
5196481 i certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war he was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces as a prisoner of war and he has traveled all over the world but he hasnt held executive responsibility
5196482 im proud of my record of service and i have plenty of friends and leaders who will attest to that if thats the kind of campaign senator obama and his surrogates and supporters want to engage in i understand that but it doesnt reduce the price of gas by one penny it doesnt achieve our energy independence or make it come any closer doesnt make any american stay in their home whos at risk of losing it today and it certainly doesnt do anything to address the challenges americans have in keeping their jobs homes and supporting their families
5196483 no one should ever devalue that service especially for the sake of a political campaign and that goes for supporters on both sides
5196484 for a young man of mixed race without even a fathers steadying hand it is this essential american idea that we are not constrained by the accident of birth but can make of our lives what we will that has defined my life just as it has defined the life of so many other americans
5196485 you will not be able to publish posts to your blog until we review your site and confirm that it is not a spam blog
5196486 it appears that our anti spam filters caused some blogger accounts to be blocked from creating new posts while we are still investigating we believe this may have been caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression
5196487 apparently this campaign merely took advantage of google bloggers flawed system of finding spam blogs so it looks like what we have here is an obama dirty trick to shut down political opposition looks like obmatons arent much for that whole democracy thing eh
5196488 i suspect that it was obama supporters because i think the block was timed to affect blogs prior to the unity event so that we would not rain on the unity parade
5196489 i am proud to be in the company of more than two thousand sheriffs and deputy sheriffs im very honored and have never felt safer
5196490 i absolutely want bill clinton campaigning for me he is one of the most gifted public officials of our generation and has been one of the most successful presidents that weve had in my lifetime
5196491 nra members will get automated phone calls mail pieces and pre election editions of the groups three magazines making the case against obama more broadly the group will use an independent expenditure effort to hammer the democratic nominee via tv radio and newspaper ads in some of about 15 battleground states in the midwest and mountain west
5196492 memo to obama moving to the middle is for losers
5196493 the obama brand has always been about inspiration a new kind of politics the audacity of hope and
5196494 personally one of the things i like about barack obama as a politician is that he refuses to campaign according to anybodys playbook but his own
5196495 its fine to debate and second guess obamas strategy and message but trying to pigeon hole barack obama as a member of one democratic faction or another or praising or damning his campaign in terms of our own notions of the strengths and weaknesses of past democratic efforts really does run the risk of missing the larger point about this remarkable man
5196496 since wrapping up the nomination mr obama has taken a number of positions that have caused discomfort to some on the left these have included his solemn undertaking to protect israel in a speech to the leading pro israeli lobby the reversal of his promise to accept public funding limits for the election his waffled reaction to the supreme courts ruling on gun rights individually these topics are not of huge electoral importance but mr obama is busy signalling that he belongs in the middle of the road
5196497 i have said repeatedly that i think the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstance for the most egregious of crimes
5196498 i think that the rape of a small child six or eight years old is a heinous crime and if a state makes a decision under narrow limited well defined circumstance the death penalty is at least potentially applicable
5196499 i dont think its the kind of thing you say no to the answer to that is yes if you care about serving your country that is the kind of thing that you do
5196500 in his time on the national stage he has consistently put his party and his self interest first we have seen barack obama forced to choose between principle and the interests of himself and his party he has always chosen the latter
5196501 president clinton is obviously committed to doing whatever he can and is asked to do to ensure senator obama is the next president of the united states
5196502 we cannot afford four more years of the same it wont be good for any of us and therefore we have to be determined to chart a new course and cannot do that without electing senator obama our president
5196503 barack obama has proven from his days as an organizer to his time in the senate and his historic run for the presidency that hes leading the fight to turn around america
5196504 the endorsement is expected to help rally support in the critical swing states of ohio pennsylvania michigan wisconsin and minnesota where union voters make up between 25 and 35 percent of the total vote
5196505 barack obama has taken a stroll this week away from traditional liberal political positions his path toward the political center marked by artful leaps and turns
5196506 i have always believed that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms but i also identify with the need for crime ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense effective safety measures the supreme court has now endorsed that view todays decision reinforces that if we act responsibly we can both protect the constitutional right to bear arms and keep our communities and our children safe
5196507 to have these enormous resources just gives you so many strategic options
5196508 he is dispatching paid staff members to all states an unusual move by the standards of modern presidential campaigns where the fight is often contained to contested territories aides and advisers to mr obama said they did not believe he necessarily had a serious chance of winning in many of the traditionally republican states they said he could at least draw mr mccain into spending time and money in those places while swelling democratic enrollment and supporting other democrats on the ballot
5196509 yes we need to fight poverty yes we need to fight crime yes we need to strengthen our cities but we also need to stop seeing our cities as the problem and start seeing them as the solution because strong cities are the building blocks of strong regions and strong regions are essential for a strong america
5196510 obama has moved aggressively to shape his campaign and offered a clear road map for the kind of candidate he is likely to become in the months ahead an ambitious gamer of the electoral map a ruthless fundraiser and a scrupulous manager of his own biography in the face of persistent concerns about how he is perceived
5196511 by helping us pay off our campaign debt youre not just helping hillary elect a democratic president and grow our majority in congress youre making it possible for her to work as hard as she can on the issues we care about
5196512 i further propose we inspire the ingenuity and resolve of the american people by offering a 300 million prize for the development of a battery package that has the size capacity cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug in hybrids or electric cars
5196513 mr obama is running as a reformer who is seeking to reduce the influence of special interests but like any other politician he has powerful constituencies that help shape his views and when it comes to domestic ethanol almost all of which is made from corn he also has advisers and prominent supporters with close ties to the industry at a time when energy policy is a point of sharp contrast between the parties and their presidential candidates
5196514 mccains knowledge and ability to talk about it reemphasized that this is the guy whos ready to be commander in chief
5196515 its not an easy decision and especially because i support a robust system of public financing of elections but the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken and we face opponents whove become masters at gaming this broken system
5196516 over 70 people were inside the mine at the time of the accident all the rest have been moved out to the surface
5196517 an investigation is being carried out to find out the reasons
5196518 all across the business landscape the ability of an organization to execute its strategy is one of the most critical elements of success

5196530 i think families are off limits i would never consider making cindy mccain a campaign issue and if i saw people doing it i would speak out against it the fact that i havent seen that from john mccain is i think a deep disappointment
5196531 senator mccain agrees with senator obama that spouses should not be an issue in this campaign and he has stated that position frequently unfortunately when the democratic national committee was attacking mrs mccain senator obama was not strong enough to stand up and speak out obamas silence speaks volumes and its unfortunate that he would single out others for a standard he himself has failed to live up to
5196532 i was coming to support him and i felt like i was discriminated against by the very person who was supposed to be bringing this change who i could really relate to
5196533 this is of course not the policy of the campaign it is offensive and counter to obamas commitment to bring americans together and simply not the kind of campaign we run we sincerely apologize for the behavior of these volunteers
5196534 it would be hard to overstate the private pessimism that hillary and bill clinton feel about obamas general election prospects
5196535 if obama does offer it however she will have no choice but to take it she is all too aware that if she turned it down and he lost this fall she would be blamed even more loudly than she will be already even though in her view his downfall is foreordained and has nothing to do with her
5196536 a top democrat close to solis doyle says solis doyle would not have accepted the job if she believed senator clinton would be obamas choice for vice president
5196537 over the next four years we are going to face many difficult challenges including bringing our troops home from iraq fixing our economy and solving the climate crisis barack obama is clearly the candidate best able to solve these problems and bring change to merica
5196538 i gave an assurance that should we be elected an obama administration will make sure that we continue with the progress thats been made in iraq that we wont act precipitously
5196539 he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
5196540 how much you pay in taxes as a corporation a lot of times is going to depend on how good your lobbyist is
5196541 there are certain days when you can feel the air sucking out of washingtons giant hot air balloon and friday was one of them
5196542 what ive realized is that life doesnt count for much unless youre willing to do your small part to leave our children all of our children a better world
5196543 even if its difficult even if the work seems great even if we dont get very far in our lifetime thats our responsibility as fathers and as parents
5196544 mr obama is developing his executive skills on the fly and under intense scrutiny the evolution of his style in recent months suggests he is still finding the right formula as he confronts a challenge that he has not faced in his career managing a large organization mr obamas style so far is marked by an aversion to leaks and public drama and his selection of a small group of advisers who have exhibited discipline and loyalty in carrying out his priorities he reads widely and encourages alternative views in policy making discussions but likes to keep the process crisp he is personally even keeled but can be prickly when small things go wrong as the chief executive officer of obama for america a concern of nearly 1 000 employees and a budget of hundreds of millions of dollars mr obama is more inclined to focus on the big picture over the day to day whirl
5196545 mr mccains 1974 thesis revealed a welter of other emotions about his years as a prisoner of war including a deep anger
5196546 explain to its people young and old some basic facts of its foreign policy
5196547 explain to its people young and old some basic facts of its foreign policy
5196548 he had spent four years as the navys liaison to the senate sampling life in the worlds most exclusive club as he escorted its members on trips around the globe sitting with the sultan of oman on the floor of his desert tent or smuggling a senators private supply of scotch through saudi arabian customs
5196549 sitting down with anwar sadat or deng xiaoping and being treated as an equal that is pretty heady stuff
5196550 it had opened his eyes to a much broader world
5196551 he thrives on competition and he thrives on political combat
5196552 he saw the glamour of it i think he really got smitten with the celebrity of power
5196553 i was a real jerk when i was first in congress
5196554 i didnt know anything and i thought i knew everything
5196555 han er en rigtig god spiller forh bentlig scorer han mange m l og l rdagens arbejdsinsats er helt normal for elmander han angriber bolden og spiller p en meget intelligent facon

5196557 why do bad things happen to good people if god loves us why do these horrible things happen
5196558 sister jones is so righteous why does she have cancer
5196559 hi beth i already linked some of those very blogs to my next installment
5196560 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5196561 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5196562 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5196563 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5196564 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5196565 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5196566 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5196567 while senator clinton has made clear throughout this process that she will do whatever she can to elect a democrat to the white house she is not seeking the vice presidency and no one speaks for her but her the choice here is senator obamas and his alone
5196568 obviously senator clintons been through this when president clinton went through a very deliberative process before he selected al gore theres no decision that im going to make thats going to be more important before the november election i intend to do it right and im not going to do it in the press
5196569 senator clinton and senator obama met tonight and had a productive discussion about the important work that needs to be done to succeed in november
5196570 in an analysis of how the candidates tax proposals would affect federal revenues the brookings institution and the urban institute said mccains plans would cut receipts by 3 72 trillion from 2009 2018 compared with current tax law including added interest costs it would add 4 5 trillion to the national debt and thats before spending proposals are considered obamas plans would cut revenues by 2 73 trillion over the same period including added interest costs it would add 3 3 trillion to the national debt before spending proposals are considered
5196571 do we have to win any of those to get to 270
5196572 no do we have reason to think we can be competitive there yes do we have organizations in those states to be competitive yes this is where the primary was really helpful to us now
5196573 for four months john mccain had a clear field while barack obama and hillary clinton were at each others throats given the opportunity the arizona senator failed to define the debate in favorable terms spending much of the valuable primary months defending himself on charges that his campaign staff was top heavy with lobbyists
5196574 mccain vowed to maintain bushs tax cuts lower corporate tax rates from 35 percent to 25 percent and allow companies to expense new equipment and technology in their first year he supported keeping capital gains taxes as they are now doubling a tax exemption for children and phasing out the alternative minimum tax which he said would save some 25 million middle class families up to 2 000 in a year he said he could pay for the plan by cutting what he called wasteful government spending including ethanol and sugar subsidies and weapons systems
5196575 the general principle of raising taxes on higher income americans like myself and providing relief to those who havent benefited as much from this new global economy i think is a sound one
5196576 under senator obamas tax plan americans of every background would see their taxes rise seniors parents small business owners and just about everyone who has even a modest investment in the market
5196577 mr obama often speaks of the traditional liberal goal of trying to redistribute the tax burden to reduce economic inequality and at least in his public pronouncements has not emphasized the market friendly deficit reduction aspects of the economic approach credited to former president bill clinton in the 1990s obamas plan would raise taxes on those making more than 250 000 by allowing bushs tax cuts on top earners to expire and he has signaled that he would consider increasing the current cap on income subject to the social security payroll tax
5196578 ill make oil companies like exxon pay a tax on their windfall profits and well use the money to help families pay for their skyrocketing energy costs and other bills
5196579 if john mccains policies were implemented they would add 5 7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade that isnt fiscal conservatism thats what george bush has done over the last eight years
5196580 with gasoline running at more than four bucks a gallon many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far off plans of futurists and politicians
5196581 one nation today has plans to build almost 50 new reactors by 2020
5196582 the fact that obamas lead did not increase more significantly since clinton ended her campaign and endorsed the illinois senator is an indication that clinton supporters may need more than one speech to rally behind the partys nominee
5196583 obama and mccain are even among political independents a shift toward the presumptive republican nominee over the past month on the issues independents see mccain as more credible on fighting terrorism and are split evenly on who is the stronger leader and better on the iraq war but on other key attributes and issues including the economy obama has advantages among independents
5196584 lmost nine in 10 republicans now support mccain while not quite eight in 10 democrats said they support obama nearly a quarter of those who said they favored clinton over obama for the nomination currently prefer mccain for the general election virtually unchanged from polls taken before clinton suspended her campaign
5196585 i want everybody here to be absolutely clear senator clinton is one of the finest public servants we have in american life today she has been on the right side of just about every battle that we have fought she has in her own words shattered a glass ceiling into 18 million pieces she is worthy of our respect she is worthy of our honor and shes tough thats why this race took so long shes a fighter and we need fighters in the democratic party because weve got a lot to fight for theres a lot worth fighting for
5196586 obviously al gore is a great public servant he was a great vice president he may not want to be vice president again since hes already done that for eight years but certainly hes somebody that ill be getting advice from as we go forward and hopefully hell help me when im president
5196587 while hagel is a long shot for the job what seems to be stirring some interest in him is less a question of electoral math than of political metaphysics running with a republican would reinforce the message that obama is serious about changing the way things are done in washington and that he really does aim to move the country past the partisan battles of the last couple of decades
5196588 jim did not want to distract in any way from the very important task of gathering information about my vice presidential nominee so he has made a decision to step aside that i accept
5196589 on monday he gave a sober and substantive speech on the economy in raleigh n c before 900 invited guests on tuesday he spent an hour doing rounds with a cardiac nurse at a hospital in st louis then held a half hour press conference on wednesday he convened a roundtable discussion on credit card abuses at the illinois institute of technology before a handful of television cameras and an audience of fewer than 20 people that was the sum of his public appearances
5196590 what senator mccain has again articulated was a policy not for ending war or bringing troops home its a policy for staying in iraq
5196591 you can be so proud that from now on it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee unremarkable to think that a woman can be the president of the united states to those who are disappointed that we couldnt go all of the way especially the young people who put so much into this campaign it would break my heart if in falling short of my goal i in any way discouraged any of you from pursuing yours
5196592 together senator obama and i achieved milestones essential to our progress as a nation part of our perpetual duty to form a more perfect union but i am a woman and like millions of women i know there are still barriers and biases out there often unconscious and i want to build an america that respects and embraces the potential of every last one of us
5196593 the way to continue our fight now to accomplish the goals for which we stand is to take our energy our passion our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama the next president of the united states today as i suspend my campaign i congratulate him on the victory he has won and the extraordinary race he has run i endorse him and throw my full support behind him
5196594 i ask all of you to join me in working as hard for barack obama as you have for me i have served in the senate with him for four years i have been in this campaign with him for 16 months i have stood on the stage and gone toe to toe with him in 22 debates ive had a front row seat to his candidacy and i have seen his strength and determination his grace and his grit i want to take all our energy and all our strength and do all we can to help elect barack obama as our next president of the united states
5196595 i honor her today for the valiant and historic campaign she has run she shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere who now know that there are no limits to their dreams
5196596 hers was a campaign of destiny that fell achingly short garnering nearly 18 million votes in her quest to become the first woman to hold the presidency yet her campaign also represented a back to the future effort to restore the democratic dynasty of the 1990s that could never quite escape the past although mrs clinton proved a more agile candidate than many had expected she built a campaign that was suffused in overconfidence riven by acrimony and weighted by the emotional baggage of a marriage between former and would be presidents

5196598 a financial agreement will be signed sonny will pay the majority of the amount asked by canterbury himself and rc toulon will help him by paying a small part
5196599 received a significant compensation payout from sonny bill williams after he abandoned the club with seven games remaining of the 2008 season and with another four years to serve on his contract
5196600 we have signed a bad agreement but its always better than a good court case
5196601 im relieved for the player because he will now be able to concentrate on his rugby this situation was starting to weigh him down
5196602 hes an exceptional player with the physique of jonah lomu and the speed of bryan habana
5196603 i think the owner is happy like the other fans
5196604 portsmouth after five or 10 minutes didnt think wed play like we were and we were more aggressive than last season i think they were surprised by our team
5196605 lampard is not brazilian hes english but he touched the ball very well it was his style
5196606 the same with ballack we have a style its impossible to say to deco to foul people thats not his style
5196607 i only give the players the freedom to play and allow them to express their style
5196608 manchester united will not be scared they are not our opponents next week maybe wigan will be
5196609 where do you get good loans id like to try but its not easy
5196610 youre not going to break into the top four no one is this year
5196611 the top four are on another level weve improved the standard of the squad in the last three or four years but today you step up into a different level
5196612 im happy where i am its not a case of the grass being greener
5196613 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5196614 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5196615 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5196616 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5196617 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5196618 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5196619 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about
5196620 mccain says heres my plan im going to drill here drill now which is something he only came up with two months ago when he started looking at polling
5196621 the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team
5196622 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5196623 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5196624 the good news is obviously no state is better prepared or organized to deal with whatever comes this way than the state of florida
5196625 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5196626 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth game next week anderson is due back from the olympics by the time we play chelsea and wayne rooney will be more effective for playing 90 minutes against newcastle if we have to go with what we have we will do
5196627 we have been handicapped by the fixture list but there are 37 games to go so we have plenty of time
5196628 i did not expect to lose a goal at a set piece to a header from a guy who is 5ft 8in
5196629 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5196630 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
5196631 whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5196632 theres a lot of anger circulating among the community at the moment a lot of passionate anger

5196648 it was amazing to win that much the best and worst time of my life in equal measure the most frightening and exciting
5196649 we both said sport was our nemesis and then we get it first question
5196650 its really weird when youre sat there in the studio
5196651 i rang him straight away after the recording to tell him we had won 50 000 he couldnt believe it
5196652 it means so much because all our money for mood swings comes from our own fundraising efforts
5196653 thats why i was so desperate to go on millionaire
5196654 its such a unique charity and we will spend every last penny on things that really matter
5196655 the girls did good im proud of them and the money is absolutely unbelievable
5196656 it was nerve wracking on the end of that phone
5196657 well never raise enough to do all the things we want to do but 25 000 will mean that people in sometimes desperate need will get the help and support they require
5196658 anything that can help towards finding a cure for cancer can only be good
5196659 wordsworths line earth has not anything to show more fair was inspired by a view from which bridge
5196660 after we filmed the show i was down in london and drove over westminster bridge twice
5196661 i rang my dad and said youll never guess where i am looking at the view ill never forget it now
5196662 its also about giving your charity the publicity and raising its profile
5196663 had the aussie remained around 98 cents the national average price would have fallen by a further 14 cents to around 1 35 a litre
5196664 motorists have every right to ask where did the extra few cents go
5196665 its not as if its a theory this has actually been operating in the state of western australia for some time where it has brought considerable benefits to motorists in that state
5196666 we are not debating something thats some theoretical debate it has actually happened in practice
5196667 but at the moment mr xenophon appears to be wandering all over the place
5196668 the doctors told me that lauren has broken her left arm
5196669 a girl in front of her crashed on the bike and lauren couldnt avoid it
5196670 i was prepared for the heat in the run and bike but not the water which was really warm and that told the day for me
5196671 it was tough but this is the olympics and it is supposed to be tough
5196672 i think thats why the feeling of accomplishment must be so much greater for those who are on the podium today

5196677 der hsv hat einfach alles in bewegung gesetzt um mich zu holen das hat mir imponiert der klub hat perspektiven und ambitionen ich will in der champions league spielen und da haben wir richtig gute chancen es ist f r mich ein schritt nach vorne
5196678 dortmund ist besser dran als noch in der schrecklichen letzten saison es ist auch sicher mehr m glich aber der hamburger sv ist eben noch einen schritt oder vielleicht zwei schritte weiter
5196679 nein ich m chte in dortmund jedem danken der mich unterst tzt hat ich hatte mir einen freundeskreis aufgebaut mein erstes kind sollte im september in dortmund geboren werden es lief sportlich sicher nicht alles optimal aber es war ein sch nes jahr und es bleibt ein erlebnis in diesem stadion zu spielen und ich musste ja nicht weg
5196680 wer behauptet alex und ich h tten zwischenmenschliche probleme hat einen schaden klar ist dass alex nicht mein trauzeuge wird und ich nicht seiner fr her gab es in der schweiz auch sicher kleinere probleme die haben wir aber ausger umt wir verstehen uns inzwischen gut
5196681 in den letzten wochen konnte ich mich nicht hundertprozentig auf meinen job konzentrieren ich wusste einfach nicht wie es weitergeht
5196682 we apologize for the technical difficulties but catastrophes can happen to anyone
5196683 the costs are a huge burden i dont think that we would have taken any action otherwise
5196684 its our aim to offer gas at a reasonable price if we can supply gas at a lower rate by cutting out the middle man then we have done a good job we just want to be cheaper
5196685 on the one hand we have written into our statutes that we are a non profit making organization on the other we have a very lean administrative structure
5196686 we have outsourced the purchase of gas and the billing process and already agreed fixed costs there and we are also trying to keep down organizational and operational costs to as modest a level as possible
5196687 at first we want to concentrate on supplying gas to our parishes and to charitable and social organizations here in baden wuerttemberg if that works out well well be glad to welcome others from outside who increase our purchasing capacity
5196688 if you consider that everyone is always grumbling about the costs rising particularly in the hospital sector
5196689 if the church can manage to supply energy at a lower cost then it will also be possible to keep down health insurance contributions
5196690 honey now that my cancers in remission you could use a little reward for being so supportive during all that chemo

5196693 i think that there is a real concern that russia has turned the corner here and is headed back toward its past rather than toward its future and my hope is that we will see actions in the weeks and months to come that provide us some reassurance
5196694 georgia will never give up a square kilometre of its territory
5196695 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5196696 we are waiting for more support from other countries because this is not a war between russian and georgia its a war between civilization and barbarism
5196697 what he was saying to the rest of the world is that we need to accept both points of view
5196698 hes not judgmental about me or my belief he just disagrees with me
5196699 im not going to talk about conversations with the campaign
5196700 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it
5196701 at the end of the day i think the republican party will be comfortable with whatever choice john makes
5196702 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states
5196703 i think its the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5196704 i dont want to be vice president im not going to be the nominee
5196705 unless they bring some comprehensive changes in the security this deployment will not affect peoples confidence
5196706 people are afraid to leave their house after 7 p m

5196708 it is for discipline that you endure god is treating you as sons
5196709 i am just waiting to hold them in my arms and breast feed them
5196710 i dont know if i can do it to all but i will try
5196711 they are doing well but they still need a lot of care
5196712 iran is not suffering from sanctions if it can still bring things through dubai
5196713 ban or restrict imports exports or passthrough shipments for reasons of health safety environmental concerns national security or foreign affairs
5196714 neither of them wants to be too close to the u s nor too distant from iran
5196715 and a bankrupt iran is simply not in the gulfs interest
5196716 if we hadnt stepped in to create new areas of hogs fennel away from the threat of rising sea levels this beautiful moth would have struggled to survive
5196717 early signs are encouraging that the pool frogs are settling in to the current release site
5196718 however it will be several years before we can confidently assess the success of this reintroduction
5196719 the force used was a result of the young man refusing to do what the officer said to do
5196720 bobs always saying well this is putting money in the bank and at the end of the year youre going to withdraw everything
5196721 so i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we withdrew pretty much every penny in the bank
5196722 so its sort of time to start after bob and i both have a little break itll be time to start redepositing
5196723 i guess i put a lot of money in the bank over the last four years and we went through pretty much every penny
5196724 after bob and i both have a little break it will be time to start redepositing
5196725 im going to take a vacation one where i wont do anything but sit around
5196726 i want to be on my clock have some fun and be on my time
5196727 i cant wait ive had friends texting me all week saying we cant wait to have you back im just really excited to see all of them and be around my family
5196728 were not going to see him shooting for eight medals
5196729 hes going to make some changes i think it will be nothing over 200 meters i think hes just thinking 100 freestyle 100 back 100 fly and hes going to be the best in the world at all three hell probably have to train less and have more fun doing it
5196730 no one can beat him in the 100 backstroke if he puts his mind to it hes just that good you cant explain it any other way you may never see another one
5196731 well have to see how keen he is on going to sprints
5196732 there is training involved with that i think he thinks it might be a little easier than it is i think he can sprint but i think hes more suited to longer events it will be a change for him but i think a good one
5196733 the question becomes why at some stage in the game youre going to want to come to a meet like this and swim a couple of events and have more of the experience of the event one of the things he doesnt get is almost any of that
5196734 im not doing it for the money im doing it because i love what i do
5196735 if bob and i were in it for the money i think wed be in different sports its definitely not about money im having fun at what i do and i do this because i love it
5196736 some of the greatest memories you have from meets like this are ones spent with your teammates there were a lot of rookies i really didnt know as well as others its been fun getting to know those other guys playing spades with them playing risk with them just hanging around relaxing
5196737 its one of the greatest memories just getting to be a part of team usa and be a part of the olympic team thats one of the greatest memories ill have from this
5196738 i was thinking maybe well get a chance to run another play and throw one up
5196739 and i threw it away and i looked up at the clock and i realized there was no time left i was like you know thats not a very good decision joe but thats what i was thinking at the time
5196740 if i had it to do over again i wouldve stuck it in there on that play
5196741 he said to me there are five things i could do better
5196742 thats the kind of guy he is that kind of excites you as a coach
5196743 it was kind of fun out there getting into the two minute drill and getting into the flow of the game
5196744 i learned a lot of things saturday night i think it did a lot for me and hopefully ill get to learn a little bit more next time in the next game
5196745 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever

5196882 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

5196884 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
5196885 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
5196886 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
5196887 ill go forth and choose ill look at the data and ill say yes to this and yes to this and yes to this and ill paint a picture of the things that i want and ill vibrate about them because thats what im giving my attention to and the universe will respond to my vibration and then ill stand in a new place where a whole new batch of yeses are available and ill say yes to this and yes to this and yes to this

5196891 this time of year you have to run a lot more get your legs strong
5196892 i want to throw 180 innings 190 more than that you have to be ready
5196893 thats why im encouraging these young guys to stay in the program continue to run to learn how to get over this kind of threshold so when the day comes that were in the playoffs and world series theyll still be strong
5196894 right now i feel like i dont have to work in the gym just pitch and run outside

5196898 we havent been on monday night for the five years since ive been here its a big stage for us to play on and its good to see where we are against the world champions especially the starters and first teamers
5196899 they have a really good offense with eli a big back in brandon jacobs 6 4 264 and good receivers

5196932 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
5196933 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5196934 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5196935 i know a few women who have come out here to do hairdressing but they left to go back to the coast because the pay was bad and theres not much to do
5196936 i think if they improved wages for those types of jobs it might help
5196937 theres definitely a lack of beautiful women blokes are not as picky you take what you can get
5196938 there are a small number of professionals like school teachers and nurses but its more of an open set up its difficult to find a girlfriend in this town and keep her

5196943 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5196944 for a long time people were saying use debit instead of credit
5196945 there are very defined rules about how defective merchandise would get handled and you have rights you dont have with pin
5196946 if theyve had other transactions where theres been fraud in the past we will take that into consideration
5196947 we felt that to provide the proper level of service and also to secure a reasonable rate based on what were seeing going on in the state today this was the best thing to do
5196948 im hoping we can come forth with something a little better unfortunately we have some citizens who are not as well off as others and every single dollar counts
5196949 its pretty strict and hopefully gives them even more impetus to perform well
5196950 i just dont see how this is going to help our problem i have a problem with what were paying right now anyway
5196951 its going to be more out of pocket for us and no better service

5196956 we decided to test womens pumps we got five different kinds at every price point manolo blahniks nine west payless basic brands and we covered up the brand names everyone thought the nine west was the most expensive brand and when we had our lab take them apart they were the best constructed shoes

5196965 without the co op i wouldnt be able to write my music its enabled me to keep going with my music the musicians in lafayette will be very happy to have a co op
5196966 it bears underscoring that this is not a star making factory in any sense
5196967 this is about real working musicians making incremental improvements to their businesses we give them better tools and a place to work to help them do better
5196968 we would have already been in lafayette five or six years ago
5196969 but katrina knocked everything back about a year and a half we had to regroup this place was flooded
5196970 there is such a music community in lafayette i think of lafayette like i think of new orleans its got a culture and a music culture it couldnt be a better fit for us
5196971 for a town that size it has a much more lively scene than say baton rouge
5196972 its nice to see a community where theres a real scene happening and the community encourages supports and invests in it they have public performance spaces you dont really get that in alexandria they have the opposite take on it
5196973 even though they are programs around the state theres nothing like this theres networking that happens from having offices in four or five different cities

5197114 if we were to leave the ruling then yes i believe it would send a wrong signal and i think it will offer a clear fodder for those who may wish to limit media freedom
5197115 we must re emphasise however our commitment to the process so we will be lodging our appeal early this week and we will take it from there
5197116 we need to be honest about self regulation having its limitations certainly there are effective means of protecting media freedom and at the same time helping to hold media accountable and the mmp fully supports a professional and strong self regulatory system

5197136 there is only one way to read which is to browse in libraries and bookshops picking up books that attract you reading only those dropping them when they bore you skipping the parts that drag and never never reading anything because you feel you ought or because it is part of a trend or movement

5197144 sarah was a strange character to me i dont really know how i feel about her
5197145 hes left it up to us to imagine how it ends
5197146 did you make sarah unlikable on purpose as a caricature of the west or does she just seem that way by contrast to little bee
5197147 i think my ideal man would speak many languages he could speak with any person even the soldiers and if there was violence in their hearts he could change it

5197149 blame everything on the voodoo practising drug taking illegal immigrants
5197150 i think this is true and this is why we have a hard time getting to grips with her character but she is supposed to be a newly bereaved widow going through grief while trying to be solid and strong and hold it all together for her son
5197151 did you make sarah unlikable on purpose as a caricature of the west or does she just seem that way by contrast to little bee
5197152 sarah isnt unlikable she simply isnt predictable like most of us she muddles along doing her best
5197153 do you feel that she is more of a victim or a fighter
5197154 sympathised with sarah and how her early aspirations at doing something to change the world had slowly been compromised until she herself ended up in a suburban prison in my mind both little bee and sarah were prisoners of different sorts
5197155 in short this novel seems to come from and be aimed at a guardian reader type
5197156 personally would have preferred something more balanced and a little harsher in its depiction of immigrants
5197157 until she lb is happy and safe then i dont think we will be either
5197158 i wanted justice and freedom for little bee i didnt want her to be recaptured and presumably killed
5197159 i wanted sarah to actually take control of her life and actually help little bee a bit more even if she was only able to live freely in her own country
5197160 does anyone think that it was right that little bee got sent back home as she had no papers or should she have been allowed to stay as she had a sponsor and had made such an effort to learn english
5197161 i think the novel could have gone into interesting territory if it had documented sarahs fight to secure little bees citizenship through legal channels
5197162 sarah did reiterate that she wouldnt give up on bee and i wonder if the final scene could be interpreted as a precursor to that i like to think that its at least a possibility
5197163 i was just wondering is she based on someone or is she completely fictitious

5197222 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5197223 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5197224 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

5197250 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5197251 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5197252 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5197253 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5197254 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5197255 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5197256 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5197257 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5197258 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5197259 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5197260 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5197261 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5197262 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

5197265 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro

5197267 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5197268 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5197269 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5197298 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organisation like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999 mr rogozin added

5197403 it isnt mr faheys job to decide who is in the olympic program
5197404 up to now we have always had support from the ioc and in particular from the president jacques rogge
5197405 why should the uci or the sport of cycling be thrown out of the olympic games we saw wonderful road races in a wonderful setting we are watching magnificent track racing cycling brings a huge amount to the olympic games
5197406 if mr fahey wants to make statements such as that he should look a little bit further to some other sports and comment on them as well because their statistics arent different than the ucis statistics
5197407 on a personal level i would say that but on a professional level we have to work within the wada anti doping code and within normal civil laws
5197408 until such time as the wada anti doping code allows us to do that i dont think we will
5197409 i think its a very very strong message to the rest of the peloton that you dont listen to the quasi doctors who tell you this product is undetectable
5197410 what he did in the sport of basketball im trying to do in the sport of swimming
5197411 the person i love the most is sitting in the front row
5197412 there are few times where i know with every cell in my body that my next job is to sit down shut up and pay attention when it comes to sacred sexuality when it comes to tantra when it comes to understanding how to help men women and couples create the powerful vital sex life that is their birth right mukee is where that conversation starts and ends she has a depth of understanding that is ancient and wise about these matters and a way of sharing it with such compassion and joy that you will immediately feel safe in her presence she is your orgasms best friend

5197414 ante los buenos resultados de los proyectos evaluados en junio estas ayudas volver n a convocarse en el pr ximo curso con un importe total 27 000 euros
5197415 ser a muy interesante dar continuidad a los proyectos que han trabajado en la mediaci n con el fin de avanzar en la consecuci n de los objetivos planteados a medio y largo plazo
5197416 for just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function so we who are many are one body in christ and individually members one of another and since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us let each exercise them accordingly
5197417 now there are varieties of gifts but the same spirit and there are varieties of ministries and the same lord and there are varieties of effects but the same god who works all things in all persons but to each one is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good but one and the same spirit works all these things distributing to each one individually as he wills for even as the body is one and yet has many members and all the members of the body though they are many are one body so also is christ but now god has placed the members each one of them in the body just as he desired
5197418 but to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of christs gifts and he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of christ
5197419 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor free man there is neither rate nor female for you are all one in christ jesus
5197420 it was for freedom that christ set us free do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery
5197421 and god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them
5197422 god saw all that he had made and behold it was very good
5197423 zelf was ik nog studente toen ik begon met het fokken van arabische paarden met n van die veulens de merrie nesjla werd ik zowel europees als wereldkampioen
5197424 wie het dichtst aanleunt bij het ideaal wint zo simpel is het als het paard stapt of draaft moet de staart kaarsrecht de lucht inwijzen en in feite is lopen niet echt het juiste woord een arabisch volbloed zweeft eerder over het terrein de paarden worden trouwens geschminkt voor de wedstrijd
5197425 we scheren inderdaad bijna dagelijks de wenkbrauwen bij en met olie blinken we de snuit van het paard neen het paard ziet daar niet van af integendeel
5197426 de paarden worden verzorgd als koningen ze moeten er top uitzien net zoals een mooie vrouw zich opmaakt voor een missverkiezing
5197427 voor de stalknecht wordt tijdens wedstrijden zelfs een extra box gehuurd waarin die een tentje optrekt en er naast blijft overnachten we laten niks aan het toeval over
5197428 o dat doen we om de paarden er attent op te maken dat het nu moet gebeuren
5197429 voor ons is dit een schitterend tijdverdrijf wat we hier in hasselt kunnen winnen de eer om het mooiste paard te hebben daar gaat het om
5197430 i actually could not believe that these domains were not taken last year so i bought them simply because they had not been taken
5197431 i have been a web designer and webmaster for many years and i thought it very unusual to find that these names were available
5197432 i have not decided what i am going to do with these domains
5197433 i was unaware of him i hope hes a fan but i suspect maybe not
5197434 i hope he doesnt have any illegal or offensive intentions in mind im unaware of any reason to believe he does
5197435 we are considering this very closely and i expect to work with mr snowden on this issue he managed the whole question about hmas sydney very well
5197436 its premature to be talking about funding at this point but what i can say is that well examine all issues around the centaur very closely and the relevant minister in this case mr snowden will be actively involved with that

5197438 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
5197439 as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god
5197440 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened 22 professing themselves to be wise they became fools
5197441 verses 14 26 christs thus casting out the devils was really the destroying of their power the heart of every unconverted sinner is the devils palace where he dwells and where he rules there is a kind of peace in the heart of an unconverted soul while the devil as a strong man armed keeps it the sinner is secure has no doubt concerning the goodness of his state nor any dread of the judgment to come but observe the wonderful change made in conversion the conversion of a soul to god is christs victory over the devil and his power in that soul restoring the soul to its liberty and recovering his own interest in it and power over it all the endowments of mind and body are now employed for christ
5197442 i came and i spoke with you that you would believe in me because i am the light of the world to all people that sit in great darkness but you received me not
5197443 please raise your tray tables and make sure your seat belt is buckled
5197444 temperature at landing is a balmy thirty four degrees with light snow falling
5197445 we are leaving the islands tomorrow but felt compelled to thank you for providing some wonderful memories for our visit this year i hope our dog didnt bother you or your friends as you frolicked with each other on the beach in the water we didnt mean to watch but once was enough to keep us hoping for repeat performances we could see you you just couldnt see us though a couple of times i could have sworn you were looking right at me as you stared at our telescope perhaps on a future trip we might actually meet again thank you for the memories sandra and rebecca

5197460 irrigating with wastewater isnt a rare practice limited to a few of the poorest countries
5197461 its a widespread phenomenon occurring on 20 million hectares across the developing world especially in asian countries like china india and vietnam but also around nearly every city of sub saharan africa and in many latin american cities as well
5197462 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
5197463 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
5197464 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
5197465 this is the first time anyone has done really fundamental hands on quantum mechanics with an organic led this is tough stuff
5197466 we can convert the spin information into a current and manipulate it and change it
5197467 we are manipulating this information and reading it out again we are writing it and reading it
5197468 even the smallest transistor today consists of hundreds of thousands of atoms the ultimate goal of miniaturization is to implement electronics on the scale of atoms and electrons
5197469 my mom always sends a text at the right time

5197479 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5197480 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
5197481 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
5197482 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
5197483 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
5197484 i know a few women who have come out here to do hairdressing but they left to go back to the coast because the pay was bad and theres not much to do
5197485 i think if they improved wages for those types of jobs it might help
5197486 theres definitely a lack of beautiful women blokes are not as picky you take what you can get
5197487 there are a small number of professionals like school teachers and nurses but its more of an open set up its difficult to find a girlfriend in this town and keep her
5197488 they played as a team they closed the midfield they played touch football

5197503 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5197504 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5197505 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5197506 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5197507 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5197508 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5197509 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5197510 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5197511 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5197512 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5197513 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5197514 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5197515 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5197516 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5197517 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5197518 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5197519 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5197520 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5197521 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5197522 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5197523 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5197524 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5197525 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5197526 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5197527 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5197528 this is a planning took where all things are going
5197529 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5197530 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5197531 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5197532 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5197533 comme a il va tre m me si cest mieux te toute manche le gourdin de mado montrer tes yeux sont de formation
5197534 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5197535 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5197536 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5197537 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5197538 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5197539 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5197540 ok i need to loose weight and i am not
5197541 cobiella asked if this is such scoop and this was first out several ed note nine months ago why didnt others pick up on it
5197542 that is the sixty four thousand million dollar question isnt it
5197543 the national enquirer gives the story cooties for all the times and boston globes the washington posts of the world that is partly because thirty years forty fifty years ago the national enquirer was very different than today it is this low brow celebrity scandal mongering thing
5197544 stop stop i dont want to go there i do not like it
5197545 and theres some places i dont want to go and in this case we really have tried to stay away from that aspect of the story
5197546 i want to hit the news element of the story i want to hit the fact that a man running for president had an affair and then lied about it to the american public and you know darn near blew up his own political party while doing it
5197547 we have other issues and besides he denied it and we swallowed it

5197550 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5197551 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5197552 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5197553 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5197554 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5197555 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5197556 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5197557 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5197558 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5197559 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5197560 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5197561 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5197562 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5197563 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5197564 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5197565 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5197566 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5197567 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5197568 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5197569 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5197570 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5197571 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5197572 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5197573 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5197574 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5197575 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5197576 unter allen die zu uns kommen scheint die zahl der vernachl ssigungsf lle zu wachsen hier wird inzwischen nicht nur in der ffentlichkeit sondern auch in der fachwelt genauer hingeguckt
5197577 da die familienhebamme in nordrhein westfalen und niedersachsen schon erfolgreich arbeitet ist es auch f r berlin sinnvoll dieses vorhaben auszuweiten
5197578 die kinder die zu uns kommen kennen oft kein gutes wort sind m de schmutzig und riechen schlecht
5197579 viele kinder werden bei uns erstmals mit einer warmen mahlzeit von einem teller auf einem tisch konfrontiert

5197582 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5197583 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5197584 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5197585 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5197586 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5197587 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5197588 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5197589 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5197590 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5197591 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5197592 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5197593 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
5197594 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
5197595 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
5197596 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
5197597 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
5197598 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
5197599 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
5197600 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
5197601 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
5197602 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
5197603 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
5197604 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
5197605 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
5197606 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
5197607 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
5197608 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
5197609 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
5197610 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
5197611 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
5197612 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
5197613 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
5197614 ich m chte mich bei benedikt xvi f r das wichtigste anliegen bedanken das ich an ihn hatte da er das motu proprio zur wiederfreigabe der alten messe erlassen hat

5197650 it can typically take months to introduce a new mobile campaign across all the carriers
5197651 this clearly needs to change as many campaigns lose relevancy with each passing month and some campaigns are never considered because of the production time mobile service and content providers need to be able to react to the market quickly and provision new mobile campaigns in a more dynamic fashion
5197652 surprisingly none of the respondents said that they use any form of loyalty scheme as an incentive to increase content purchasing or encourage repeat buyers

5197733 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
5197734 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
5197735 ive been throwing the ball well i just feel like once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok

5197739 when you see the crowd you realize why he had to come out
5197740 his takeoff foot so there is a lot of stress on that area
5197741 in watching warmups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5197742 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5197743 and will encourage him to come back to the track

5197746 gold rebounded mainly on technical short covering it may rebound above 800 looking at the dollar and oil
5197747 gold and other metals have recovered a bit but its still early to say they will recover continuously gold and oil prices are still in a downward trend
5197748 gold and precious metals have been oversold and the pace of falls was clearly too rapid gold is gaining some support with end users also showing demand on price dips
5197749 active sell offs may slow but a rapid recovery is also not expected as there is plenty of selling interest if gold rises back to around 850

5197756 that could soon change as warners is readying to revamp how dvs properties are developed changes that could be announced within the next month
5197757 these are big iconic characters so when you make them into a movie youd better be shooting for a pretty high standard yourre not always going to reach it but you have to be shooting for it were going to make a justice league movie whether its now or 10 years from now but were not going to do it and warners is not going to do it until we know its right
5197758 im me so who are you youre not me and i know that aint fair but i dont care
5197759 i just put my i pod on shuffle and enjoy the kenyan beat before getting into competition
5197760 you get to run out there wearing the uniform of the world champions its an awesome feeling to live that out hopefully this time ill be running on the field and actually snapping the ball
5197761 you have your ups and your downs you just have to go with it and be positive about everything
5197762 ive learned a lot and im better than i was a month ago but theres still a lot more to improve on and hopefully ill get back that confidence that i had when i was at kentucky right now im kind of low with that because of not knowing the offense as well
5197763 but its hard for a guy thats not getting as many reps as the top three quarterbacks to show what he can or cant do
5197764 andre hes a rookie quarterback first time into the nfl and weve all been there and he asks some good questions which is good
5197765 if he doesnt understand something hes stepping up and asking questions which is important for a young quarterback you try to explain things so he understands it
5197766 he is like a lot of young quarterbacks he has it all upstairs as far as what the plays are but he is still working on being able to pull it out
5197767 its been a while so ill probably look a little rusty but im just excited to have this chance to showcase what i have
5197768 hopefully im in there for a while but if not then i still got a chance

5197772 we didnt have to do what we did today we were relaxed we had a bit of fun and it was all right
5197773 thats the art of it but its a bit harder to do when theres high pressure
5197774 i was looking forward to getting it over and done with getting a medal around the neck and then really relaxing
5197775 its been really stressful its a long event which im glad we got it over and done with and got a silver which looked a long long way off

5197778 a crush of photographers had to be held back as the 23 year old phelps entered the packed room a flurry of clicking shutters sounded each time he gestured
5197779 i opted for rafael sobis because of the way he has improved in training and during the games
5197780 rafael is a player who can survive tough marking who opens up spaces who can make diagonal runs and doesnt get caught offside
5197781 he gets involved in training and he is used to these types of games in the libertadores

5197793 he was very free and easy and there wasnt a lot of stress
5197794 i felt pretty good i was very consistent throwing my fastball inside and outside for strikes and they like to put the ball in play that makes your job a lot easier
5197795 you dont ever see him complaining about taking the ball he wants to be out there and wants to pitch
5197796 i dont like taking days but i think theyre necessary at the end of august when youre playing 23 or 24 straight games
5197797 im sure this will help me have the kind of stretch run that i want to have
5197798 right now i dont have the best understanding of it
5197799 this system is very detailed its difficult to pick up and theyve thrown a lot at me thats the most frustrating thing there is so much offense that you want to learn but if you dont have a great understanding or feel for it it can show in your play
5197800 he is like a lot of young quarterbacks he has it all upstairs as far as what the plays are but he is still working on being able to pull it out
5197801 im very happy with his delivery he came into camp with a little hitch in his delivery which has improved
5197802 im here to service these guys and give lawrence an opportunity to rest up and its a good opportunity for me to get out there get some game film and hope that someone sees me
5197803 then of course we all checked our cash boxes and found that there were a lot of these bills that looked different floating around
5197804 people had them posted up and everyone was so indignant like who would rip off farmers
5197805 the police came and the customers were checking their wallets too because the fives were posted up and there was an officer walking around with a hand full of them it was just hysterical to look back at
5197806 it used to be known as the parrsboro rockhound roundup and i think some people thought it was over when we started calling it the nova scotia gem and mineral show
5197807 but i guess enough people know about it from the turnout
5197808 there were a number of presentations made throughout the days and people really enjoy watching how the jewelry is made or how we can tell whether or not a gem is real
5197809 you have to wonder why people value these gems so much you cant eat them or heat the house with them
5197810 it was a steady stream of cars right about from 10 in the morning till easily after lunch and they just werent stopping
5197811 i saw a lot of good sculptures and displays being set up everything from a batman to the great wall of china right down to the crest of the green party of canada elizabeth may was there herself making it
5197812 there were some real professionals obviously some of my favourites are the little children making their real sandcastles
5197813 you know they get going on these sculptures and theyre pretty dedicated
5197814 out of the thousands of people who do attend a small portion are from the local communities and mostly theyre working on concessions and volunteering and helping with parking
5197815 so far the knee has been good so hell be evaluated monday and well make a decision
5197816 every time we got to just batting practice it seemed to blow up but it has not happened this time he seems to be healthy and hes running well so were encouraged by it
5197817 i wasnt worried about how many wins i was getting i was just trying to get a spot in the rotation and stay there thats all i was concerned about
5197818 i was hoping id be important to the club that id have a role like ive had in the past coming off last year and the way things were setting up in spring training youre not really sure the way its going to be
5197819 but weve had some injuries and the young guys struggled and got hurt so me and andy pettitte are the two old guys thatve been going out there and hopefully we can just keep going
5197820 twenty wins will come if he continues to pitch the way hes pitching
5197821 hes throwing the ball great been really consistent locates changes speeds and hes in a nice groove
5197822 those field goals are pretty high percentage field goals in the 90 percent range league wide
5197823 the 43 yarder is a lot tougher but when youre that close 23 yards those have to be like gimmes it was a missed field goal from the 5 yard line to tie the game you have to make it we have to be able to execute that play thats pretty standard operation procedure
5197824 im just hoping the opportunity comes up somewhere because im telling you right now when i do get that chance im going to be like an angry man in hell
5197825 if i get the opportunity to be able to get in there and perform on the roster as a running back im not going to give it back
5197826 monday night football is a great opportunity because everybody is going to be watching
5197827 i know its a business and it comes down to a numbers game and injuries at a certain position hopefully i get enough time to go out there and showcase what i have for the other 31 teams out there in the nfl
5197828 im not worried about my ability to play the game i feel when i do get the opportunity i might be another ryan grant story
5197829 im 29 years old but one thing about it i havent been playing football all my life so my body is not at the age of a 29 year old football player
5197830 i had to look myself in the mirror and questioned myself like man what am i doing here
5197831 it doesnt make a difference how it looks we have to get the job done and we need to win games
5197832 weve underachieved all year and we do need to have a nice streak
5197833 weve got 38 games left and weve got to win most of them
5197834 weve got to take it like its the last week of september
5197835 bannister was tough on us the first time we saw him but we got on him today
5197836 i knew i was out there for the right reasons
5197837 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way
5197838 one thing i know for sure when i stepped on the field as i did saturday i knew i made the right decision
5197839 its still a little bit awkward i dont know how else to tell you i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out
5197840 the clock is obviously against me a little bit and to a certain degree maybe the team too just because we havent worked together that long
5197841 i dont know what eric wants to do if he says hey brett ill let you play as long as you want im all for it you have to get your feet wet somehow there are certain situations that you dont get just playing the first two series of the game youd like to get a two minute drill youd like to get maybe some more red zone some more third downs
5197842 i noticed the snes inflight entertainment controllers on an overseas flight too

5197846 once you become immersed in the whole breast cancer treatment process its like every second person you talk to either has gone through it or knows someone
5197847 in nova scotia i believe women are entitled to state of the art breast care and this is a way for us to attain that
5197848 they only we will continue to make strides is through research and using that research
5197849 there were once five of these towers around the village and this is the only one left
5197850 i have meetings scheduled with architects engineers and fundraising experts to give me guidance but before we have even asked for a cent we have already received around 10 000 in donations
5197851 i used to go there every day when i was a kid so i would love for the fundraising to be big and quick so by next spring we are already physically working on it
5197852 theres not a lot of heritage left in chester and people really want to go up in the tower so we want to make that happen and we will
5197853 still i am sure that as gordon brown has vowed that he would
5197854 you wont find anything like this in the province or the maritimes for that matter
5197855 he loved people to see his things and he entertained often
5197856 now where else in nova scotia would you see that
5197857 its a challenge for us we need to play well thats the bottom line i dont know how else you can say it we need to win some games
5197858 hes always a positive guy with energy its good to see something like that hes the captain if you see him getting upset or giving in to the pressures of losing and all that it cant help but influence the other guys but he keeps it consistent and its just awesome
5197859 but from now on we need to be consistent and win some games we feel as though we have a good team here we have to prove that over these 30 something games

5197884 enough of all the curse this the curse that the goat the black cat or the 100 years
5197885 there is time but you dont want to get too far behind
5197886 at this time of the year if you get five or six games behind its not like you cant do it but youve really got to play good and the team ahead of you has got to fold or go through a bad streak
5197887 im open for suggestions ill listen to what anybodys got to say fans cab drivers
5197888 its very important that you stay upbeat and you stay cool and you stay relaxed were definitely trying if anything maybe were trying too hard the only reason i say that is because we take fastballs and we swing at balls out of the strike zone if we dont win its our fault because we are definitely capable of winning our division we definitely can control our destiny
5197889 he pitched himself right into some 2 0 3 1 counts thats not good hes a contact guy he doesnt throw in the strike zone hes not going to be out there long
5197890 we finally got him a little bit of run support
5197891 enough i guess i wouldnt say all that much run support by any means but it was good for him to get a win
5197892 its something that every one of us on the starting staff tries to do
5197893 put up good innings and quality starts and hope for the best ive been able to do that but unfortunately it hasnt been able to go my way and i think thats just baseball you cant go out there expecting to get a win every time
5197894 i went through a hurricane in fort myers when i was in class a ball in 1995 and we didnt play for a week
5197895 im scared people will be evacuating and the dumb angels are going there
5197896 there are a lot of people i still care about here in the bay area
5197897 i love coming back to stanford although i didnt have a chance to go back this trip the bay area is familiar to me and i always liked the bay area
5197898 when i get that many runs i think just throw strikes and be aggressive
5197899 everything was working with that many runs just continue to pound the strike zone
5197900 every time we come here we get some crazy games
5197901 we start out good with the uribe home run and we took advantage of the guy not throwing strikes he was all over the place and when he tried to find the plate we didnt miss them
5197902 i stay up at night thinking about how i can get our offense going and clicking again like it was
5197903 im puzzled by it im open to suggestions and ill listen to what anybody has to say fans cabdrivers or president bush or anybody
5197904 for 3 years some of the guys weve had in our lineup the big guys in our lineup theyve produced a lot of runs all of a sudden its hard for us to score runs now
5197905 it definitely means a lot just getting a win but it also means a lot just being able to finally get one in san diego
5197906 any time you come home you want to do the best you possibly can
5197907 we werent able to really go out there and succeed
5197908 i think thats more the focus its all about the team when you start focusing on your own goals youre going to get yourself in trouble the ultimate goal is to get to the playoffs and get to the world series one win doesnt really mean anything a 5 2 record would have been a lot better
5197909 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5197910 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5197911 he just made some mistakes early in the game and the guys hit him
5197912 otherwise that doesnt happen to him too often some days that happens
5197913 a spaniard just won the tour de france and rafael nadal won wimbledon
5197914 the spanish are on a roll and somebody has to stop it
5197915 hes won every race hes competed in this year except for european championships where i think the other countries ganged up on him
5197916 its a hard course i like to say it sorts the men from the boys
5197917 its got a temple in the middle of the lake and a huge dam wall right there
5197918 we just want to be able to put together a team that has the best chance of winning
5197919 thats what the canadian public has invested in with where the funding dollars go and thats the expectations of the canadian olympic committee
5197920 simon and colin jenkins are going to work as a team
5197921 if you could ghost race with yourself from eight years ago i couldnt swim bike or run with myself

5197930 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5197931 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5197932 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5197933 some of these things come back right away and theyre ready to go a lot of players play with these things
5197934 its been a long time since ive been to 16 and its still august
5197935 hopefully i can get a few more before the season is over
5197936 thats something that will come if he continues to pitch the way hes pitching
5197937 hes had a great season up until this point and as long as he stays healthy its a possibility
5197938 the bullpen has been really good behind me the guys have been scoring me runs and weve been playing solid defense all those things that work for you
5197939 sieben stunden mussten die 900 soldaten unter den lettern ausharren damit das sich nach und nach einfindende publikum nichts von der geplanten vorf hrung mitbekommen w rde
5197940 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5197941 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5197942 i feel like i gained a lot of confidence in myself again this year
5197943 being pain free in the later part of the year i started feeling confident from may on its getting better and better and now in the off season i know what to work on for next year
5197944 nothing would make me happier or prouder than to win the cn canadian open
5197945 and priddis next year in calgary that golf course sets my eye already
5197946 we win the gold medal im speechless i cant very well say its the happiest day of my life because ive got married between athens and now this is a close second
5197947 hopefully there are more to come with canoeing starting and trampoline obviously were hoping there is a good momentum for more medals
5197948 i was proud of what i was able to achieve today
5197949 im ending my career doing my personal best at the olympic games and you couldnt ask for much more than that
5197950 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
5197951 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
5197952 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point
5197953 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
5197954 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and iain said go for it we committed everything we had and went
5197955 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
5197956 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
5197957 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5197958 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5197959 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5197960 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5197961 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5197962 what were doing here is a little bit of practising for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5197963 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5197964 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5197965 we just didnt have enough for the no 99 there at the end we werent able to get through the corners as fast as carl was
5197966 last year was a bit of a difficult season where we had so many new faces on the team
5197967 weve just had more of a great team atmosphere this year
5197968 i think this teams all on the same mental page and obviously our goal is to win next weekend
5197969 as great a season as weve had it would be pretty disappointing not to win it all
5197970 to win the champions league the premier league we need more than this
5197971 i said to anelka today you have three or four chances and you have to make one or two goals for me and for the people because i want the people to believe in you
5197972 today they played very well its important but more important is that the fans of chelsea saw a beautiful game
5197973 i was getting pretty drained mentally i really wanted to get out on the court
5197974 during the wait i was frustrated but once youre on the court youre all there its all good
5197975 the first set i was coming to the net mixing serve and volley and the second set i was just staying back and being lackadaisical
5197976 i was playing his game and hes so quick around the court hes going to get everything back im probably going to get tired before he does
5197977 i didnt have any fight in me anymore i guess
5197978 i just lost my momentum i think he just kept the ball in play nice and deep and i was just giving it to him a little short i came up short
5197979 the first set i think i was pretty tight my forehand was not working very well
5197980 the second set i pulled it together and started to swing so it was a lot better
5197981 i guess i kind of tightened up in the second set
5197982 theyve had to go through the minor league stuff with me too
5197983 its everything that its wrapped up to be that you hear about
5197984 i knew i was out there for the right reasons
5197985 obviously a lot of things have gone on the last few months im not going to sit here and say i havent second guessed decisions not only this year but along the way one thing i know for sure when i step on the field as i did tonight i knew i made the right decision
5197986 first pass of the game i threw to jerricho was a second window slant
5197987 a lot of guys will not throw that ball in the second window or the receiver will give up when he runs into a defender little things like that are easily overlooked by the average fan i told jerricho dont give up second window could be third window because thats the way ive always played
5197988 what ive been telling people is while he throws the ball pretty hard he can make all the throws
5197989 he has a lot more touch than people think he can do the touch passes he can zip it in there
5197990 it is crazy i mean catching a touchdown pass from a living legend
5197991 a guy that is definitely a hall of famer its overwhelming to be honest
5197992 he did a nice job for being around for a short period of time it just shows his expertise at the quarterback position
5197993 if he mangini says hey brett ill let you play as long as you want im all for it
5197994 you have to get your feet wet somehow theres no substitute for game type situations im sure well talk about it this week but believe me from my end ready or not i need to be in there
5197995 if we dont were not going to win thats what it comes down to so yeah i think 3 4 5 in the lineup have to come up big we havent lately but today we did

5197998 if the power eliteof driven in passage to aforementioned trivial forms referring to complaining that procedure yours trulyve imminently brought about personage honorable
5197999 but the important thing is we won the game today and hope that tomorrow we can break out
5198000 i think we have our backs up against the wall
5198001 every game is very important we have six games on this road trip six or seven six every game is an important game youve got to take it like its the last week of september
5198002 its not a football season where you have 16 games and its over with we play every single day you have to find a way when things arent going your way to turn it around we play every day for a reason you cant be concerned about what happened the previous day
5198003 i dont know how many times i want to try with the motivation of giving up a couple to help us get going but it worked again
5198004 its probably the fourth time this year ive given up a couple in the first and then weve come back and swung the bats real well giambi hits a grand slam and it was just smooth baseball from that point forward
5198005 it was a fun game to watch it was fun to be in the dugout watching everybody go to the plate
5198006 olen taloudellisesti riippumaton ja velaton sek omistan arvokkaan asunnon vuoteen 2020 menness
5198007 he was very adamant about going back out for the ninth
5198008 which is a good thing when you can you like to reward them for all the other times weve had to take them out
5198009 its always good when you give your team and your bullpen a break
5198010 more than anything thats what i was trying to do and as you go in the game and then you see how everything is coming along i was just trying to do my job if you get a shutout great if not
5198011 four runs i felt was enough for the way he was performing i had no thought about it at all
5198012 im a pitcher im not a hitter i dont want to talk about my hitting
5198013 i was very aggressive throwing the first pitch for strikes
5198014 that allowed me to go out there for the ninth i was just doing my job
5198015 he was adamant about going back out there which is always a good thing
5198016 were executing for the most part in different facets of the game those are still things you must do no matter who youre playing these are games you would like to win but its baseball so you never know
5198017 hitting in front of johan i didnt think i would get too many chances
5198018 were going to try to work through it with him
5198019 the two innings the other day that we faced him he threw strikes attacked the hitters
5198020 now its a grind to the last out regardless of what the score is or whos out there
5198021 you just have to keep grinding to the very last out you just have to play those outs like theyre precious
5198022 hes a guy with a good sinker a four seam that he can throw 92 a good slider that keeps you off the sinker
5198023 jerry told me when he took over that he wanted to get the regulars rest every now and then
5198024 he said it would be an ideal time a righthander day game i dont like taking days but theyre necessary especially coming into august when youre playing 23 24 straight games jerry knows what hes doing hes got a plan and im sure that rest will help me have the kind of stretch run that i want to have to finish strong
5198025 since the invention of the breaking ball there has been no more significant development in baseball than tommy john surgery
5198026 there are a lot of things you wont do but you wouldnt do them anyway in the second preseason game you have a scheduled amount of things that youre trying to do and move on and youre also trying to evaluate a lot of people because of that there are some limitations they are im sure doing the same thing

5198085 we reserve the right to change the schedule when we want and you shouldnt make any assumptions any person speaking on any given night could speak again as vice president
5198086 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
5198087 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
5198088 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
5198089 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5198090 ive always believed there was not significant appreciation of the realities of vladimir putin and i think that its very obvious that as soon as he came to power he went directly to the suppression of chechnya that was the utmost brutality we looked on it somewhat benignly because they were terrorists they were islamic extremists and all that kind of stuff but i think we have not appreciated enough that this individual is interested in restoring the russian empire i dont mean to say that this is the re ignition of the cold war but i do believe that hes hell bent on the restoration of russia as a major power in the world with safe and secure regional interests in a region that is clearly aligned in the russian orbit
5198091 all laws meant for the protection of women in india are gender biased it is high time that ministry for mens welfare was set up in india
5198092 as per data of the crime bureau of india over 72 000 men commit suicide every year suicide of married men is much higher than that of married women indian men have no legal protection
5198093 nevertheless the society is refusing to free man of his traditional duties of protecting and providing shelter for women children and the aged
5198094 men perform some of the most risky and challenging jobs in society and while the government of india collects 82 percent of its tax revenues from men not a single rupee has been allocated in the name of mens welfare in the budget in the last 60 years
5198095 an increasing number of men are losing employment more women are entering the job market and defying their traditional roles within the family and the society
5198096 in addition men are being subjected to severe discrimination under law and their basic human rights are being violated every day in the name of more and more legal provisions that claim to empower and protect women
5198097 in the year 2005 alone nearly twice as many married men 52 483 compared to married women 28 186 committed suicide unable to withstand verbal emotional economic and physical abuse and legal harassment
5198098 the ncrb figures suggest that only two percent of 120 000 men arrested in the country under dowry charges are being convicted which suggests that a large number of men are implicated in false cases
5198099 though anti dowry laws and domestic violence acts are tough and sometimes men become victims of them but it largely helps women get justice in a male dominated society
5198100 the ncrb data also shows that in this vast billion plus nation 25 violent crimes take place every hour 59 housewives commit suicide every day and two rapes four murders 10 culpable homicides and one dowry death occur on an hourly basis
5198101 all laws meant for the protection of women in india are gender biased it is high time that a ministry for mens welfare should be set up in india
5198102 as per data of crime bureau of india more than 72 000 men commit suicide every year suicides by married men are higher than those by married women indian men have no legal protection
5198103 nevertheless society is refusing to free men of their traditional duties of protecting and providing for women children and the aged

5198125 se considera que un alimento es funcional o producto de dise o cuando pruebas cient ficas avalan que su consumo frecuente previene o resuelve determinados problemas de salud
5198126 por supuesto que el consumo de alimentos funcionales que puede ser diario pues no presentan ning n de tipo de contraindicaci n no reemplaza a los f rmacos hipolipemiantes o reductores del colesterol que toda persona con desajustes en sus l pidos debe ingerir se trata simplemente de una herramienta m s en la lucha contra las enfermedades no infecciosas que son el gran drama del siglo xxi y que junto con la actividad f sica y el manejo del estr s puede ayudarnos a dar un pasito m s en la construcci n de un esquema de vida saludable

5198131 all laws meant for the protection of women in india are gender biased it is high time that a ministry for mens welfare was set up in india
5198132 as per data of the crime bureau of india over 72 000 men commit suicide every year suicide of married men is much higher than that of married women indian men have no legal protection
5198133 nevertheless the society is refusing to free man of his traditional duties of protecting and providing shelter for women children and the aged
5198134 while an increasing number of men are losing employment more women are entering the job market and defying their traditional roles within the family and society
5198135 to make things worse male members of a family regardless of their age health or marital status are arrested based on unsubstantiated allegations of dowry harassment and domestic abuse and are subjected to long drawn trials
5198136 not a single rupee has been allocated in the name of mens welfare in the countrys budget in the last 60 years
5198137 ministry of mens welfare to cater to mens needs in the changing society and end the legal terrorism perpetrated through the misuse of anti male anti family laws
5198138 im going to want somebody with integrity im going to want somebody with independence whos willing to tell me where he thinks or she thinks im wrong and im im going to want somebody who shares a vision of the country where we need to go that weve got to fundamentally change not only our policies but how our politics works how business is done in washington
5198139 kaine an early obama supporter whose biography nicely dovetails with the illinois senators
5198140 all this makes kaine a serious vice presidential possibility his social justice catholicism fits seamlessly with obamas social gospel protestantism kaine has a strong civil rights background as a lawyer at a small firm he represented clients in housing discrimination and death penalty cases he has been only a modestly successful governor but proved capable of rising to a large moment in the aftermath of the virginia tech shootings while lacking foreign policy background kaine like obama is viewed by national democrats as a quick study
5198141 w hrend seinen zweieinhalb amtsjahren als gouverneur in virginia sind acht menschen exekutiert worden und das obwohl kaine immer wieder seine ablehnung der todesstrafe deutlich gemacht hat allerdings passt das in gewisser weise auch zu obama der bei diesem hei en wahlkampfthema ebenfalls eine ambivalente haltung einnimmt
5198142 he has kept the states gop on the defensive brought his party to within striking distance of retaking the state legislature and has run a competent administration he doesnt have a major overhaul of the states transportation system to his credit or any other major reform to point to but instead has quietly built his political persona as someone who can work the levers of government play hardball when necessary and operate comfortably in the shadow of larger political personalities
5198143 tim kaine has a message of fiscal responsibility and generosity of spirit that kind of message can sell anywhere
5198144 its flattering to be mentioned my mom loves it she calls me she sees it but thats for the campaign to decide the campaign has made very good decisions thus far and i think however they decide they are going to make a very good decision about sen obamas running mate
5198145 i havent sought it im not running for it im not asking for it i never asked anything of the campaign i didnt endorse him to get anything i endorsed him to help him
5198146 kaine is a very capable guy and would help in virginia but i wonder whether obama should pick someone with even less foreign policy experience than he has
5198147 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates
5198148 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
5198149 i have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making is simply impressive how a candidates unusual gifts have come forth with a singular commitment to recapture the american dream
5198150 last month a abc news washington post poll showed obama and mccain were equally trusted to handle international affairs but mccain had the edge on handling an unexpected major crisis like presumably the one in georgia and mccains supporters are making the most of it
5198151 president medvedev stated that he has halted the offensive but reports indicate russian military forces have continued attacks in some areas and the situation remains fluid and dangerous today the killing goes on and the aggression goes on
5198152 ekaterina is living in a fantasy world to say she has won ronnie is ridiculous particularly as there isnt a competition

5198161 i never thought my little girl would be taking part in the olympics opening ceremony
5198162 now the ceremony is over and my girl has completed her mission
5198163 she told me proudly mum i contributed to our country i am very proud
5198164 we are considering this very closely and i expect to work with mr snowden on this issue he managed the whole question about hmas sydney very well
5198165 about how he would always forget the books he read
5198166 the big miners were playing catch up from lower commodity prices over the weekend but weve seen oil tick up on a weakening us dollar and theres a potential storm brewing over the gulf of mexico
5198167 golds recovered to back over us800 00 an ounce and people are jockeying for position along with the bhp result which is coming out as we speak
5198168 gold medals are awarded in the summer but theyre earned in the winter that was four years of hard winters
5198169 its a very serious issue for households its a very serious issue for business and its a very serious issue for our national economy
5198170 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5198171 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5198172 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks
5198173 what ive said is that we are always looking at the extent of competition within the mortgage market and if the banks dont move ive said the treasury are examining a range of options and all options are on the table
5198174 i knew i had to get out on that run coming down on the last lap i had to throw in whatever i had left theres nothing like running scared i had to make sure i didnt leave anything out on that field i put every ounce of energy into this
5198175 the rising cost of fuel and diminishing natural resources in poor countries are making it increasing difficult for people to eat healthily but these people have found a sustainable and reliable solution in solar cooking technology
5198176 this solar cooking archive wiki really is a global effort we have people from more than 210 different countries around the globe visiting the site with many contributing their expertise about solar cooking
5198177 robbie hasnt played a competitive game since last october so he has been out for a long time
5198178 but he has done well in training and some of the stuff he has done on the training pitch has been mind blowing
5198179 i would not have wished my illness on my worst enemy depression is not the same as feeling down or fed up people might say im a bit depressed today but true depression is quite different
5198180 my mind was pulling itself apart what was happening at home was hayley ok was ellie all right
5198181 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5198182 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5198183 i actually could not believe that these domains were not taken last year so i bought them simply because they had not been taken
5198184 i have been a web designer and webmaster for many years and i thought it very unusual to find that these names were available
5198185 i have not decided what i am going to do with these domains
5198186 i was unaware of him i hope hes a fan but i suspect maybe not
5198187 i hope he doesnt have any illegal or offensive intentions in mind im unaware of any reason to believe he does
5198188 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5198189 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5198190 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5198191 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5198192 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5198193 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5198194 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5198195 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5198196 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5198197 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5198198 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5198199 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5198200 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5198201 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5198202 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5198203 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5198204 you do too much college a job all this time with me youre not superman you know
5198205 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5198206 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5198207 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5198208 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5198209 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5198210 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5198211 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5198212 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5198213 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5198214 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5198215 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5198216 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5198217 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5198218 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5198219 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5198220 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5198221 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5198222 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5198223 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5198224 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5198225 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5198226 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5198227 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5198228 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5198229 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5198230 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5198231 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5198232 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5198233 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5198234 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5198235 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5198236 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5198237 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5198238 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5198239 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5198240 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5198241 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5198242 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5198243 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

5198302 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy

5198328 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5198329 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5198330 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5198331 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5198332 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5198333 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5198334 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5198335 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5198336 we will be presenting the list as part of a resolution and charge sheet in the joint houses and god willing that should happen this week

5198339 this thing must be clear to everyone that president musharraf is not going to resign period
5198340 this is an issue that is not on the table
5198341 we want stability in the country we want political stability
5198342 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5198343 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5198344 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5198345 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5198346 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5198347 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5198348 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
5198349 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
5198350 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
5198351 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5198352 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5198353 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5198354 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5198355 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5198356 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5198357 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5198358 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5198359 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5198360 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5198361 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5198362 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5198363 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5198364 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5198365 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5198366 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5198367 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5198368 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5198369 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5198370 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5198371 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5198372 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5198373 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5198374 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5198375 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5198376 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5198377 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5198378 well i wasnt in charge of the artwork err err

5198404 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5198405 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5198406 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5198407 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5198408 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5198409 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5198410 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5198411 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

5198414 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5198415 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5198416 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5198421 when housing and other non agricultural development extend into agricultural areas farmers can become the subject of unwarranted lawsuits over dirt odor and other customary practices associated with farming the state of california has adopted laws to protect farming but often when agricultural land is bought and sold the purchasers are not aware that these laws exist

5198433 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5198434 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5198435 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5198436 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5198437 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5198438 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5198439 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5198440 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5198441 sending them to put out a fire in the wilderness is both overkill and unnecessary
5198442 firefighters are being ordered to take significant risks of their lives health and safety that are incommensurate with the benefits of suppression
5198443 i have short legs so i have a higher stride per second rate that allows me to go faster
5198444 despite not exactly usain bolt is a physical marvel no doubt about it and like magic he is a pioneer in magics wake has come a 7 footer who prefers playing like a small forward
5198445 luckily i was in the stairway when the explosion hit but they didnt make it
5198446 if there are any georgians here come out and we will take you to safety
5198447 my family doesnt even know if i am dead or alive
5198448 i was watching my house burn and a russian soldier put his gun on me and said dont look just go away my dog barked and an ossetian shot him so i got on the bus
5198449 sure we dont have much and some are very hungry but its not so bad that people should act like this
5198450 i am exhausted but this is my profession i have no right to be soft
5198451 i never thought i would have to ask russians whether or not i could enter or leave my city now i ask them every day when they will leave and every day they go nowhere
5198452 costs for labor materials and supplies and other operating expenses continue to rise
5198453 a reduction in use per customer as a result of conservation more efficient appliances more energy efficient building construction and other factors that negatively affect the companys revenues
5198454 increased customer usage the benefit of rate increases and reduced operating expenses
5198455 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5198456 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5198457 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5198458 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5198459 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5198460 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5198461 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5198462 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5198463 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5198464 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5198465 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5198466 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5198467 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5198468 who are open to doing something on the production side
5198469 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5198470 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5198471 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

5198476 you too can become the next big thing in multi level marketing and your home business will explode
5198477 you too can become a network marketing guru and leads will flock to you
5198478 you didnt really need to do that again since you already did it when you were baptized
5198479 you know thats latex paint good luck getting that off
5198480 yeah its gonna look like you have leggings on for a while
5198481 i had to do a double take and reread it to make sure i understood what was happening
5198482 as far as the pilots and the west gulf proposal all i can say at this time is theres no need for pilots to take any action on the proposal and we have no further comment
5198483 the pilots showed great flexibility and initiative to handle unique traffic needs
5198484 it is very gratifying to me that west gulf was proactive in trying to keep rates competitive and fair
5198485 dreams goals ambitions these are the stuff that man uses for fuel
5198486 if its good for me its even better for my team
5198487 dreams goals ambitions these are what man uses for fuel
5198488 that i will now reveal to a select group of ferocious entrepreneurs
5198489 you too can become the next big thing in multi level marketing and your home business will explode
5198490 you too can become a network marketing guru and leads will flock to you
5198491 video on the internet has been there for a while
5198492 what vlogging is doing is making it easier to share and find
5198493 my thought was to gather it all in one place
5198494 for general sale to a broader set of clients late last week
5198495 the idea is to sell msn video across the entire network
5198496 this is a verification of advertiser and agency interest in video on the internet as being strong enough to compel them to reallocate and reconsider their annual budgets to a larger proportion next year
5198497 the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts
5198498 there is no waste with this deal we need all the people we have
5198499 twenty years from now everyones going to be getting all their video mostly from the internet
5198500 you see it happening with music you see it happening with phone service video is next
5198501 and the only architecture that can bring that is the internet
5198502 youre competing against a lot of consumer electronic gadgets out there and many consumers are paying almost triple digit monthly fees for video entertainment so how much more are consumers going to pay for entertainment in the living room
5198503 if you give people content that theyre passionate about and that they cant get anywhere else theyll be willing to pay for it
5198504 they dont want to go head on right now with cable operators with mainstream content because then theyll be dead
5198505 when i went there were very few video logs on the web and most of them were very introverted
5198506 i wanted to take this video web log concept and go as far away from technology as possible so i took it right into the amazon
5198507 i get up to 500 unique visitors a day nothing compared to tv but a full cinema still
5198508 i set up the site because i saw a need for a portal for independent grassroots video that wanted to affect social change
5198509 people are taught to write from childhood however there is no analogous experience of learning to produce video
5198510 anyone who decides to tell a story and share it
5198511 as tools come out that make it easier more people will start creating video blogs
5198512 the barriers to entry now are the number of steps it takes to get a video published on the web youve got to shoot the video digitise it edit it compress it for web delivery upload it to a host and post it to your blog
5198513 at the moment a lot of people who video log are in schools or institutions where the cost is not an issue and they have access to the technology
5198514 i have done three or four experiments with giving people cell phones they could use to create a video log we got things like a video log of someone recovering in hospital it was very moving its a great way to get people to begin to play around with video
5198515 its a form of self publicity of course anything put out from home pages is self promotion in some form
5198516 it may be that they are trying to get an argument out it may just be a cathartic experience you are never going to get a single answer life can be humdrum and its a way for people to put themselves in touch with the bigger questions and issues
5198517 its just video you dont need something special to run it
5198518 you could easily use standard tools that are cheap and easy for advertisers and publishers
5198519 nous allons nous sp cialiser pour pouvoir utiliser les nouvelles technologies qui vont tre install es sur les sous marins

5198525 lets say youre a fan of the fx show nip tuck and you wanted to see it on tuesday night but you were out and you didnt set your tivo so you say let me hunt it down online people do that all the time people who are fans of the show probably already have fx theyre paying for it now you could say that the harm is in that the distributed version is usually made available without the commercials but if you have a tivo you arent watching the commercials anyway
5198526 technologies that enable redistribution of copyrighted tv programming beyond the local tv market disrupt local advertiser supported broadcasting and harm tv syndication markets essential elements supporting the u s local broadcasting system
5198527 it became apparent that hundreds of people were coming into our irc channel just to ask when new shows would be available just spending a whole lot of time doing nothing but waiting for the new show
5198528 we saw that we could quite easily get this done
5198529 the last time i checked the sales of dvds of television shows were huge way larger than anyone had ever expected
5198530 it doesnt seem to me that the internet trading is harming the market in any substantial way
5198531 todo lo que tenga que ver con preservar los derechos fundamentales de los ciudadanos es favorable
5198532 i like el capitan i know him and respect him but i feel like ive gotten to know you more we have a relationship and i love you
5198533 so how long are we going to get to have you
5198534 who decides that do you decide that or does the church decide it or what
5198535 oh thats good i hope we get to have you for a really long time
5198536 what are you serious do you use that just go bald youd have a great bald head
5198537 youre parked in a handicapped spot thanks for making me walk
5198538 handicapped parking enforcement has not been what it should be
5198539 who has got great multicolored maps of venezuela the yankees
5198540 now we are going to have our own we have to get ready to launch the second satellite which should be for observation for images
5198541 a tunnel would have posed a significant challenge because the rock formation there is not conducive to tunnelling also the cost of the tunnel and associated works would be in the range of 200 million those factors combined together prompted the decision to not go ahead there
5198542 that slope has always been waiting to fail youd have to cut back a huge chunk of the mountain in order to remove the rock that wants to come down
5198543 what theyve done historically there is to trim it back and use rock bolts and cables and whatever means of reinforcement but you can only do so much of those because the mountain is fundamentally unstable
5198544 a tunnel is a very good solution but expensive as a minimum youd be thinking of twin tunnels the last thing youd want is a single tunnel with two lanes in it that is extremely dangerous
5198545 its very difficult and dangerous for any practising consultant in b c to voice an opinion im a little bit less constrained as i am trying to retire
5198546 it was a really poor statement theyve had four rockslides there in 50 years so hes got to do his basic math when it comes to the details of risk management hes a bit out to lunch
5198547 unless they try to park a car in front of my house then its personal
5198548 im not opposed to making 40 or 50 a day selling a couple of spaces in my yard
5198549 i dont know whose interests the city is trying to protect enforcing some bylaws
5198550 on one hand you can see people in the neighbourhood tempted to offer up their own property for parking but on the other hand it takes money away from the fair people enjoy the fair but probably dont realize how much money it takes to put it on
5198551 they could not speak one word of english other than thank you and hi
5198552 we joke that were at the centre of the world
5198553 kinship is very strong its a community that despite its problems really does pull together its not what you do for a living or what colour your skin is but who you are that matters
5198554 we extend our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the young woman who perished in this tragic accident
5198555 i am going to get some advice but i think i might wade in here to set some of the record straight with the media
5198556 sgt pierre lemaitre should be fired for purposely misrepresenting the facts and suppressing the video on a false premise
5198557 its just awful to think theres somebody doing a thing like that to dogs
5198558 i sat on the edge of the bed and i watched and oh it was fantastic
5198559 my eyes welled i cant even imagine what its like in hazelton right now
5198560 the whole thing started about 25 years ago all at once it just took off as a sport smithers houston their high school teams started coming to the provincials and they were strong at every level it became quite a phenomenon up north
5198561 we are not going to do what theyve done you will not need an event ticket to have access to the sponsorship tents or anything else
5198562 when you are downtown you are definitely going to feel the games are on big screens entertainment and a free live site even if you dont have a ticket to the games you can still come downtown and have a good time
5198563 we see video as being a major component in the coming fiscal year 2005 as opposed to not having played a big role in fiscal 2004
5198564 unlike a typical web page with two or three ads there is only one streaming ad for every two video clips so you need a large number of streams to create significant inventory
5198565 video ads are particularly interesting for msnbc com because they tap into broadcast advertising budgets not just internet budgets
5198566 people want to come in and buy 1 million worth of ads in one shot
5198567 the type of people watching streaming are not watching network tv
5198568 the growth is away from music there is a new chairman coming to the mpaa motion picture association of america and he will probably be very aggressive
5198569 there will be a ramping up of activity from the mpaa but there will also be lessons learnt from the riaas approach and i dont expect anything so heavy handed as that
5198570 i would be very surprised if movie downloads were the dominant form of file sharing this is largely because downloading is quite a painful experience for anyone with less than one megabit of bandwidth
5198571 there is a whole generation of file sharers growing up with no concept of music as a paid for commodity
5198572 having said that file sharing remains a challenge to music movie and tv industries alike
5198573 it has global use never sleeps and has no geographical barriers
5198574 it is still at the testing stage but it will revolutionise tv viewing you will able to watch the programmes when you want and because you will be able to watch the shows on handheld computers or some of the more advanced mobile phones you could even take the programmes with you on your commute and watch them on the train or the bus
5198575 ich hoffe er hat am ende gelitten was f r eine schreckliche person
5198576 der zorn der gewinner der ewig heutigen ist ein heiliger religi ser

5198578 seventeen percent of global war on terror veterans develop post traumatic stress disorder
5198579 its a really good way to get the word out about what we offer
5198580 we try to greet each vet personally that way they feel comfortable and they dont have to deal with the bureaucracy
5198581 id gotten out of drug treatment but i ended up on the street in philly
5198582 two women from the coatesville center personally came down and got me
5198583 if it wasnt for them i would be dead literally
5198584 i dont know why were there i didnt know why we were there then either they didnt tell us anything
5198585 i would do other drugs whatever was coming through my house at the time but nothing was like alcohol
5198586 because i was always with convoys i developed really bad road rage
5198587 when i got back and drove around here id be looking for bombs i had this feeling of impending doom like the next thing i knew thered be a mortar coming over the horizon
5198588 taking advantage of olympic games running the top of the new generation its a fun game and has a good taste maybe
5198589 taking advantage of olympic games running the top of the new generation its a fun game and has a good taste maybe
5198590 wait www it completely ignored the copyright law www well to see a game that just changed the name like this i actually feel refreshed
5198591 the game itself was exactly like hyper olympics i enjoyed hitting repeatedly
5198592 the canadian content stuff is frequently at the top of the titles available
5198593 as these are men who desperately want to be in adult movies themselves specifically real productions adult movies they will be very interested in watching a network featuring these movies
5198594 on saturday morning we had three medals in a span of 46 minutes
5198595 so it was nice not to have to put up a medal board that did not include canadians
5198596 ron was trying to get to something out of marks autobiography about what motivated him in barcelona
5198597 i spoke to mark afterward he didnt feel it was inappropriate but wanted to talk more about the swimmers performances
5198598 look at bolt holding nothing back now big strides full speed stopping the clock in a new world record 9 68 no man has ever run that fast in the planet sensational
5198599 i sent him a note saying that don wittman would have been proud
5198600 my aim was just to win i do what i had to do im not worried about that the record right now better to break it small than bigger id say next time i will break it
5198601 they have now gone into the realm of video game times
5198602 es gibt keinen technologischen grund daf r warum man cross plattform nicht realisieren k nnte aber es existiert ein philosophischer grund weswegen die designabteilung es nicht will wenn wir eine plattform beeintr chtigen m ssen um beide zu unterst tzen werden wir es nicht tun
5198603 einige leute aus unserem team haben eine menge erfahrungen mit der arbeit an shadowrun gesammelt egal wie sehr man es optimiert man hat am ende eine polarisierte community
5198604 die pc leute sagen dass die ps3 spieler eine zielhilfe haben und ihre steuerung vereinfacht wurde und die ps3 leute antworten dass die pc gamer ber maus sowie keyboard verf gen und es somit einfacher f r sie w re selbst wenn es nicht wahr ist
5198605 ich w rde mich daher eher darauf konzentrieren all diese k stlichen best ndigen daten sowie die community f higkeiten zu nehmen und interessantere wege zu finden mit denen man sie zusammenf hren kann
5198606 he just saw us online and hes on his way here
5198607 people may mock it but 10 years from now all our content is going to be delivered like this
5198608 ive been doing an old time radio site since they invented the internet
5198609 its challenging to find out what im not going to get sued over
5198610 i would have thought that everyone who wanted to see it had seen it
5198611 but after we started on winamp tv were getting e mails from new viewers all the time
5198612 there are very few people doing this on a regular basis
5198613 we put some tools out there but its not easy the jurys still out on whether this is a mass market thing
5198614 how do you get it from your garage to the web
5198615 regarding on demand video services several key pieces of the puzzle are now in place
5198616 broadband penetration is sufficiently high and with the launch of service providers like movielink and starz ticket movies are legally available in on demand environments the only missing piece is a wireless connection between tvs and pcs and this should be available within the next 12 months thanks to new products coming to market
5198617 we havent offered any of our dot com budget as added value for several years now and the espn motion is our most sought after and most valuable inventory we have to sell compared with sponsorships and banners
5198618 i think well see a more successful broadband upfront next year in terms of integration between online and offline advertising and with agencies realigning themselves internally
5198619 the jury is still out but is going to report soon
5198620 on whether one of two models for tv over internet will prevail
5198621 if youre an isp looking at this now is not the time to make a big bet on it not yet but its going to be really big in 2005
5198622 my gut and this is religious is that i think the tivo model will win it can be the equivalent of voip people will be able to get video so much cheaper by going this way that its really going to take the cable companies off at the knees
5198623 in cable television now theres a real drive for scale
5198624 the bigger you are the better the deal youre going to get if you have 10 000 subscribers youll get one deal with disney if youve got 100 000 it will be somewhat better if youve got 10 million subscribers youll get a great deal from disney
5198625 new to our sea eagle boatnbag packages are the 710
5198626 dont even think about the sea eagle 330 without our deluxe kayak seats
5198627 im extremely pleased with the sea eagle se330 inflatable kayak i have used in in my local lake as well as the river and canal
5198628 america is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold its patriotism its morality and its spiritual life if we can undermine these three areas america will collapse from within
5198629 the us is in very real danger from a politically ignorant uninformed electorate
5198630 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict
5198631 when an audience does not complain it is a compliment amp when they do it is a compliment too if unaccompanied by violence
5198632 the men american people admire most extravagantly are the most daring liars
5198633 he who is compassionate to the cruel will ultimately become cruel to the compassionate
5198634 a liberal is someone who feels a great debt to his fellow man which
5198635 good people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf
5198636 no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms the strongest reason for people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government
5198637 the eu recorded music industry has suffered a decline in record sales sales of music cds peaked in 2000 and have been falling at an average rate of 6 ever since
5198638 the european record industry faces the challenge of keeping up the steady revenue stream necessary to invest in new talent a longer term of protection would generate additional income to help finance new talent and would allow record companies to better spread the risk in developing new talent
5198639 the large scale production of phonograms is essentially a phenomenon that commenced in the 1950s
5198640 we sent a big message every time we go on the court were trying to send a message to the whole field no matter who we are playing
5198641 catchings was unbelievable what she brought the loose balls the blocks the tips the way she locked up valdemoro who had given us problems in that stretch i felt she completely changed the game for us on the defensive end
5198642 it meant a lot to us we wanted to keep the pressure on them kind of redeem ourselves this was a payback game for us and we knew people were wondering how we were going to respond
5198643 we sent a big message every time we go on the court were trying to send a message to the whole field no matter who we are playing
5198644 catchings was unbelievable what she brought the loose balls the blocks the tips the way she locked up valdemoro who had given us problems in that stretch i felt she completely changed the game for us on the defensive end
5198645 it meant a lot to us we wanted to keep the pressure on them kind of redeem ourselves this was a payback game for us and we knew people were wondering how we were going to respond
5198646 stream over stream or in stream video in the launch product is a place where broadband advertising makes a lot of sense they have lots of content and the user is expecting to see sight sound and motion
5198647 we are fairly agnostic about video being included in cutting edge ad units
5198648 it is as close to a cut and paste of a tv commercial as you could imagine
5198649 meaning even if someone buys two 15s we would not play two 15s in a row before a music video
5198650 the embedded unit allows an internet buyer to think about yahoo s network and to overlay video we think that thats going to be very popular with media buyers
5198651 when we have the opportunity to talk to tv people we are showing examples of both units and where were making progress with tv people is usually when its an agency where internally theyre closely integrated with internet media units
5198652 less video was sold through the upfront than we had expected its still partially a timing issue but a lot of good groundwork was laid for next year
5198653 our primary business serves pr public relations agencies advertisers and advertising agencies
5198654 right now our focus and main interest is the b2b side
5198655 once consumers understand the role advertising plays in the reduction of fees
5198656 the interest rate freeze is good news but its just a respite the economic uncertainty is not over yet
5198657 hard pressed consumers should see the reserve banks decision as a second chance for them to get their finances in order not a sign that things are on the up and they can start spending again
5198658 so we really are not out of the woods yet particularly as house prices are continuing to stall and food and energy costs are still up despite the oil price fall
5198659 he blasts through stereotypes pure style and creation you need to hear him
5198660 in het begin van de wedstrijd hadden we moeite met het spel van de argentijnen maar na een kwartier spelen gingen we toch aardig voetballen de goal kwam wel gelukkig tot stand maar daarna werd het wel een echte confrontatie
5198661 ik voelde dat het goed zat we hadden eigenlijk teveel tijd nodig misschien waren we anders wat verder geweest maar dat is ook voetbal
5198662 tijdens de voorbereidingsweek in hongkong ben ik misschien iets te confronterend naar spelers geweest het was wellicht slimmer om het op een andere manier aan te pakken deze groep is tenslotte niet gelijk aan die van het afgelopen jeugd ek veel spelers die meer op zichzelf zijn maar daar was deze uitschakeling zeker niet aan te wijten
5198663 all you have to do is write and people will read it and believe it
5198664 whats happened over the past two years is that agencies rep firms solutions providers and content sites have determined that as streaming media has grown in reach it can in fact be supported by advertising and broadcast media budgets are targets everyone is aiming for
5198665 brand advertisers want the impact of video messaging delivered to high speed users and in 2004 more branded content moved out from behind subscription services inventory is increasing and cpms are holding firm
5198666 on the internet radio side rep firms now pitch inventory using the same reach and listener metrics as on air radio with everyone speaking the same language there is a better chance to attract national advertisers
5198667 ministers have agreed that as in the wake of the june 2007 floods funds should be made available to local councils to help those most affected by the weekends serious floods
5198668 i have been in contact with colleagues in the executive and we are in agreement that funding should be made available through local councils to help people most severely affected to get back on their feet again and to assist them in ensuring their homes are habitable
5198669 the roads service has serious questions to answer about how the new westlink underpass could be flooded so quickly
5198670 i viewed the broadway underpass on sunday morning and it took the workers all day to deal with the flood water
5198671 this means traffic chaos as the main route in to belfast is impassable the roads service will have to explain how this could happen and what steps they are going to take to ensure this does not happen again
5198672 thats primarily because a studio is often in the market for a place that can hold a block of 400 rooms or so for them over an extended period that pretty much rules out macombs hotel community
5198673 the way its been explained to us we should expect a downturn in film related activity after about mid november until things start up again sometime in march thats sort of a regular season for location filming
5198674 unless you have something with a script calling for a lot of snow
5198675 this new business will support the bottom line of our two hotels in downtown detroit through a very difficult 2008 and we see it continuing into 2009 and beyond
5198676 and it is pure economic impact with taxi dollars car rentals equipment office space restaurant visits shopping staffing and so much more
5198677 the brain drain away from michigan has been no secret but one thing coming out of incentives is that a lot of ex michiganders as we expected are coming home to film theres been a return of talent
5198678 and there seems to be a dearth of film projects in nearby states like illinois right now largely because no ones matching what were doing
5198679 theres little doubt that tiger woods injury put a dent in the turnout for pga
5198680 and since 2009 will be a tough year for convention related travel to detroit and corporate travel continues to decline in the region these film projects could mean survival for some in the hotel industry
5198681 taking just one film you cant really compare them to a super bowl or a pga for attraction
5198682 but taken overall as a trend theyre probably much better
5198683 i cant stress enough the importance of using the fine arts painting music writing to help children work through these situations

5198733 kita masih tetap menyokong anwar dan menyatakan bahawa beliau tidak bersalah

5198738 there is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full should that occur absolutely no excuse
5198739 it may be interesting to see whether there was any discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates which seem to have become the interest rates that the rba has become most interested in for policy purposes
5198740 in recent times the cost of borrowing money short term has come down and that is a considerable benefit to the banks

5198776 this includes for example education housing nutrition and cultural wellbeing
5198777 there has been huge squandering of money with this intervention which could have been better spent
5198778 we need long term commitment to the social determinants of health based on culturally safe community consultation

5198787 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5198788 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5198789 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5198822 future cents has been around since 1998 and we have had many many success stories and we are only one of the agencies in the group
5198823 they need community whether its an arts community or a sports community or anything to help them build relationships outside the hardcore community
5198824 when they get those outside street life opportunities they meet mentors that build their capacity and they continue to move on away from the at risk lifestyle
5198825 these success stories of course do not erase the current concerns about public safety
5198826 however these stories illustrate real life triumphs and encourage hope and inspiration youth have and are capable of making healthy choices given the will and adequate supports to move forward in their lives as a community we cannot pin blame and responsibility solely on youth youth are just part of the picture they are the underlings in the gang world they should be held accountable for their actions but there is a deep rooted element that is not visible a higher echelon that is the mastermind behind gang violence

5198871 los jugadores son los primeros que se tienen que adaptar al sistema debido a que la gente quiere que el equipo juegue bien y gane no viene a ver un sistema viene a ver jugar bien al equipo y creo que hoy por ayer por momentos gust ver al equipo porque busc el partido de distintas maneras me parece que hicimos un partido muy completo donde jugamos casi siempre en campo rival sin darle la posibilidad a ellos de atacarnos
5198872 creo que la posici n de ponzio es muy importante porque nos da vuelo futbol stico desde muy atr s y tiene una velocidad que soluciona muchas situaciones pero no descarto para nada volver a jugar con cuatro atr s debido a que lo conocemos muy bien y tenemos otras variantes es bueno que el equipo pueda tener estas dos situaciones para cuando las necesitemos todos los defensores anticiparon muy bien a los delanteros de ellos villagra jug de stopper e hizo un gran partido
5198873 creamos muchas situaciones ante un equipo cerrado pero el gol no llegaba y comenzaban los apuros el gol lleg en el momento m s esperado

5198912 hes really a guy that has to be feared out there

5198914 i think the games i started last year just got me used to being out there and i learned a lot so now im at a level where im not thinking that much just going out there and playing

5198919 unottima risposta istituzionale alle notizie che hanno campeggiato sulle pagine dei giornali nei giorni scorsi che vedevano la discriminazione di alcuni studenti diversamente abili da parte di agenzie immobiliari questi ragazzi si sono visti opporre un vergognosa rifiuto alla loro legittima richiesta di ottenere in locazione un immobile
5198920 che la prossima risposta istituzionale possa essere una legge per perseguire penalmente comportamenti del genere
5198921 dopo tante conquiste a livello sociale e tecnologico nei confronti dei disabili inaccettabile che ancora oggi assistiamo ad episodi del genere che ci catapultano indietro nel tempo nel mezzo di pagine della storia che ormai pensavamo fossero per sempre archiviate
5198922 come presidente del movimento nazionale italia dei diritti aderisco in pieno al sit in di protesta organizzato per venerd 27 questo senza dubbio un episodio molto grave di intimidazione nei confronti della comunit omosessuale con la quale solidarizzo pienamente bisogna lavorare molto sul piano culturale per incuneare nel tessuto sociale idee di tolleranza e per tentare di arginare i bacilli dellomofobia che purtroppo si annidano nelle menti annebbiate dallignoranza e spesso portate fuori strada da cattive interpretazioni della religione in alcuni casi infatti sono anche le posizioni inopportunamente omofobiche del vaticano e di alcuni politici affetti dal virus dellipocrisia a rendere pi teso il clima di intolleranza

5198925 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5198926 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5198927 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
5198928 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
5198929 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
5198930 or russia joining the world trade organisation our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
5198931 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
5198932 the fact that ukraine is no longer a party to the 1992 agreement with russia allows it to launch active cooperation with european countries to integrate its information
5198933 reiterates with the greatest firmness its condemnation of the coup that took place in mauritania
5198934 we dont know what has happened and under what conditions he has been released but he is definitely coming home and i hope he is coming home for a long time
5198935 this release comprises one of the conditions imposed by the european union for a gradual resumption of dialogue with belarus
5198936 i see this as an important victory for democratic society
5198937 his release will significantly improve the political environment for the election campaign

5198954 this is really the key stat that helped make the decision very easy for us
5198955 does not see shrink wrapped software going away anytime soon
5198956 if you go to the retail stores you probably see that the amount of shelf space that they give to packaged software has declined but its still one of our best channels the place that we get most of our new customers and were still excited about it
5198957 in the online world you can literally change some of that stuff real time
5198958 when someone goes into a retail store looking for personal financial software theyre going to see quicken
5198959 theres plenty of free programs out there and a lot of them are really good
5198960 what we want to do is make the experience of remembering as simple as possible
5198961 there are endless things from that standpoint of any service you might be inspired to interact with when youre not by your computer
5198962 people have been given the power to create their own movies and share them and its opened the gates for other forms of media
5198963 a lot of people enjoy playing games and theyre excited by the idea of making games but they dont know how to go about it
5198964 the desire has been there for a long time but its only now the technology is making it easier to put the power into peoples hands
5198965 its empowering people it makes people feel they made something cool
5198966 what is unique is we do it in a way the casual audience can be the game designer with boom blox anyone can get in there and create
5198967 the games are so huge and expensive these days and theres only so much game you can give a consumer so it makes sense to expand it out to a huge audience of people
5198968 even if only 1 percent of players get into creating thats a ton of content you can offer that extends the life of the game
5198969 it remains to be seen if this will work there hasnt been a game that gives you this much freedom to create and share
5198970 a lot of companies turn to youtube to raise awareness of global concerns like renewable energy climate change or poverty now socially conscious businesses are following suit by leveraging their brands to showcase important issues and encourage people to get involved
5198971 its the companys opportunity to get into pretty personal communication and interaction with its own customers
5198972 they strengthen their brand by putting a face to things customers can hear and see them talk
5198973 the earthkeeper channel on youtube is one of several vehicles by which we seek to engage consumers in a dialogue around the environment and climate change
5198974 the reason we chose to sponsor a contest on youtube is because video is such a popular and powerful medium that allows consumers to explore very creative stimulating methods of communicating their messages
5198975 companies have an interest to be perceived as socially responsible but they want to sell their products at the same time
5198976 youtube is a new vehicle and companies are offering these types of media therefore the spots are not completely altruistic theres an element of both selling and doing good
5198977 he not only indicated the problem of climate change but he also set a new form of demonstration short clips brief presentations
5198978 no company can ignore the whole climate problem i have no doubt that the pr department of every company is telling their bosses we have to have a presence because its part of being in business today

5198982 the matter is of interest because mr mccain who followed mr obamas hourlong appearance in the forum was asked virtually the same questions as mr obama
5198983 mr mccains performance was well received raising speculation among some viewers especially supporters of mr obama that he was not as isolated during the obama interview as mr warren implied
5198984 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5198985 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5198986 reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5198987 repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated in last nights forum at saddleback church
5198988 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5198989 russia wont leave georgia for weeks and it will never withdraw from abkhazia and south ossetia
5198990 they will create every kind of diplomatic language to stay there
5198991 there is no such notion any more in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
5198992 mr saakashvili as a commander in chief is a loser his policy has collapsed
5198993 one day of railway stoppage will have its effect on the georgian economy but more so on the delivery of humanitarian aid
5198994 of course the fires are causing panic in the local population
5198995 there are a lot of questions to ask the president
5198996 i think mr buffett made one small mistake should have bet on a total stock market fund not an s amp p fund needs the kick and diversification of small caps and mid caps
5198997 its hard to make tough decisions when everybody disagrees with you even when youre right
5198998 always remember the people you met on your way up because you may meet them when you fall down
5198999 even the best and brightest can be idiots sometimes lookout for yourself
5199000 identify and focus on the critical few issues resolve them and go on to the next critical few
5199001 invest your energy in those things that are within your control things that are outside of your control are your environment and can not be influenced any more than you can influence the weather
5199002 if youre ever angry or frustrated by a situation you have two basic choices either change the situation if possible or change the way you think about it
5199003 next time you have to deal with a stupid person thank them it is because of the stupid people you look smart
5199004 no matter where you go in life no matter who you are adressing look them directly in the eye it shows you have the upmost respect for yourself and for them it will change your life
5199005 if you cannot live with it just get out of it never complain
5199006 if you want to be a beacon you have to let your light shine
5199007 there are a lot of great people doing good things in the world but there arent that many good people doing great things always strive to do great things in everything you do
5199008 dont wish that it was easier wish that you were better
5199009 frankly we considered relocating to china altogether although we discarded that option

5199019 the information we are getting indicates that the kidnappers killed the wfp officer because the man who was with them managed to escape when the gunmen opened fire on them
5199020 they kidnapped the officer his driver and another relative on friday night
5199021 the man who escaped told us that the un officer and his driver were killed by the militias and this information seems to be true because some people who went to the scene saw blood

5199028 from the outside we receive grace from the one god without the trinity being clear until we can actually be drawn into that divine community when christ came in the flesh

5199047 such was the discovery of the dead sea scrolls manuscripts a thousand years older than the oldest known hebrew texts of the bible manuscripts many of which were written a hundred years before the birth of jesus and at least one of which may have been written almost three hundred years before the journey of mary and joseph to bethleham
5199048 in the spring of 1986 at the end of his stay in jerusalem professor eisenman went with the british scholar philip davies of the university of sheffield to see one of the israeli officials responsible for this an intermediary on behalf of the antiquities department now authority and the international team and the scrolls curator at israel museum
5199049 eisenman was preparing the facsimile edition of all unpublished plates this was scheduled to appear the following spring through e j brill in leiden holland ten days however before its scheduled publication in april 1991 after pressure was applied by the international team the publisher inexplicably withdrew and hershel shanks author of biblical archaeology review and the biblical archaeology society to their credit stepped in to fill the breach
5199050 the most significant development since 1986 in this regard has been the discovery of the title
5199051 as we have suggested contrary to the well known two messiah theory of early qumran scholarship these references to the messiah of aaron and israel in the damascus document are singular not plural and one possible explanation for it is that it is evoking a messiah with both priestly and kingly implications like the somewhat similar recitations of hebrews
5199052 according to the dominant view in the sectarian texts from qumran two messiahs were to lead the congregation in the end of days one priestly and the other lay
5199053 and fight against them until persecution is no more and religion is for god alone but if they desist then let there be no hostility except against wrongdoers
5199054 those unto whom we gave the scripture recognise him muhammad as they recognise their sons but verily a party of them conceal the truth while they know it
5199055 think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
5199056 it pesher habakkuk describes the struggle between the teacher of righteousness and his opponents the man of lies also termed the spouter or preacher of lies and the wicked priest the spouter is pictured as heading a community the dispute between the teacher and the spouter is seems to have been based on matters of religious interpretation and law the wicked priest is said to have begun his rule in truth but then to have abandoned the way of truth he then persecutes the teacher confronting him on the holiest day of the year the day of atonement
5199057 this text also mentions the familiar dramatis personae the teacher of righteousness termed the priest the wicked priest and the man of lies the wicked priest persecuted the teacher and sought to kill him the man of lies lead people astray
5199058 the wicked watches for the righteous seeking to put him to death
5199059 the wicked priest began his career with the support of the sectarians but he quickly lost his way and began to transgress in order to increase his wealth
5199060 and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver
5199061 various theories have sought to identify the teacher with jesus claiming that he was executed by the wicked priest
5199062 the lord will not abandon him the righteous into his hand the wicked he the lord will not let him the righteous be condemned in judgement by the wicked
5199063 the enemies of the wicked priest the nation against whom he had made war are said to have tortured him so that his life ended in mortal disease and affliction
5199064 you will not believe me if i say otherwise so why fight it any more
5199065 but when jesus became conscious of their disbelief he cried who will be my helpers in the cause of allah the disciples said we will be allahs helpers we believe in allah and bear you witness that we have surrendered unto him our lord we believe in that which you have revealed and we follow him whom you have sent enrol us among those who witness to the truth and they the disbelievers schemed and allah schemed against them and allah is the best of schemers
5199066 and because of their saying we slew the messiah jesus son of mary allahs messenger and they slew him not nor crucified but it appeared so unto them and lo those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture for of a surety they slew him not
5199067 some texts also speak about an eschatological prophet who will announce the coming of the messiah a figure similar to elijah in the rabinnic tradition
5199068 this text unquestionably refers to two messiahs who will be announced by an eschatological prophet and based on a the cave 4 manuscripts of rule of the community the original publication team argued that this passage was added to the text later in the history of the sect however the evidence in these manuscripts does not sufficiently support such an assertion as far as we can tell the two messiah concept was part of rule of the community from the time it was composed
5199069 and when there came unto them the jews a scripture from allah confirming that in their possession though before that they were invoking allah for the coming of muhammad in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved then when there came unto them that which they had recognised they disbelieved in it so let the curse of allah be on disbelievers

5199075 it definitely means a lot just getting a win but it also means a lot just being able to finally get one in san diego
5199076 any time you come home you want to do the best you possibly can
5199077 we werent able to really go out there and succeed
5199078 i think thats more the focus its all about the team when you start focusing on your own goals youre going to get yourself in trouble the ultimate goal is to get to the playoffs and get to the world series one win doesnt really mean anything a 5 2 record would have been a lot better
5199079 i think i false started then i kind of hesitated it was really a rookie mistake
5199080 no one expected me to win so there was no pressure
5199081 and hed be like man the pizza is good today

5199097 the researchers figure were getting about 117 hours of leisure per week including sleep vs 110 hours in 1965 thats more than 360 additional idle hours per year
5199098 the ability to examine different patterns in time use over four decades hinges critically on the quality of data within each of the time use surveys
5199099 any definition that distinguishes leisure from work is a matter of judgment
5199100 after all were a much richer country than we were in 1965 and were enjoying our wealth just as economic theory would predict sweating less and having more is the whole idea
5199101 by global standards were lazy weve been getting lazier and the days of the american dolce vita may be numbered
5199102 president bushs approval rating has reached a new low for his presidency the latest usa today gallup poll reveals a new high in opposition to the iraq war and the presidents role in the immigration debate as the reasons for the loss of confidence in him the poll shows only 29 percent of americans approve of the presidents job performance which means that during his presidency george w bush now has both the highest presidential rating in gallups polling history at 90 percent and one of the lowest only harry truman richard nixon and jimmy carter had lower approval ratings
5199103 but again president bush isnt alone the american public has the lowest confidence in congress since gallup began asking this question in 1973 a recent usa today gallup poll shows just 14 percent of americans have confidence in the job congress is doing
5199104 federal workers are like old guns they dont work and cannot be fired
5199105 are americans less ethical instead of being stereotyped as lazier

5199107 youre kidding right lazy we are working more hours than what is being
5199108 big 4 accounting firms some of my co workers have pulled 20 hours shifts basically spending the night in the office
5199109 if we are lazy and have so much more leisure time that in 1965 how come my minimum owrk week is 65 hours vs 40 for my father
5199110 i know i know youre working harder than ever and so is your spouse but were not talking about you were talking about the whole country on average and im afraid the findings are dramatic
5199111 now thats a but complex but overall its brainpower and innovation that make americans great workers if that means we have more free time because we are more efficient thats great but thats not laziness thats using our creativity and brainpower to our advantage over what others are doing around the world
5199112 you only talk about hours what about productivity you can not jsut use hour of work as measurement we are the most efficient nation comaring to others we do not need work too many hours to compensate incompetence like the rest of the world
5199113 i believe in quality of life work life balance all that stuff but thats the competition
5199114 general electric chief jeff immelt put it bluntly while recalling a trip to beijing last year when he got a big order from the transport ministry

5199117 societis in this country one made up of people who work a lot infact i dare to sy that many of us put in way over 50 60 and even 80 hours a week then there is a growing percentage of people who do not work at all work on occasion work part time etc
5199118 work hard when youre working then get out of the office in time to have the life you want
5199119 compounding the effect fewer of us work at all with growing numbers of people spending more time in retirement
5199120 we have increased our leisure time enormously over the past 40 years so much so that it
5199121 americans work harder than almost any other nation in the world we have less vacation time less benefits and less guarentee of a decent retirement than any of the european nations or canada
5199122 better educational programs in the sciences and math are needed in the united states to prepare our students for careers in the science and engineering fields
5199123 none of this i have to pick up my kids at school nonesense
5199124 fewer of us work at all with growing numbers of people spending more time in retirement
5199125 a salary of 40 000 yr is a lot of money for me american students expect 60 000 yr for the same position why would corporations pay more for an american student when they can save 20k and get an employee with an equal if not greater than gpa
5199126 big 4 accounting firms some of my co workers have pulled 20 hours shifts basically spending the night in the office
5199127 nobody ever said from their death bed i wish id have spent one more day at the office

5199129 work is not all that its cracked up to be

5199135 more important in the growing number of jobs not paid by the hour people who work harder may just produce better results

5199137 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
5199138 i cant describe it in words its just not possible to me
5199139 its as simple as that my son underwent an operation and the only reason he managed to get that treatment is because i am earning money i have no choice
5199140 i have total respect for her i dont know how she does it she really is amazing in our eyes im really glad she medaled
5199141 its been four long years of heartache that weve had to relive over and over
5199142 for us to go home with a silver medal is truly an honor
5199143 i dont want the world to remember team usa as being failures
5199144 guys are trying to get used to each other especially in the preseason weve got guys rotating in and out so much youre hardly ever next to the same guy i think thats part of it thats why you play preseason games to get the timing down
5199145 its a little bit of both having new guys in new positions and getting used to the technique and executing your blocks
5199146 at the same time the other team is making plays we have to make and finish plays rather than allow them to get into the lanes were supposed to keep them out of
5199147 right now we kind of have an idea whos going to be out there were trying to roll some guys in including some of the younger guys who we may not have seen in a game setting
5199148 i was thinking about running before i even made the catch
5199149 im thinking about everything you cant do nothing without the ball im trying to make a play instead of focusing on little things
5199150 the most important thing on offense is to secure the ball first whether it be a handoff catching a pass or fielding a punt
5199151 as far as special teams ive never done it i want to go out and prove to myself that i can do it
5199152 special teams is all about effort its a one play kind of situation
5199153 you dont get to line up on second down and remake anything special teams requires you to go 100 percent
5199154 watching the films what i see is a lot of guys here learning the system working to get into place
5199155 its preseason right now and its trial and error were going to get better by the time the season comes
5199156 the lanes on the punt returns you have to be patient back there im seeing some lanes but it seems hard to get to them but im going to stay patient and work on it
5199157 i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing
5199158 that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world
5199159 the hardest thing at the olympics in the high jump is just getting to the finals
5199160 slovenia is a small country it will be a big celebration im sure
5199161 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
5199162 old competitions i played back home kept running through my head and calmed me
5199163 i said that the last time this happened the last time the reason was katy this time i dont know what the reason is yet but im sure something goods going to come from it
5199164 the rest of the boat was still rowing i put my oar down i was done
5199165 were really proud to be in the same league as those amazing women
5199166 before we left princeton we all gathered together at my house and we watched the 1984 race and it was really inspiring
5199167 just to see those women be so cool when it was neck and neck and they pulled away at the end thats what we envisioned
5199168 it felt like we got faster put it that way
5199169 on the schuylkill at college thats where i fell in love with this sport
5199170 probably the most professional group ive ever worked with no fear
5199171 they came down smiling to the boathouse today which was a good sign
5199172 when i was young i always dreamed about finishing in the top 10 in the olympics
5199173 but after sydney i realized that if i was going to do that i probably had to move up to the marathon
5199174 my times are getting better and im doing something i love
5199175 i went through a hurricane in fort myers when i was in class a ball in 1995 and we didnt play for a week
5199176 im scared people will be evacuating and the dumb angels are going there
5199177 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5199178 this is unbelievable were winning races were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5199179 thats how golf goes its four rounds 72 holes and anything can happen
5199180 enough of all the curse this the curse that the goat the black cat or the 100 years
5199181 i patted him on the head and just said go bonner
5199182 bronze is awesome my first olympics my first olympic medal
5199183 the dutch were just sitting and the australians in fifth and poles in sixth were just sitting
5199184 i said all right boys were in fourth lets go to bronze right now ready and go they responded we started getting out and it became a three way race
5199185 its almost like you go in a hole and pray to god you come out the other end
5199186 its always a risky move because if you go too far in the hole and someone else has something left it will hit you right on the backside its risky but its rewarding when it pays off
5199187 people said to me going in this is a lot of pressure
5199188 we kind of lie and say aaaah no thats ok im from philly so fibbing comes naturally to us
5199189 i went to high school with marcus dad we were in the same class
5199190 he was the toughest guy in the class not the biggest but the toughest marcus has worked really hard and hes come a long way and i hope it continues
5199191 when the yeah yeah yeahs played the modern sky festival a three day event at haidian park on the west side of beijing the fans waited in reverential silence between songs but erupted once the music kicked in with fists in the air and young women screaming in the front
5199192 there is time but you dont want to get too far behind
5199193 at this time of the year if you get five or six games behind its not like you cant do it but youve really got to play good and the team ahead of you has got to fold or go through a bad streak
5199194 im open for suggestions ill listen to what anybodys got to say fans cab drivers
5199195 its very important that you stay upbeat and you stay cool and you stay relaxed were definitely trying if anything maybe were trying too hard the only reason i say that is because we take fastballs and we swing at balls out of the strike zone if we dont win its our fault because we are definitely capable of winning our division we definitely can control our destiny
5199196 he pitched himself right into some 2 0 3 1 counts thats not good hes a contact guy he doesnt throw in the strike zone hes not going to be out there long
5199197 he just made some mistakes early in the game and the guys hit him
5199198 otherwise that doesnt happen to him too often some days that happens
5199199 continue being a nice girl and you will remain single for the rest of your life

5199209 the arab league mission is tasked to hold direct contacts with the somali government and all the other parties in somalia whether political or popular
5199210 as a first stage the arab league office in somalia will look into the situation there in order to determine the governments and the peoples needs on the humanitarian level in terms of health medicine and hospitals
5199211 it will also study the possibility of dispatching special medical missions and providing other humanitarian services as a preliminary step towards offering these services directly
5199212 as for the second stage the arab league is studying the educational and cultural needs in the country which lacks support
5199213 future plans include providing private universities with arab expertise and providing their libraries with books in an effort to improve the level of education
5199214 this is an erroneous conclusion from the very start the arab league did not distance itself from somalia but the truth is that the somalis have distanced themselves not only from the arab league but from the entire world
5199215 the somalis have not exploited the helping hand that has been extended to them by the arab league and other regional and international organizations
5199216 i openly and regretfully say that the somalis were the ones who pledged to end the conflict in somalia at every conference they attended whether in nairobi cairo or djibouti however they never adhered to what they had agreed
5199217 logic suggests that a person should help himself first before his brothers come to support him nevertheless unfortunately the somalis do not help themselves and some of them blame others for not helping them
5199218 the djibouti agreement marked the beginning of an ease of tension however this agreement needs following up commitment and implementation the signatories to this agreement namely the government and the opposition as well as other somali parties must face one truth that is that no party can achieve all its demands accordingly it is better for everyone to achieve fewer demands than to lose everything
5199219 making concessions is not a shameful act the expression no winner and no loser applies to the somali situation as the best way towards reaching a solution
5199220 we are willing to offer support but the question that arises is whom will we support we want the brothers in somalia to give us an honest answer to this question the arab league does not support tribes political parties or sects rather it supports states and peoples through recognized mechanisms
5199221 my task here is to find a means for supporting somalia i hope that the brothers in somalia will weigh up matters properly
5199222 this is also not true i have heard this in many places it is true that the relationship between egypt and somalia has been strong since the independence and before that however the arab league represents all arab states and not one state only
5199223 if an arab state enjoys a special relationship with another arab or non arab state it is only natural for the arab league to benefit from this relationship and improve its relation with that state this is because everyone is working to achieve one interest that is reinforcing joint arab action
5199224 such a visit will take place if the security and political circumstances in somalia allow it when this visit takes place it will not be just for the sake of visiting rather it will be in an effort to achieve a specific goal which in this case is to achieve progress in the ongoing efforts to resolve the somali problem

5199537 sebelum memberitahukan saya sesuatu saya ingin anda melewati sebuah ujian kecil ujian tersebut dinamakan ujian saringan tiga kali
5199538 sebelum anda mengatakan kepada saya mengenai teman saya mungkin merupakan ide yang bagus untuk menyediakan waktu sejenak dan menyaring apa yang akan anda katakan itulah kenapa saya sebut sebagai ujian saringan tiga kali saringan yang pertama adalah kebenaran sudah pastikah anda bahwa apa yang anda akan katakan kepada saya adalah benar

5199541 the president will address the nation at 1 00 pm 0700 gmt
5199542 the president is determined to defend himself he will fight on he has given no indication that he will accept the charges against him
5199543 there is a strong possibility that he might announce his resignation but there is equally a chance that he might commit a blunder
5199544 our stance is still the same that those who violated the constitution should not be given safe passage or indemnity of his actions

5199572 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters and in that single note hope i heard something else at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild

5199587 waiting to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates would be too late
5199588 i often hear now a days the automobile instigated good roads that the automobile is the parent of good roads well the truth is the bicycle is the father of the good roads movement in this country the league of american wheelmen precursor to todays fought for equal privileges with horse drawn vehicles all these battles were won and the bicyclist was accorded equal rights with other users of highways and streets
5199589 consumer spending is going to slow and it will be slower to rebound for reasons outlined above that will also make the recovery in the stock market a little slower but i expect to become bullish on the market sometime this summer if not before im looking forward to it
5199590 sadly the decoupling thesis has little support in theory or in practice
5199591 gdp growth is easing in a number of european economies as highlighted by national accounts figures out during the week the flash second quarter gdp data for the euro zone noted a 0 2 q q contraction following a 0 7 expansion in the first three months of the year this was primarily the result of a 0 5 downturn in the regions largest economy germany and a 0 3 contraction in second biggest france
5199592 preliminary data suggest the italian economy also contracted 0 3 during the quarter the netherlands reported no growth and spain grew at its slowest pace since the 1993 recession with a minimal 0 1 expansion the spanish government fears recession in the second half of the year and called for emergency discussions on thursday to deal with the situation latvia and estonia also contracted in the second quarter with estonia reporting a technical recession after also shrinking in the first three months of the year while no flash estimate is available for ireland the economy is on the brink of recession
5199593 youll miss a lot of action waiting for gdp to go negative more to the point if youre waiting as an investor for gdp to actually turn negative youre going to miss a lot of action along the way i think the best example is to just go back to japan they had a real estate bubble that turned bust and they had their own credit contraction back in the early 1990s guess what japan didnt post its first back to back contraction of real gdp until the second half of 1993 by the time the back to back negative that people seem to be waiting for happened the nikkei had already plunged 50 the 10 year jgb yield rallied 300 basis points and the bank of japan had cut the overnight rate 500 basis points which said a thing or two about the efficacy of using the traditional monetary policy response of cutting interest rates into a credit contraction as were now finding out here in the us
5199594 the point is we cant make the assumption that weve avoided a recessionary condition in the economy just because we have so far managed to avoid back to back quarters of negative gdp
5199595 the nber relies on four different variables the first is employment now ive told you before employment is down seven months in a row does employment go in the gdp the answer is no is it correlated yes does it help grow the business cycle of course
5199596 the next variable is industrial production does that go into gdp the answer is no does it help grow the business cycle the answer is yes this is a number that comes from the fed the gdp comes from the commerce department its a very important variable
5199597 the next variable the third one is real personal income excluding government transfers
5199598 the fourth variable and the only variable that actually feeds into gdp is real sales activity in manufacturing retail and wholesale sectors
5199599 this recession wont end before mid 2009 in our view now im just giving you the rearview mirror whats most important to you folks is lets look through the front window and see when this recession is going to end the tea leaves that im reading at this point in time show that this recession is not ending any time before the mid part of 2009 which would mean that if youre looking for not the mary ann bartels intermediate bottoms but the fundamental bottom i dont think you can expect to see it before february or march of next year if im correct on when this recession ends historically the s amp p 500 troughs four months before the economy actually hits its bottom point

5199665 thank you mr president helen thomas at the white house
5199666 it was hard to convince helen to make this documentary
5199667 but when we found the talented rory kennedy we had made a match sort of a match made in heaven
5199668 it was in like 1960 and thomas was covering jackie and the family primarily and she wasnt covering my uncle yet
5199669 and so her editor called her at 3 a m and said you know we just got this news that carolines hamster died and she said you have to call white house press secretary pierre salinger right now and find out if this is true and so thomas didnt even think about it
5199670 she picked up the phone and she called pierre salinger and she said is it true is it true caroline kennedys hamster died and pierre salinger was like helen its 3 oclock in the morning are you insane youre calling me about this stupid hamster and you know she heard about that for a good long time
5199671 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5199672 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5199673 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5199674 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5199675 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5199676 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5199677 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5199678 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5199679 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5199680 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5199681 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5199682 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5199683 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5199684 i am a competitor i always want to compete and always want to be out there with my team its been hard its been very difficult and it has definitely been a trial for me
5199685 i am not concerned and i wont be even until game week he will be ready to play hes a competitor and he knows exactly what to do and i trust him so im not worried
5199686 if i had to go out there and play today i think i could play i mean i would hurt a bit after but the doctors and our trainer kevin morris have done a tremendous job of keeping me patient and keeping me grounded and letting me know that everything is going to be alright
5199687 ive only been out two weeks i dont think it will be that hard to get back into it
5199688 dear kent like you i also am curious about lots of things for

5199817 the mb has repeatedly denied it has any representation in the u
5199818 there are however ideological similarities between the mb and most of above mentioned islamic organizations for the fact that these ideologies represent mainstream moderate islamic thinking
5199819 ties between the mb and any of the u s based organizations were extensively scrutinized during the holy land foundation trial

5199822 the so called global network of the muslim brotherhood is merely a hollywood fiction that only exists in the minds of those who created it as part of their scare tactics to insight fears among the public and instigate government hostilities
5199823 the original egyptian organization has spawned branches in 70 countries
5199824 there are entities that exist in many countries all over the world these entities have the same ideology principle and objectives but they work in different circumstances and different contexts so it is reasonable to have decentralization in action so that every entity works according to its circumstances and according to the problems it is facing and in their framework

5199826 we accidentally were thrown in here together so well better stick it out
5199827 syria is the only country hosting iraqi refugees in the region that has agreed to conduct such examination on its territory
5199828 this initiative is very demanding both in terms of logistics and workforce but it is our duty to iraqi children as it has been our duty to open our schools to any iraqi child wishing to follow the syrian curriculum
5199829 there were six iraqi students in our class and all dropped out except one the only student whod been in syria for over a year and had already attended a syrian school the previous year
5199830 in iraq we would have had a day in between each exam to rest but here we had seven exams in seven days that was hard
5199831 this is the future i want to make sure my son continues his education like his older brother and the rest of our family
5199832 i would have been prepared to go back to iraq to make sure he passed those exams
5199833 these exams are essential in ensuring refugee iraqi childrens academic efforts are encouraged and adequately validated plus its a fantastic stepping stone for further education in iraq in syria or in other good universities across the world
