8220051 its not about me its about the future of the country do the right thing vote for the democrat
8220052 its very dangerous there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia in particular crimea ukraine and moldova
8220053 while russia sent aid to flood hit ukrainian regions ukraine failed to help russia to force georgia to peace and took an openly hostile stance
8220054 moscow has acted brutally in georgia but when the united states and britain backed the independence of kosovo without un approval they paved the way for russias defence of south ossetia and for the current western humiliation
8220055 what is sauce for the kosovo goose is sauce for the south ossetian gander
8220056 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8220057 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves
8220058 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8220059 we will take action to ensure people have the opportunities information and incentives towards healthy living
8220060 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8220061 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8220062 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly
8220063 there is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue by being almost a form of regulation by proxy and would lack credibility
8220064 james brown is an excellent player i think he could play at the highest level theres no doubt about it
8220065 somebody has obviously got to take a chance on him but he is a fantastic player left right foot can score with both feet great in the air works ever so hard and brings other people into play there is not much more you want from a young player
8220066 if he can get a chance and start training and playing with the best in the country and play in the premier league you are going to bring even more out of him
8220067 obviously the gaffer had it right i know a lot of people were humming and haaing whether james should have played out wide last year or up front but obviously it has worked
8220068 he is hungry now and he looks like he is enjoying it up front whereas after the injury maybe he wasnt as hungry as he is now
8220069 i think the gaffer has done the right thing and it is a bonus for james hes relishing it
8220070 there were a lot of circumstances why i didnt go home thats the way football is sometimes
8220071 contracts are funny things and i was told i had to stay for another year so i am here for another year
8220072 i did my pre season and i have been given a chance to play by the gaffer i am here to give 100 per cent now and i am committed to the club got another year and we will just see what happens after that
8220073 shaun is a terrific player who has great ability at aston villa it was difficult when he wasnt playing
8220074 i saw him on saturday when he played for 70 minutes and i thought he was outstanding he looked lively and bright
8220075 i spoke to shaun and he felt with a couple of games under his belt that he would be back to 100 so i had no hesitation in calling him up
8220076 he has started the season well and he gives us a different dimension and he is in good goalscoring form
8220077 alan has progressed in the last few years into a top class international full back some people would say one of the best full backs in britain
8220078 its very disappointing but we were aware of his injury pre season we kept our fingers crossed that he would be available for the start of the campaign
8220079 had it passed it would have restricted large new mines from releasing toxic pollutants into water that
8220080 we are thrilled that alaskan voters have spoken and they have made it clear that mining is part of our history in the state and part of our future
8220081 god tells us what he has made us to be and will yet make of us to hear and obey is only obvious
8220082 and what im commanding you to do is love one another
8220083 were on the edge of our seat like everybody else
8220084 im just so thankful for her support and her familys support as well
8220085 were confident about the numbers but obviously this race is just too close to call
8220086 im still leaning on incumbents i think the incumbents have brought in a lot of money and im not sure about the new people
8220087 theres a cloud out there itll go away but it has to take time alaskans trust me thats what this vote says ive trusted them and they trust me
8220088 this is not that tough this is still a republican state you think theyre going to go for obama you think theyre going to go with sen charles schumer whos against drilling in the arctic and offshore theyre voting against any kind of development in alaksa if you want to send the mayor down to join them thats not alaska thats not the alaska i know i believe alaskans know better
8220089 everybodys got a few mistakes in their past but i havent seen anything that hes done that would make me want to vote for somebody else
8220090 begich kind of seems to be in the middle and he goes for anwr and i just typically tend to vote more that way people that kind of dont follow one way or the other
8220091 i want people walking into voting booths voting for something
8220092 i want them to vote for something and were going to give them something to vote for
8220093 ive always said don youngs done good things for alaska its a question of whos going to be there for the future and its a question of whos going to be effective not just today but five years from now and ten years from now
8220094 i think alaska needs someone who can fight for alaskas interest i think i could be a much more effective fighter than sean parnell could be
8220095 ill be looking for a job if i dont have this one
8220096 it doesnt just raise the bar it bends it in half and ties it in a knot
8220097 theres little difference between winning and losing except that one feels better after winning
8220098 he has been killed police have recovered his body and are trying to bring it down from the top of the mountain
8220099 its the worst thing that could possibly happen its what we hoped would never happen

8220107 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas
8220108 but for companies to harness the power of the cloud it should enhance the alignment driven by enterprise architecture driving down the lead times for delivering it value to business from concept to deployment and through maintenance
8220109 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
8220110 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this

8220207 my vision is a bayreuth of the 21st century a new artistic spirit
8220208 we are not traditionalists even though we have lots of respect for tradition
8220209 we think wagner was a composer of the future and we always respect this spirit
8220210 on the contrary it could reinforce the international stature of city opera
8220211 it is reasonable to assume that the foundation will look at both concepts and will decide for the most convincing one
8220212 i think that wieland wagners offspring should never have been excluded or other offspring
8220213 the family consists of more tribes than just wolfgang wagners tribe
8220214 im concerned about how will bayreuth continue in the future and im engaged in this problem and i want the best possible leadership this has priority and then come the tribe and the wagner business
8220215 ive followed him all the way through his artistic activities
8220216 i admire his work very much intellectually our minds are very similar

8220220 you know i spent 20 years in business if you ran a company whose only strategy was to tear down the competition it wouldnt last long so why is this wisdom so hard to find in washington i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or d next to it because this election isnt about liberal versus conservative its not about left versus right its about the future versus the past in this election at this moment in our history we know what the problems are we know that at this critical juncture we have only one shot to get it right let me tell you about a place called lebanon lebanon virginia

8220267 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8220289 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
8220290 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
8220291 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
8220292 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
8220293 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8220294 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8220295 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8220313 es cierto que el indio defiende su suelo pero lo defiende porque odia la civilizaci n odia la ley el sacerdocio la ense anza la patria que l defiende es la de su libre y sanguinaria holgazaner a no la santa patria del coraz n herencia de sus mayores es una cosa probada que el indio no sabe nada de ese tan ponderado hero smo de sus abuelos que nosotros por moda les atribuimos a buen seguro que ni melin ni kilapan han visto jam s un ejemplar de la araucana ni saben quienes fueron rengo y galvarino

8220322 its fair to say we predicted more drama from a track lined with concrete walls and had factored the appearance of at least one safety car period into our pre race calculations
8220323 i dont know whether thats down to us misinterpreting the level of risk involved in racing around this track or whether it was just a testament to the good driving standards of modern formula 1 drivers nonetheless we came away from valencia having made gains in both championships which was very encouraging
8220324 at 8am on saturday i received a phone call from the teams doctor aki hintsa telling me that lewis was in some difficulties hed woken up with a severe migraine and with his neck in spasm
8220325 as a precaution we readied pedro to take over but despite delaying his start to saturday practice lewis was able to continue with his full race programme his physical problems are unlikely to disturb his fitness programme and we expect him to make a full recovery for both the monza test and next weeks belgian gp
8220326 lewis felt a lot better on sunday but was still slightly sore and tender we are delighted he was able to sustain the performance of a full race in hot conditions we did not have the package to beat felipe massa but we feel we did a first rate job and secured a very useful haul of world championship points lewis extended his lead in the drivers championship and in the constructors we extended our lead over bmw sauber and closed down the gap to ferrari
8220327 most definitely the reality is that heikkis particularly strong when hes got the car in front in his sights when he homes in on another competitor then his natural competitive instincts really come alive heikkis much more adept at switching effortlessly between engine saving brake saving and tyre saving modes and knows exactly when to push so the situation he encountered at the start of the year when he was dealing with slightly more tyre degradation is no longer a concern

8220350 we are committed to building a sustainable business in the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle to integrate components of uranium production and services infrastructure operations and markets
8220351 our goal is to strategically collaborate with mutually aligned industry participants to identify market needs and invest in both existing and emerging opportunities in the nuclear fuel sector
8220352 nuclear energy is gaining more focused interest as the result of a structural need tied to increased fossil fuel costs and carbon emissions standards impacting other forms of power generation
8220353 the combination of experience collectively held by first reserve and the accord management team will enable accord to capitalize on synergies in the nuclear sector not yet realized due to a historical lack of capital and resource commitment to the industry with significant resources in place accord offers the market a new alternative to sourcing material and services within the nuclear fuel cycle

8220366 the ohio air force lab proposed that a bomb be developed that contained a chemical that would cause enemy soliders to become gay and to have their units break down because all their soldiers became irresistably attractive to one another
8220367 the notion was that a chemical that would probably be pleasant in the human body in low quantities could be identified and by virtue of either breathing or having their skin exposed to this chemical the notion was that soliders would become gay

8220421 i was a little skeptical about the subject the fly i said well how is it going to be reading for an opera but it just takes somebody that has the experience of composer howard shore to write the music and he has done a score that goes fabulously well with the story
8220422 working with two great artists like placido domingo and david cronenberg its just been a fantastic experience

8220437 the more annoying thing for me was that she came back and won the olympic games
8220438 i dont think anyone should be allowed back regardless i still would only have come sixth but the girls a few down the line would have got a medal i was hoping anyone would beat her
8220439 people should be banned for life if they take drugs simple as that two years is not long enough i am sure you must still have it in your system and you must still have benefits
8220440 its really frustrating when you train really hard i didnt give my best today but if i was the girl in fourth place i would be really angry right now you train really hard you put everything in you make sacrifices in everything
8220441 this athlete has tested positive her b sample will be opened later and there will be a hearing
8220442 we live in a society where people cheat doping is never in the past we cant lower our guard
8220443 that is all in the past i made a mistake but i returned
8220444 those who say i should be banned should look in the mirror
8220445 that makes it bittersweet id have been really upset if shed won gold the penalty you should pay if you take drugs is not to compete at the olympics

8220449 an abnormal brain scan of the athlete showed signs of a tumor
8220450 he cant take stuff like that because he has acromegaly

8220457 as far as nick diaz hes not the no 1 contender out there
8220458 to elitexc he is hes the number one for getting eyeballs to watch them theyre pushing on eyeballs versus a career move for a champion like kj kj is really not the one who gets anything out of the fight diaz does and so does proelite
8220459 i would think eddie alvarez is the no 1 contender
8220460 hes definitely ranked higher than nick diaz kj already beat nick diaz
8220461 eddie alvarez is getting married but thats not our problem
8220462 but theres nothing in it for kj unless elitexc finally wakes up a little bit thats why well have a press conference i dont like to talk and beat a company thats already beat down im going to give them the benefit of the doubt hopefully theyll see the light

8220479 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8220480 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8220481 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly

8220612 chinas trade surplus might come down significantly if the government is serious about rebalancing the economy and it is something that we would like to see
8220613 for those who said yuan appreciation wont help adjust the trade balance the changes in u s china trade dynamics are proving them wrong
8220614 the government may continue to come up with measures to try to soften the blow

8220650 kimi is a fierce competitor a highly talented racing driver and i wouldnt levy any criticism at him at all
8220651 the bottom line is drivers have good and bad races and im sure he will forget this one but he is more than capable of winning so i certainly wouldnt discount him at this stage with only six races to go i wouldnt want to make any predictions about him thats the worst thing we could do
8220652 he has exceeded many peoples expectation in terms of his reliability and i think that for sure we know kimi better and he is a formidable competitor and he will be scratching his head this isnt a highly technical circuit youve got to be good on the brakes and i think kimi will bounce back strong in spa

8220670 if president bush does what no world leader has ever done before fully protect these colossal areas of shallow and deep coral reefs seamounts and other vulnerable marine ecosystems in the pacific ocean now and forever
8220671 two years ago president bush shook the world when he made the northwestern hawaiian islands a marine national monument and what was then the worlds largest no take marine reserve
8220672 he gifted americans and the world by protecting life in an incredible area of ocean 1 200 miles long and 100 miles wide
8220673 if the president ultimately acts to protect these amazing areas of ocean to the fullest extent
8220674 his conservation legacy will rival that of president teddy roosevelt leadership in protecting our planet can and must come from republicans and democrats alike
8220675 the fate of our oceans is far more important than partisan politics
8220676 by using his presidential powers under the antiquities act and other statutes to fully protect ocean areas like he did in hawaii president bush could write a new chapter in the history of conservation
8220677 this could be the best thing ever for ocean conservation these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
8220678 indeed theyre bigger than mexico countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere if the president gives full protection to these areas i am thrilled that president bush is considering this

8220749 the philippine government has been very tender in treating the separatist rebels during the term of president fidel ramos the rebels were given space and time to form themselves and stretch their arms
8220750 the former president joseph estrada in his all out war policy campaign almost wiped the rebels away the present arroyo government gave them the chance to regroup and strengthen their position kaya ngayon bigla silang lumakas at tingnan natin gusto pa nilang makipag separate sa gobyerno
8220751 i believe that president arroyo gave back the lost camp abubakar the milf central headquarters through the advice of ex president fidel ramos and through the intervention of the organization of islamic conference oic again the milf gained indonesia and malaysia to be on their side in the negotiating table

8220814 we predicted 2008 would be a pivotal year for the mobile web in the us and our data is backing that up clearly the rate of growth and acceleration is getting faster in the us and around the world
8220815 i say frankly on a private level that i always intend to stay true to these statements i do always say what i actually feel at that time after each metal gear when i say i am going to move on to the next project but its like when hayao miyazaki says he is not going to do more and then always ends up doing it i think i am kind of in a similar situation i have ideas other than metal gear and i want to go on to make other new games but for political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return but i have to say my feeling hasnt changed i would like to pass on the metal gear series to younger staff members and then go on to produce the title and not be so attached to it
8220816 i always want to be in a creative position where i can concentrate and grow as a creator i feel if i dont do that i might as well not be in the industry but on the other hand i am looking after and responsible for the business side of konami as a whole as well as for kojima productions and it would be ridiculous for me on the business side to say i will just bring out a game every four years therefore i would like to keep doing what i do but at the same time pass my own ideas to the staff who can take over and produce thats what i have been doing and i would like to keep doing it this way and in my spare time i want to establish a new game which i have been wanting to do for a long time i do have strong urges to create a new title other than the metal gear series as a businessperson i might worry whether it will sell more than the metal gear series but thats another issue but when i said its a difficult question to answer i mean that when we look ten years into the future maybe yes i may well end up spending more time on the metal gear series
8220817 gameplay is always fundamental halo bioshock i see their approach and i think they are brilliant in some ways but i still feel they still lack a kind of a deeper storyline or the expression of the feelings of the characters i do have plans of how i should approach this and get around it in mgs4 yes i put everything in the cut sequences which i kind of regret to some extent because maybe there is a new approach which i should think about im always thinking about it making it interactive but at the same time telling the story part and the drama even more emotionally i would like to take that approach which i am still working on storytelling is very difficult but adding the flavor helps to relay the storytelling meaning in a cutscene with a set camera and effects you can make the users feel sorrow or make them happy or laugh this is an easy approach which we have been doing that is one point the second point is that if i make multiple storylines and allow the users to select which story this might really sacrifice the deep emotion the user might feel when theres a concrete storyline and you kind of go along that rail you feel the destiny of the story which at the end makes you feel more moved but when you make it interactive if you want multiple stories where you go one way or another will that make the player more moved when he or she finishes the game these two points are really the key which i am thinking about and if this works i think i could probably introduce a more interactive storytelling method

8220821 kettens gen wilhelm l sst sich heute als weltnaturerbe dietzel feiern obwohl er noch vor einigen jahren wertvolle alte buchen im gebiet des heutigen nationalparks kellerwald hat einschlagen lassen
8220822 als eine der ersten amtshandlungen hatte der f r den naturschutz zust ndige minister dietzel vor neun jahren zu verantworten dass alte buchen im kellerwald eingeschlagen wurden in einer nacht und nebel aktion wurden circa 200 ber 120 jahre alte buchen gef llt um die bilanz von hessen forst aufzubessern erst der druck von uns gr nen der umweltverb nde und der ffentlichkeit konnten ihn damals davon abhalten ein zweites mal einschlagen zu lassen
8220823 wir gr ne begr en dass es inzwischen den von uns schon immer geforderten nationalpark in hessen gibt dass sich dietzel heute f r ein weltnaturerbe kellerwald einsetzen kann ist aber nicht dank der cdu regierung sondern trotz der cdu regierung erm glicht worden

8220825 um dieses ziel zu erreichen m ssen wir den stromnetzausbau f r mensch und natur vertr glich gestalten und gleichzeitig beschleunigen beides gelingt durch eine gr tm gliche unterirdische verlegung von h chstspannungsleitungen wie sie in unserem gesetzentwurf in der n he von wohngebieten und natur und landschaftsschutzgebieten vorgesehen ist
8220826 der im juni von der bundesregierung vorgelegte entwurf f r ein bundeseinheitliches energieleitungsausbaugesetz wurde bislang noch nicht in den bundestag eingebracht auch deshalb steht v llig in den sternen ob es jemals eine bundeseinheitliche l sung geben wird die regelungen auf landesebene obsolet machen wird inhaltlich bleibt der vorschlag aus berlin weit hinter unseren vorstellungen zur ck was mindestabst nde von freileitungen zu wohngebieten den erhalt von kulturdenkm lern und schutzgebieten sowie die zahl der unter das gesetz fallenden projekte angeht
8220827 wir schlagen deshalb ein vorgehen vor bei dem wir unseren landesgesetzentwurf hier weiter vorantreiben und gleichzeitig die gesch ftsf hrende landesregierung dazu auffordern auf bundesebene sollte der dortige entwurf jemals in das gesetzgebungsverfahren kommen die vorstellungen des hessischen landtags mit vehemenz zu vertreten durch ein solches vorgehen k nnen die sorgen der b rgerinnen und b rger vor m glicherweise gesundheitsgef hrdenden elektromagnetischen strahlen bestm glich ber cksichtigt werden auch der bestm gliche schutz von natur und landschaft wird so gew hrleistet und um diesen schutz von mensch tier und natur geht es uns vor allem

8220848 theres not tens of millions but if as a club we feel something is right then were in a position to do that
8220849 the manner in which we made the changes did not affect the way we approached the game and played the game

8221011 de endowments van yale en harvard lieten dit jaar een verlies van ongeveer 5 procent optekenen
8221012 sinds 1985 kenden de twee instituten nochtans zo goed als geen verliezen harvard heeft slechts n verliesjaar gekend in 1988 werd een negatief resultaat van 0 2 procent geboekt yale leed in 2001 en 2002 een respectievelijk verlies van 2 70 procent en 0 50 procent door de huidige crisis is het echter moeilijk om geen verlies te maken het gaat erom het verlies zo klein mogelijk te houden
8221013 patient safety is always our paramount concern and so we have immediately responded to the recommendation of the idmc we are currently notifying all participating clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies that enrollment of new patients into vital 2 has been suspended as has treatment with gvax immunotherapy for prostate cancer of patients enrolled in the study
8221014 notwithstanding this disappointing outcome we would like to acknowledge the courage and commitment of the patients and physicians who have participated in this trial
8221015 the observation in the vital 2 trial is very surprising to us and we have therefore asked the idmc to conduct a previously unplanned futility analysis of vital 1 in order to determine the overall prospects for our ongoing development program for this product moreover with the cessation of vital 2 we expect to make commensurate adjustments to our business operations and we will provide further details regarding this in the near future as a reminder the company ended the second quarter of 2008 with 166 million in cash

8221031 the bliss studies are the largest double blinded clinical trials ever conducted in lupus
8221032 there is a significant need for new and more effective treatments for these patients and we look forward to having the belimumab phase 3 results available in 2009
8221033 the belimumab clinical investigators have done a tremendous job in completing the randomization and initial dosing of bliss 52 and bliss 76 on our original timeline despite the size and complexity of these studies
8221034 they have enrolled nearly 1700 patients worldwide into these phase 3 trials we are one step closer to results that we hope will confirm belimumabs potential to offer a significant new treatment option for patients with sle

8221072 thats a really personal song i wrote not long ago when i was going through a lot of stuff
8221073 i had a situation where there was another woman who i felt was getting the things i wanted it almost scared me to put it on the record it was so personal and introspective but my fans deserve that from me so i just need to go for it
8221074 i felt it so much in the studio and you can hear it in my voice
8221075 this is the first time ive let myself be that vulnerable im usually the girl who wont take any crap but thats not realistic all the time
8221076 i think breast implants are awful so many of my friends have had them and theyve gone wrong one of my friends had one that sort of moved up to her shoulder im not into them
8221077 if i got saggy like the sacks some women have after they have children id have them done im not against them
8221078 i was never anorexic but i remember thinking i dont want to be this skinny
8221079 when i was doing shows and flying economy nobody ever fed me or id be staying in hotels so cheap that by the time id get in there wasnt any room service
8221080 i didnt eat for a long time youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
8221081 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8221082 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8221083 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go

8221086 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8221087 i still cannot believe this happened we were only a few minutes late because a rides queue hadnt been moving and then the ride lasted longer than we thought
8221088 we ran back to the bus zone as quickly as we could but we were seven minutes late at first i wasnt worried because the bus driver had said he would wait 10 extra minutes but soon i realised he had gone and left us
8221089 who leaves a bunch of kids in an unfamiliar area
8221090 alton towers is based in the middle of nowhere on a dark country road anything could have happened
8221091 the kids shouldnt have been late but if the coach company is willing to take teenagers on trips they should be prepared to give them a bit of leeway especially when youre only talking seven minutes
8221092 youd think in this day and age that people would look after the younger people in the community
8221093 there are strict policies that the bus driver has to follow so he had to leave them
8221094 the driver needed to get back up to carlisle before his driving hours were used up there are tight working regulations for drivers so we have to keep to a strict schedule the driver waited for five minutes before setting off
8221095 it was the drivers first day doing those sorts of trips usually the drivers should say be back for 5 15pm so they can leave at 5 30pm
8221096 we didnt know he was that young but even so he isnt too young to get back on time

8221104 southwark council is committed to tackling benefit fraud every penny that gets cheated from housing or council tax benefit is another penny we cant spend on vital services
8221105 its not a case of stealing from some anonymous big brother they are stealing from you and me and those that require our services
8221106 the government has in effect reduced the councils budget over three years by 30m it is essential that we save every penny and use the funds we have in the best possible way to make sure we continue with our plans to improve southwark
8221107 catching and prosecuting benefit cheats is one of our top priorities and we will continue to bring to justice those who break the law

8221122 leslie morrison came back to his native northern ireland in 2002 following a long and successful career in north america and the far east
8221123 he has led invest ni from its formation and has played a pivotal role in its many successes
8221124 these include major investments by locally owned companies and international investors
8221125 after seven years as part of the invest ni team i believe that it is appropriate for a new chief executive to take invest ni forward and build on the agencys significant successes to date
8221126 invest ni has supported the growth and development of companies across northern ireland securing some of the highest levels of inward investment in europe whilst delivering support to smaller indigenous companies that have increased their productivity and export capability
8221127 it is largely due to leslies creative leadership and commitment that invest ni has evolved into what is now one of the most successful economic development agencies in the uk
8221128 we have been starved of success i suppose the only chance that we would have of getting a trophy over the next few years would be trying to do well in the carling cup or the fa cup
8221129 we have seen clubs over the last one or two years portsmouth have done it in the fa cup tottenham won it last year so you have got to believe a good cup run and a bit of luck in a couple of draws and youve got a chance
8221130 the current economic climate presents a challenge to all media companies throughout the world
8221131 it also presents opportunities not least the potential for joint ventures shared investments mergers and divestments which may change perceptions of the structure and nature of media
8221132 the pattern of these unusual structural opportunities will we believe be of benefit to shareholders and bring renewed confidence back to the sector as the global economy goes through its present recessionary period
8221133 while it is difficult to forecast advertising revenues reliably for the second half as we have only experienced the two traditionally quiet summer months trading in the next three months leading up to christmas will be critical in determining the full year result
8221134 however as second half comparators are easier and assuming a continuation of the first half advertising trends inm believes that it will achieve profits in line with consensus forecasts for the full year
8221135 im excited to get back out there and see some familiar faces as well as meet some new ones

8221144 this is not the end of our campaign this is only the beginning
8221145 when china was awarded the olympics protest was inevitable what were doing today is standing in solidarity with tibetans inside tibet
8221146 thousands remain detained and missing following chinas violent and brutal crackdown against tibetans who risked everything taking to the streets to speak out for human rights freedom and justice
8221147 while we know that the chinese authorities are likely to step up their attacks on tibetans in the coming months as the olympic spotlight fades we also know that change only comes when people stand up and demand it the historic protests that have taken place in beijing in tibet and around the world this olympic year have ensured that tibet is recognized as an issue of global significance that demands immediate attention from the chinese leadership and governments around the world

8221156 he is a little bit nervous mainly because he came in with a touch of cat flu and didnt much like taking his medicine
8221157 he is however a very handsome fellow with a lovely coat
8221158 she is friendly and playful she came in with a fur missing from her neck and legs due to some sort of allergy but is now on the mend she will make a lovely little pet
8221159 she too had a bad case of cat flu from which she has now recovered
8221160 due to her illness she had been a bit lazy but she is now tormenting her little friends and chasing them all over the place
8221161 she will also try to snaffle food when youre not watching so she is certainly back to full health
8221162 an attempt to redress the perceived lack of adequately qualified consultancy professionals for this new market
8221163 the qualification has allowed me to learn new ways of analysing companies people and their processes ultimately improving the service sans souci can offer clients
8221164 tenants should be extra vigilant as bogus callers are on the increase and theft is usually their aim these bogus callers will frequently claim to be from a public body such as the housing executive or water service

8221168 the best kept bonfire competition seeks to promote better environmental awareness and public safety at the july 11 bonfires in our borough
8221169 this summer i saw the improvements for myself and consider that the standard of bonfires in north down is better than ever that is good news for everyone
8221170 seeking to recognise the hard work undertaken by all those managing established bonfire sites in north down
8221171 it gives me great pleasure to be able to mark this momentous occasion locally by raising the london 2012 flag in the borough
8221172 northern ireland and the united kingdom generally have produced some outstanding olympic competitors over the years and i hope that the country and perhaps even the borough will be suitably represented at the 2012 games
8221173 we are very proud to be part of this auspicious and historic occasion and wish everyone every success for 2012
8221174 i was impressed by the level of support the ni cancer fund for children provides for children diagnosed with cancer and their families
8221175 the residential based initiative will provide emotional and social support to these children when they need it most
8221176 we all work in the it industry and had simply used our interest in cycling as an opportunity to keep fit and keep in touch with others from the industry raising money for charity gave the group an added incentive to get on our bikes
8221177 we are delighted that sicling org selected us as their chosen beneficiary this year two families each week are given the devastating news that their child has cancer and the nicfc aims to help these children and their families to regain control of their lives
8221178 i am deeply angered and disappointed by news that the housing executive have decided to put land for sale at churchill park in ballyholme
8221179 this is an area which already has a large number of houses and the sale of this land would leave this proposed development totally surrounded by existing housing
8221180 the one piece of green space in the churchill area
8221181 what has particularly annoyed residents is the high handed and almost secretive manner in which this sale has been handled
8221182 no resident has been notified and the first that people knew about this was when the for sale sign went up on the green they have not even been told under what conditions if any this land is being sold off i share residents concerns and am seeking an urgent meeting with the housing executive to discuss this face to face
8221183 the housing executive continually reviews its sites of undeveloped land to identify their potential future use for social housing
8221184 the housing executive has deemed this particular site to be unsuitable for social housing and has declared it surplus to requirements under land and property services therefore we are required to offer the land for sale
8221185 any purchaser would need to ensure that all necessary planning approvals could be obtained for potential development of the site this would involve consultation where local residents would have the opportunity to comment on any proposals
8221186 we were overcome and really delighted with the huge number of nominations received as well as the exceptionally high standard of nominees
8221187 everyone who received a nomination should be very pleased and those who have made it onto the shortlists should realise what a huge vote of confidence it is as all the nominations were made by clients peers and even fans
8221188 thats it and i dont know if i want to buy it or not its priced pretty high
8221189 there are lots of people who have been waiting for 2 years for this and they are going to put down the money but the numbers are clearly not going to be anywhere near what we could excepted it simply because not just because of the price itself but because

8221226 that s a reference to our current president who i very publicly despise
8221227 i just cant stand the guy or his administration and it was about him going to the graveside of martin luther king one of my heroes and i think desecrating the memory of that great man and his work by being there during the iraq war i found it pathetic so i wrote that song about it
8221228 you want an exceptional american yeah and i think hes probably an exceptional person you look at the way hes put his campaign together and the way he responds to many of the criticisms that are already being lobbed at him either from the clinton family he beat hillary clinton to the nomination or from the mccains
8221229 yes i think hes going to make it and it will be a better day for all of us
8221230 this is a victory for the people and its great to be back
8221231 i told my teenage daughter not to look up at the banners

8221252 very challenging markets in the uk us and spain have resulted in a sharp fall in profits as expected pbt per tax profit of 4 3 million was below our expectation of 53 5m uk margins fell to 5 5 per cent on volumes of 6 317 units us margins fell to 4 8 per cent on volumes of 2 094 group performed worse than we were expecting in the uk
8221253 management confirmed strong execution on its backlog of profits and confirmed its guidance of 9 10 per cent net profit margins for the engineering amp construction division
8221254 while questions were asked about the lack of margin improvement relative to petrofacs competitors these are sector leading margins for turnkey contractors and continued delivery at these levels is more than good enough for us management also pointed out a bidding pipeline in 2009 which is even better than this year
8221255 third quarter data from etis unique subsidiary which accounts for 46 per cent of its pubs shows a marked deterioration net income from beer sales fell by 8 4 per cent in the quarter this is in contrast with etis robust performance in the first half when ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation was held flat we had taken this as reassurance that eti was outperforming the weak on trade beer market but the third quarter data and trading update from july suggest otherwise we have therefore reduced our 2009 forecasts by 9 per cent to reflect the ongoing weakness in the beer market and consequent pressure on licensees
8221256 from a balance sheet perspective in order to enable enterprise to convert to a reit real estate investment trust we believe that it will have to accelerate the pace of asset disposals or tap its securitisation if not there is a potential for cash to become trapped in its securitisation in 2011 we do not share the view that it is inevitable that eti will breach covenants but its free cash generation is finely balanced with the cash outflows required by the reit regime
8221257 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes everybody needs to work like everybody else and everybody needs to prove he deserves to play

8221259 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8221260 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future

8221296 you wanted to know about it right and its something to talk about until the sila vatra show up
8221297 sure why not not like theres anything else to do
8221298 many years ago just after the beginning of the war when the air nomads had been wiped out by sozins comet the world was in disarray many people panicked others did nothing in their ignorance convinced that they would never fall prey to the fire nation my great grandfather takutta was one of these people
8221299 takutta lived in the northern water tribe but had come to the south pole to trade furs and to visit his kin with him he brought his beautiful wife nori they stayed for many weeks but did not heed the tales of the fire nations cruelty they thought that they were safe behind their icy walls
8221300 but one day the fire nation came there was a raid despite their numbers my tribe was quickly overpowered and slowly the great ice city began to fall to ruin takutta and his wife nori had taken refuge at the southern side of the city for neither of them were benders there was a small alcove behind the city walls and for two days it provided them protection and shelter but when the city finally fell and the clans dispersed there was nothing else that they could do they launched one final attack a great shattering blow tore the city apart the cave split open and collapsed leaving my great grandfather on a single floating raft of ice my great grandmother nori screamed and pleaded as the final survivors from the raid tried to carry her away to safety there was nothing anyone could do as my great grandfather floated away out to sea before the remaining water tribe warriors carried nori away into the intricate tunnels built underneath the city to escape my takutta managed to yell to her before he floated out of sight the water tribesmen heard him cry out ill follow you home nori ill follow you home
8221301 for days takutta drifted out into the ocean on the raft of ice he grew tired and hungry unable to hunt without his spear and unable to drink the potent water from the sea stricken from hunger and grief he fell into a deep slumber if it werent for the warmer air currents away from the mainland it was likely that he would have died from hypothermia but one day a great shuddering woke him he had drifted back to the mainland and caught up against a glacier my great grandfather didnt know where he was or how far away from the city but he made his way slowly back towards the city and to his love living off melted ice and burying himself in snow to keep out the cold he used the stars to navigate himself back to the southern water tribe city but when he got there he found nothing everyone he had ever known or loved in the southern tribe had either been captured killed or had escaped
8221302 they say he wept for three days swallowed entirely by his grief he cursed the gods for bringing such shame upon him and cursing himself for being so blind but he regained his courage and stole through the now empty city looking for food when it dusk ended and the moon hung in the sky my grandfather found his way into the palace but he found something that he had not expected an enormous crack in the ice spreading from one end of the palace to the other where the fire nation had launched its final killing blow they had split the palace in half
8221303 late into the night as my grandfather was organising his final provisions to leave the city the sky lit up above him he could see an infinite light with a sparkling tail it hurtled towards the centre of the palace faster and faster when it drove into the ice the entire structure shook and cracked but takutta was unharmed and he ran to see what had caused such colossal damage he reached the centre of the abandoned palace where the dark crack ran he could see that the blazing object in the sky had hurtled into the crack much of the ice was melting from the heat and the edges of the palace walls were black with soot when he looked into the great chasm he could see something at the very bottom glistening and sparkling his curiosity overcame his fear and he began to make the descent down and into the crack it was a long and treacherous climb but when he reached the bottom my grandfather saw something that no other eyes had seen before
8221304 what my grandfather saw was black ice it sparkled and gleamed at the bottom of the chasm a great circle embedded into the rest of the normal blue ice he saw that the object that had shaken the palace so roughly was in fact a meteorite it was lodged into the depths of the ice too far for takutta to reach but in its path it had left a brilliant trail of the most blackened glistening ice for almost an entire day and night my grandfather worked at the ice picking away at the surrounding desperate to dislodge the black ice when finally he did he found that it was the most intriguing thing he had ever seen it was exactly like ice in almost every way but takutta found that the ice was as warm as skin and no matter how hard he tried he could not break it
8221305 so he climbed back up through the chasm to the palace when he emerged he saw that it was a full moon suddenly takutta was filled with an almighty determination he claimed that he had seen the gods in the stars and that they had given him a message he would return to the northern water tribe he would travel to the other side of the world and he would find my great grandmother he worked for four long days using any remaining blacksmiths equipment he could find the black ice would not break but it would shape when finally my great grandfather held up his work to the gods in offering he claimed that he would fulfil his promise or die trying with a small circular necklace made from the black ice and his new found inspiration takutta walked away from the southern water tribe city and began the long journey home before he did he carved that message into the blade so that he never forgot his promise to the gods to himself and to nori
8221306 come on katara what happened did he get home alright did he find nori
8221307 takutta travelled the world searching for nori and trying to find his way back home many people were kind to him and many were not many times he was attacked by fire nation soldiers but he forgot his old cowardly ways and held onto the promise he had made to himself and to my grandmother the knife was his only possession and he depended on it as if he were holding the universe in his hands it took him almost two years to find his way back home to the northern water tribe it was untouched by the fire nation and just as he remembered it many cried when they saw him return many thought he was a spirit but he was welcomed back as a true hero and his story told across the globe
8221308 when he found nori she wept in his arms cursing him for ever leaving her but never once letting go of him on the third day after his return he presented my great grandmother with a betrothal necklace carved from the black ice she accepted and they were married soon my grandfather was born and they both lived long and fruitful lives but my grandfather never forgot his promise and kept the black ice blade with him always when he died it was passed down from generation to generation many people tried to steal it or claim it as their own they all wanted the blade that had saved one single man from complete and total destruction
8221309 shouldnt you have inherited it instead of your mothers necklace
8221310 if only i knew nobody seems to know what happened to noris necklace it seemed to just disappear

8221362 i den korte verison er det ikke kun det danske marked der er problemet andre vigtige markeder s som det svenske franske og hollandske marked har ogs store konomiske vanskeligheder n r man ser p metro internationals tab inden for de seneste seks m neder og n r man betragter de negative udsigter for annoncemarkedet generelt ser vi ikke nogen tegn p at der skulle ske forbedringer i regnskabet i anden halvdel af 2008
8221363 hvis man ser p metro internationals aktiev rdi der er faldet med ca 50 pct p et par m neder er de allerede blevet h rdt straffet s at d mme p den udvikling har aktiemarkedet ikke nogen store forventninger til at de n r m let om break even i forvejen det er der ikke nogen investorer der tror p
8221364 nej det virker ikke som et godt skridt hvis man ser p hvor l nge 24timer ville have overlevet hvis metro ikke havde k bt den
8221365 det kan han bedst selv svare p men i begyndelsen af ret har ledelsen vel troet p at de havde en god chance for at n m let og nu vil de ikke opgive det f r alle muligheder er udt mte men hvis vi sammenligner den nuv rende makro konomiske situation med den vi havde tilbage i januar ser det v rre ud nu det er en negativ tendens der p virker alle markeder og dermed ogs annonc rerne s niveauet for adspending vil blive ramt
8221366 den vil formentlig blive v rre og eftersp rgslen vil fra begyndelsen af 2009 v re lavere end i begyndelsen af 2008 vi forventer en flad til negativ v kst samlet set for 2009

8221559 some areas have experienced no price drop whatsoever in july we had our best month in over a year
8221560 its possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
8221561 buyers feel property values are declining and its not yet a good time to buy
8221562 secondly a lot of folks are losing jobs a lot of folks are afraid their jobs may be in jeopardy
8221563 lo que est colgado en youtube y ha sacado el mundo es una versi n parcial de la noticia
8221564 yo reafirmo el valor period stico de lo que quisimos hacer
8221565 bueno a n insiste en que lo que hicieron tiene valor agregado o a adido como prefieran
8221566 thats put us in a bind its really getting to a critical stage
8221567 while the poverty and disease that afflict africa and other parts of the world is heartbreaking we cannot ignore the conditions that have led to desperate conditions on our indian reservations
8221568 indian people are dying across this country from inadequate health care
8221569 it seems as though they believe a certain number of native american people are expendable
8221570 personally i would suffer the care of my children would suffer
8221571 mostly what youve got today is good news but i wouldnt say weve turned the corner or anything like that
8221572 we all think we should keep up or do better than the cost of living and ive done that but the last nine months kind of snuck up i just started noticing less money
8221573 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8221574 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8221575 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8221576 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8221577 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8221578 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8221579 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8221580 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8221581 it was like a horror story they got handled like they were criminals
8221582 ongoing investigation and yesterdays action was just the first part
8221583 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
8221584 when i sent you the budget for the new jail you approved it
8221585 the board of commissioners was informed from the beginning that to open this jail i would need a total of 22 jailers and a full time jail administrator in order to run the new jail
8221586 its too late for him to come back with these changes
8221587 theres no law against it but its certainly not a very feasible thing to do
8221588 im not so unwise as to suggest that there hasnt been a need for better management
8221589 the changes are modest they are tiny we havent solved the uninsured problem
8221590 as we head into tough economic times we need to maintain our commitment to husky we can make it more effective by reducing bureaucratic hurdles for parents enrolling their children in the program and expanding local outreach
8221591 custo est mais que coberto pelas economias que estamos realizando
8221592 compromisso para tentar melhorar a maneira como respondemos s preocupa es e cr ticas
8221593 imagine this is an audio mash up of gw bush singing the john lennon classic
8221594 the american people are dumb enough to give the republicans another shot
8221595 in the most recent poll i am ahead by a commanding 1 percent
8221596 right now we are holding a majority by the skin of joe liebermans teeth
8221597 and president obama is going to need a working majority in the senate
8221598 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8221599 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8221600 i want to get young people everywhere engaged and active and really questioning
8221601 what right do older generations have to jeopardize our future
8221602 we wanted to kick off in the most effective way possible and unite kids from all over the place
8221603 i always wanted to do something for the environment but i didnt know what to do
8221604 obama and chief strategist david axelrod are clearly aware of what past campaigns did right and what they did wrong
8221605 there were lessons we really learned from howard deans primary
8221606 you cant just have this internet presence it has to be real on the ground
8221607 we were still working over the speech text in the car over to the fleet center in 2004
8221608 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8221609 barr on colbert so close to a discussion about global warming but no cigar
8221610 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
8221611 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
8221612 how much celebrity drivel weather reports local cop chases and corporate cover ups from the
8221613 undoing legislation already passed by that other pesky branch of government the legislative
8221614 obama will communicate the urgency of the moment highlight the struggles americans are facing and call on americans to come together to change the course of our nation
8221615 the president already has the mark of the american people hes the worst president we ever had
8221616 the miami herald and usa today reported george w bush would have widened his 537 vote victory to a 1 665 vote margin if the recount ordered by the florida supreme court would have been allowed to continue
8221617 clinton ordered the attack friday but the raid was delayed a day so it would not fall on the muslim sabbath the missiles struck late at night between 1 a m and 2 a m baghdad time because clinton wished to minimize possible deaths of innocent civilians
8221618 however tempting it might be to some when much trouble lies ahead to step aside adroitly and put someone else up to take the blows i do not intend to take that cowardly course but on the contrary to stand to my post and persevere in accordance with my duty as i see it
8221619 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8221620 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8221621 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism

8221623 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8221624 while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today

8221627 in arizona the only way to get around is by small private plane
8221628 we coach little league in the blue states and have gay friends in the red states
8221629 now theres some people who say george bush is doing a great job
8221630 no no wait hold up give me a chance let me explain i know i know what youre saying youre saying george bush is out of touch he doesnt understand me or my suffering and i hear ya but hear me out hey listen im doing pretty well myself cant complain but let me tell you about a friend of mine

8221648 probably never in history has a major corporation been twisted to such evil ends yet what is most disturbing is that for most of its past the conglomerate and its predecessor companies embodied many of the qualities we admire in business today its managers were inventive and diligent and its scientists discovered vital medicines with quite a few earning nobel prizes

8221650 the preservation and empowerment of long term family wealth is based on the education and behavior of each family member its a dynamic process that must be re energized in each successive generation
8221651 no matter how large or small your estate or income level you can take the steps towards optimizing the true wealth within your family
8221652 its a matter of every family member recognizing the relative value of each asset and acting appropriately to optimize it

8221654 i think we pigeonhole our kids too quickly into one sport so they are robbed of experimentation or discovering their own loves and interests
8221655 kids change their mind so quickly about what they like to do
8221656 youre a good mom and your kids arent so bad either
8221657 its too hard on the knees and too hard on the minivan tires
8221658 kids need the chance to be kids and not be stressed
8221659 i just want my kids to be happy why you shouldnt say it why you shouldnt think it what you should embrace instead
8221660 its all in the hands of the parents and coaches and unfortunately they cross the line too often
8221661 wow this was such a great idea im so glad we came
8221662 yes this was just great i cant wait to meet up with you guys again tonight
8221663 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine

8221667 the time has come to research and quantify the benefits of radiation therapy and make clearer the role the radiation oncologist plays in curing cancer and improving the quality of life for people living with cancer
8221668 we believe that open objective research will demonstrate the value that radiation oncology brings to cancer care throughout the world
8221669 the radiation oncology institute has been established to develop innovative ways of enhancing the profile of radiation oncology in the world cancer community and to help prepare the specialty for the future
8221670 our plan is for roi to conduct objective research on the specialty to document the value safety efficacy and cost effectiveness of radiation therapy with the goal of stepping up the profile of radiation therapy within the medical community to ensure that cancer patients have access to the treatments that are best for them their lifestyle and their cancer
8221671 astro turns 50 this year in our first half century radiation therapy has made remarkable strides and has become a mainstay in the treatment of cancer indeed the majority of cancer patients receive radiation therapy either as their definitive treatment or along with other treatments like surgery and chemotherapy
8221672 with the roi we begin our journey into the next 50 years and our mission to gather critical data fund important research and educational initiatives in radiation oncology with the ultimate goal of ensuring that cancer patients have access to the life saving treatments required to maximize cure and optimize quality of life

8221711 australians have private health insurance so that they can have a choice of doctor and of hospital and have their treatment when they need it
8221712 the ama predicted after the governments budget announcement on the medicare levy that health insurers would be looking to compensate by introducing managed care arrangements now it appears that prediction is coming to pass
8221713 this would allow private health insurers to make the choices for you
8221714 your private health insurance fund will tell you who you can see and which hospital you should go to and there will be waiting lists for treatment
8221715 this will be us style managed care in australia dressed up as private hospital benchmarks
8221716 managed care means patients have less choice and longer waiting times for surgery just as we experience public hospital bureaucrats making decisions in the public sector we will have health insurance bureaucrats making decisions for patients in the private sector
8221717 more importantly managed care means the health insurer not the doctor decides on the type of medical care that the insured patient receives rather than making a decision based on whats best for the patient the insurer is likely to make a decision on what costs the least
8221718 obviously this has the potential to seriously compromise the quality of care
8221719 allowing health insurers to dictate which doctor you will see and which hospital you can go to and to interfere with your clinical care completely undermines the value of holding private health insurance
8221720 it may be in the interests of health insurers to save their bottom line but its certainly not in the interests of patients
8221721 weve already seen what can happen when benchmarks are linked to funding the allegations in victoria that hospitals have been falsifying patient records to meet performance targets should act as a warning to the federal government
8221722 we need to make sure there is transparency and understand that hospitals and doctors cannot necessarily be compared as they may cover different case mix and patient risk profiles health benchmarks should not be used for perverse incentives which may lower patient care
8221723 by all means have honest reporting and use the information to improve systems and services
8221724 but the data must not be used to reduce appropriate care to meet a performance indicator in order receive a performance payment or make savings at the cost of patients
8221725 amsa academy strives to empower medical students to effect change in medicine
8221726 as the world of medicine changes everyday the next generation of physicians will need different skills than their predecessors the modern healthcare system needs physicians with a broader understanding of their patients the ability to draw on multiple disciplines outside of medical science and the ability to effect change in an imperfect healthcare delivery system
8221727 hospitals face many challenges in caring for a rapidly changing patient population
8221728 sensitivity and responsiveness to cultural and language needs impact the quality of care patient safety and patient and family satisfaction this commonwealth fund supported initiative will provide a firm foundation for standards that foster culturally competent patient centered care
8221729 this study not only describes the mechanism of cyclosporine in the kidney
8221730 it also sheds light on the pathogenesis of proteinuric diseases in general suggesting that the immune system is much less important for this type of disease than anticipated
8221731 the research found this noninvasive method of cardiac imaging will effectively detect stenosis a constriction or narrowing of the coronary arteries which can lead to heart attacks and may require surgery to repair
8221732 this is good news for patients who in the past might have been forced to undergo a more expensive and invasive procedure to determine if they suffered from blockages in the arteries leading to their hearts
8221733 diagnostic performance of 64 multidetector row coronary computed tomographic angiography for evaluation of coronary artery stenosis in individuals without known coronary artery disease
8221734 no study has been able to directly link changes in the brain with changes in memory so our study helps to fill in this gap
8221735 although the findings do not change overall debate on the use of estrogen therapy to reduce age related cognitive decline our study illustrates that specific molecules may be identified that are critical to estrogens ability to modulate memory
8221736 therefore it may be possible to design drugs to target these molecules and directly affect memory and since such drugs would not be hormones they could produce the beneficial effects of estrogen treatment without the side effects of current hormone therapy
8221737 this may be a unique path toward potential drug development
8221738 if we are able to understand the genetic cues involved in rapid python heart muscle increases and decreases that to me says there is the potential to develop therapeutics for humans
8221739 pythons can eat up to 100 percent of their body weight at one sitting so they have to be able to respond metabolically in a dramatic way
8221740 we think several of the striking changes we see in python physiology may have significant potential for the pharmaceutical industry
8221741 there are some striking examples of extreme adaptations by animals in the wild and i think its a good idea from a biomedical standpoint to take a closer look at them
8221742 we believe we have made a major step forward in the treatment of end stage prostate cancer patients
8221743 evident that enzymes related to androgen metabolism that are over expressed in aipc could be targets for endocrine treatment
8221744 caution is indeed in order and it is too early to warrant too much excitement and raise expectations amongst patients just yet
8221745 clearly looks promising it is still at the early stages of clinical development
8221746 it will be crucial to look carefully at the balance between its benefits and harms before drawing firm conclusions about the usefulness of this new drug
8221747 important side effects often only emerge with the larger clinical studies that now need to be done
8221748 we appreciate mikes generous contribution of his time talent and drive to generate revenue for innovative drug discovery and raise awareness of addfs mission with the participation of interested people from all fields we hope to find a cure for alzheimers and dementia related disease
8221749 i am fortunate enough to be able to compete in these types of races and firmly believe that it would be selfish of me to do so and not try to help others the addf is at the forefront of drug discovery research i want to do my part in helping to find a treatment for ad which will bring relief to patients and families everywhere
8221750 sting plays a very fundamentally important role in the recognition of virus infection
8221751 we respond by making interferon if you dont have interferon you have no antiviral defense
8221752 this molecule facilitates the production of interferon and innate immune response in reaction to dna viruses and certain rna viruses
8221753 a major discovery that provides important information about the mechanisms whereby dna cancer viruses such as hpv and ebv evade the immune system
8221754 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
8221755 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
8221756 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
8221757 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
8221758 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
8221759 getting the most from nursing school a guide to becoming a nurse
8221760 i wrote this book because nursing school is extremely challenging for even the most resourceful students
8221761 the book is aimed at helping students to acquire the knowledge skills and attitudes they will need to become clinically competent and caring nurses
8221762 i believe that helping students who have the potential to become great nurses will not only improve the profession but will also improve the nations healthcare system
8221763 i hope to provide these talented individuals the tools to get the most out of nursing school and to become excellent care providers policy makers educators and researchers
8221764 even for a highly decorated and often recognized scientist like bob this represents a remarkable and extraordinary achievement
8221765 i am particularly excited and pleased to see dr lefkowitz work recognized in this way as his discoveries represent the very best in translational science and medicine and have served to ultimately improve the health and lives of millions of people around the globe
8221766 deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to knowledge in the physical biological mathematical or engineering sciences
8221767 the national medal of science is a great personal and professional honor that reflects my entire career in the life sciences
8221768 one of the most rewarding aspects of my career at duke has been the opportunity to mentor more than 200 very talented students and fellows many of them have gone on to distinguished careers in academia and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries this award honors them as much as it does me i really cant imagine a more fulfilling career for me than to have been a professor of medicine and a scientist i am as excited about the opportunities and challenges of our work at present as i have ever been and i am so honored that the president will acknowledge our cumulative body of work in medicine and the biological sciences
8221769 im thrilled that bob is being honored in this way as it really is a recognition and celebration of not only his well documented seminal discoveries but more importantly the incredible body of scientific work that has characterized his long and illustrious career
8221770 he is an inspiration to the next generation of basic scientists not only at duke but around the world
8221771 i firmly believe the key to improving quality is having nurses at the bedside our current practice has created diversions that pull nurses from consistent bedside nursing
8221772 i was thrilled to learn about vhas rapid adoption network our participation in this initiative has opened a door of networking for our staff that is invaluable
8221773 vhas clinical improvement platform focuses on helping members become leading performers
8221774 our programs and services will help guide members towards success and improve clinical care across the country
8221775 hospitals are working hard to improve the quality and safety of their nursing care return to care is one critical strategy to help them do so
8221776 by focusing on nursing issues we are having an immediate impact on the quality of care that is delivered to all patients
8221777 i am delighted that people living in east lothian will benefit from this new treatment option we have to be as flexible as possible in how we deliver a range of treatments to match peoples needs
8221778 this is a first step in improving access to psychological therapies and gives scottish patients an additional choice in their struggle with low mood and depression
8221779 hold very still maddie so i can get it straight
8221780 como todo esto tambi n es una cuesti n de criterio pero la realidad es que se encuentra igual que en madrid
8221781 cada d a iremos disminuyendo la sedaci n y viendo como reacciona
8221782 todas las lesiones que padece su respuesta al tratamiento y las posibles consecuencias futuras
8221783 a really important aspect of it is our ability to really be able to quantify what the benefit is
8221784 the green meter capability coupled with what we can already compute in terms of miles that would otherwise be traveled or gas expenditures that are associated with people going to these meetings as well as productivity loss with those travel hours is significant
8221785 green meter detects through the ip internet protocol locations of all those attendees who would travel to the host and through a series of complex algorithms is able to measure and provide metrics of what the carbon emission output would be from the trip as well as the fuel costs and fuel amounts associated with that trip
8221786 we first launched green meter a little over a year ago and since then across ilincs customers were going to save almost 2 billion pounds of carbon emissions this year
8221787 we err on the side of being extremely conservative because the numbers are so good
8221788 based on the distance of those flights it can determine the size of the jet that youd be taking
8221789 its very intuitive because of what our developers have built into it
8221790 the idea for this came from the governor janet napolitano herself who cast her efficiency review steering committee which is composed of senior staff in her office to basically go out and look for strategies that would help benefit the environment reduce travel and provide another basket of benefits that are associated with this kind of technology for web conferencing
8221791 we have end to end aes advanced encryption standard encryption that is the highest government level you can get
8221792 so that means everything that is leaving my computer right now gets encrypted and then it doesnt get unencrypted until it hits your computer
8221793 i think that in these times of tight budgets and increased sensitivity to the environment that web conferencing when done correctly can really provide a strong benefit for state and local governments
8221794 i have to say that while this is the worst year ever for chinas petrochemical sector the worst is still not yet past
8221795 will we ever know what the answer to life really is can you really tell me what life is maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you could be swept away by fates own hand

8221802 editamos muchas cosas per fer pa s y en beneficio de la cultura catalana y eso est bien muy bien pero en el fondo si s lo se justifica por el apoyo institucional se vuelve un sistema perverso el libro en catal n necesita apoyo pues el mercado es muy peque o pero sobre todo necesita fomento de la creaci n tenemos que desmarcarnos de editar t tulos s lo justificados en la subvenci n creo que tenemos que hacer apuestas m s editoriales y m s selectivas y a la vez exigir resultados econ micos

8221804 el objetivo es simplificar la empresa que ahora es demasiado complicada cambiar su cultura y forma de actuar para darle mayor agilidad y rapidez en las decisiones lo cual requiere por ejemplo desjerarquizarla y fomentar el trabajo en equipo y por proyectos ya estamos poniendo en marcha una intranet para tener mejor comunicaci n interna

8221808 there surely is money to be made in some of the financial stocks particularly if you are patient many financial companies still have good franchises and good balance sheets
8221809 they have managed to avoid most of the mortgage problems that have brought down some of their competitors as a result they should pick up business and perhaps acquire weaker players
8221810 we are concerned that there is more bad news ahead for a number of financial institutions
8221811 in baseball terminology we may be in the middle or late innings of the subprime mortgage mess but were probably in the early innings for problems with other real estate loans and different types of business loans
8221812 that will compensate you if you have to wait a while for the stocks to rebound

8221817 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8221818 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8221819 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8221820 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8221821 im so in the moment i dont have to recognize that i just kicked you in the face

8221848 you go to many places today and the computer lab is closed or they cant repair them or they become obsolete because they dont have a plan to renew or buy more
8221849 its a first step but its not even the most important one in my mind
8221850 when a company buys technology there has to be an implementation plan
8221851 governments should do exactly the same on a larger scale
8221852 is it possible to develop any work in the sense of integrating them to the digital inclusion movement

8221867 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body

8221893 while retail and export demand for chicken remained relatively strong during the quarter casual dining and food service customers have been affected by a significant decline in restaurant traffic due to weak economic conditions and higher fuel prices
8221894 our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 reflect difficult market conditions for our industry
8221895 while retail and export demand for chicken remained relatively strong during the quarter casual dining and food service customers have been affected by a significant decline in restaurant traffic due to weak economic conditions and higher fuel prices at the same time the markets for both corn and soybean meal have remained high and volatile resulting in significantly higher feed costs the combination of much higher costs and the imbalance between domestic supply and demand in the food service markets resulted in much lower margins
8221896 wir haben einen teuren kader und genug spieler dass muss einfach reichen
8221897 i have been very impressed by the top quality entries from edinburgh and lothians this year and congratulate all the finalists from this region on making it on to the shortlist and wish them the best of luck in the final stages
8221898 the scottish thistle awards give us a fantastic opportunity to celebrate the highest quality tourism businesses in edinburgh and lothians
8221899 the cans were a massive part of our campaign and were designed to maintain awareness our research had found that many people found that the galleries were not for them and we wanted to use this to change that view it was also an attempt to take a bit of warhol outside if you dont come in to see it well take it to you
8221900 what was really compelling was the photography used it is the magnificent backdrop of the castle fairground and the big wheel that is edinburghs iconic imagery and encourages people to come here
8221901 the convener would provide leadership and would be the recognisable face of scottish elections thats something gould was very keen on
8221902 the convener would have statutory power of direction so he could require his fellow returning officers to do something in a particular way
8221903 edinburgh is rich in economic assets the city is a world renowned tourist destination one of europes foremost financial services centres and is home to a growing cutting edge life sciences industry
8221904 on top of that the labour market in the capital continues to perform robustly and the signs are that the property market in scotland continues to show greater resilience than elsewhere in the uk
8221905 by playing to our clear strengths here in scotland and in edinburgh i am convinced we are well placed to weather the new challenges we are facing and emerge stronger than before
8221906 if we redouble efforts to work together and promote edinburgh as a great place to do business and to visit we can ensure the capitals economy continues to grow
8221907 i can guarantee the government will fully support your efforts to help edinburgh go from strength to strength
8221908 on top of that well continue to look at how we can make sure the planning system operates with the efficiency and certainty needed to support economic growth
8221909 and well continue to push westminster to act on the cost of fuel an issue i know effects business of all sizes by working together i believe we can make edinburgh and scotland a more successful place
8221910 despite the credit crunch there are many funds holding billions of pounds that could be invested in scotland we are working hard to ensure that the city and the country creates the conditions to attract our share of that investment
8221911 in spite of the evidence from economists around the world that metro regions are the new drivers of national wealth the development of a truly integrated economic strategy transport infrastructure and unified partnership across the city region remains work in progress it is plain that our ability to compete with the growing family of world cities depends upon it
8221912 we continually evaluate and evolve these shows and this is part of the evolution of boogie in the morning
8221913 arlene will provide another dimension which is what we need particularly given the competition from other breakfast shows
8221914 shes married with family and will offer a different set of experiences and a broader appeal
8221915 it will still have a scottish voice unlike some of our competitors
8221916 at that time of the night stations like forth do struggle to get big names into radio stations
8221917 by offering the chance to get heard across scotland we will be able to get bigger names and provide better content
8221918 id be silly to say that money wont be saved but in the whole scheme of things it is not a great deal of money as far as the programming is concerned it is the content that is key
8221919 it is not a surprise that this has happened and bauer arent to be blamed as it is happening to other local radio stations across the uk
8221920 what should be thought about now is the role of regulator ofcom to what degree should it look to reserve control for the regions
8221921 there is still demand for local radio because people get tired of the same old stuff and want broadcasting that speaks to and for them
8221922 in the east of scotland for example people say they will go out to get their messages they want people on radio to speak to them like that and use these phrases it makes for a closer relationship
8221923 this is a tragic set of circumstances because of inexcusable failure to secure windows and an old lady died the tragedy is that this was so easily preventable
8221924 in our opinion if she was that determined to get out she would have done whether it was because she was upset or she panicked and thought there had been a fire alarm we will never know
8221925 the main thing we miss is the view from our flat we had a great view of the castle on to arthurs seat and beyond and from another window we could see the pentlands
8221926 the place always had a bad reputation but we never had any bother
8221927 the ice cream van used to be able to drive through the pillars that support the building but you couldnt fit a car under there now
8221928 a few of my neighbours are disabled and there are some that never leave the house
8221929 the whole point of this is to give people nearing the end of their lives the chance to die with dignity in a place of their choice the reality is old and frail people come to nursing homes to die they know they are not going to move on from there and its amazing how so many of them accept this when they arrive
8221930 this work is essential to guarantee that we are giving elderly people the dignified and respectful care programme they deserve
8221931 this study shows that with better training and improved care frameworks older people can now expect a better standard of care around dying in these nursing homes
8221932 but the teduray lambiangan and dulangan manobo tribespeople demanded that they should be recognized as lumad that their culture should be respected and that they should be allowed to govern their ancestral domain according to their traditions beliefs and justice system
8221933 we want an assurance that the bangsamoro moro nation would recognize our age old peace pact with them and leave to us what are ours
8221934 should the government go through a deliberate review of the moa ad then we must have a seat not just as observers but members who can interact with other panel members and defend and protect what are ours
8221935 there should be a third party in the talks there should be a separate panel composed of tribal leaders in mindanao and palawan the indigenous peoples have a right to assert recognition
8221936 if the government and the milf leaders will not hear us we will again call for a similar gathering to consult the tribes on the next step
8221937 the ruling has been suspended on an interim basis until a hearing on september 9 the children can attend musselburgh burgh primary school until a decision is reached
8221938 the children already have an association with stoneyhill through the nursery having won their case in court the council should have the grace to place them in that school theres no legal reason why they cant have more than 25 children in a class
8221939 im very surprised at the sheriffs decision because this could cause pandemonium in terms of the precedent it will set
8221940 usually parents do not win appeals i would think local authorities will be very worried about the precedent
8221941 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8221942 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8221943 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8221944 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8221945 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8221946 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8221947 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8221948 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8221949 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8221950 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8221951 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8221952 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8221953 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8221954 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8221955 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8221956 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8221957 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8221958 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8221959 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
8221960 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8221961 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again
8221962 the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20 degrees and it rains rains rains
8221963 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather
8221964 in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8221965 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8221966 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8221967 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8221968 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all
8221969 it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to
8221970 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8221971 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8221972 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8221973 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8221974 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8221975 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
8221976 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8221977 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8221978 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8221979 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8221980 he was one of the best when i was in russia
8221981 he is very quick technically he is very good he is good in one on one situations and he can make chances for other players
8221982 how he would do in england is difficult to know i didnt know how i was going to do in england
8221983 he is a good player and i would like to see him in england it would be good for him to come to see how good it is here compared to russia
8221984 we have not forgotten what we did last season but we know what we need to do again this year
8221985 we need to show we are a good team we want to have the same experiences and show we are still focussed and ready to win more trophies
8221986 they are owned by one of the biggest companies in the world so they have money which is important now
8221987 it means they can buy good players as well as finding their own which they do very well
8221988 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8221989 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8221990 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8221991 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8221992 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8221993 es war nicht gemeint dass das den universit ten fehlt das wird ersetzt
8221994 zu sagen es sollen jene bevorzugt werden die es sich leisten k nnen hie e die qualifikation am einkommen der eltern festzustellen
8221995 bei ausbildungen die sehr berufsspezifisch sind ist es im interesse aller beteiligter fr h auf neigungen und f higkeiten draufzukommen
8221996 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8221997 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8221998 este es el mayor allanamiento contra una f brica que hemos realizado en estados unidos hasta la fecha
8221999 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8222000 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8222001 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8222002 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8222003 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8222004 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8222005 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8222006 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8222007 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8222008 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8222009 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8222010 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8222011 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8222012 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8222013 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8222014 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8222015 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8222016 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8222017 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8222018 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8222019 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8222020 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8222021 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
8222022 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
8222023 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
8222024 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
8222025 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
8222026 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
8222027 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
8222028 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
8222029 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
8222030 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
8222031 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
8222032 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8222033 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8222034 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8222035 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8222036 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8222037 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8222038 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8222039 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8222040 despite raising 249 2 million 459 million in may to put against debt its had to postpone the latest dividend for the same reason
8222041 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8222042 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8222043 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8222044 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8222045 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8222046 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8222047 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8222048 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8222049 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8222050 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8222051 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8222052 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8222053 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8222054 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8222055 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8222056 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
8222057 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
8222058 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
8222059 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8222060 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8222061 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8222062 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8222063 second as others have pointed out mccain is perilously close to turning his pow record into a punchline
8222064 like so many john mccain served our country bravely and suffered for years as a pow for that he deserves our thanks and respect and we have paid and continue to pay him that respect but having been a pow is not an excuse for a litany of bad votes in the senate and wrong positions as a candidate having been a pow is not an excuse for voting against veterans benefits or an excuse for supporting president bushs tax cuts for the wealthy or an excuse for supporting the use of torture john mccain was a brave soldier but he cannot hide behind that experience and use it as an excuse for every bad decision hes made since hes being anything but brave as a senator and as a candidate he should continue to use that bravery to try to defend those positions if he truly believes in them he should not hide behind his war experiences thats the opposite of bravery if they can figure out an artful term for it call him a damn wimp
8222065 we had to sit around in the dirt and eat if we were lucky
8222066 actually newt gingrich is working to help prevent climate change
8222067 seems everyone that believes in gravity also hate ice cream
8222068 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8222069 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8222070 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8222071 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8222072 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8222073 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8222074 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8222075 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8222076 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8222077 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8222078 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
8222079 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
8222080 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
8222081 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
8222082 i had no idea anyone was going to die the only person i thought was going to be killed was pj and then myself
8222083 im really happy that the idea has now became reality the enthusiasm from the arts officers from east lothian council the artists the participants from the resource centre and the school have made this a huge success and a valuable piece of joint working
8222084 it was a bit funny going onto a bus and finding a gallery inside but it was wonderful the workshop was great i made a picture of a boat and a rainbow from things found on the beach
8222085 we are extremely aggrieved with the baggage handling company it appears that the handler was driven too close to the aircraft the rule is you have to be at least three metres away so one can only assume hes tried to take a shortcut
8222086 the scottish vision strategy signals our determination to work together to make a real and lasting difference to eye health and to improve the lives of those who have lost some or all of their sight
8222087 we have here a real opportunity to secure world class services over the next five years
8222088 too many people in scotland are still not fully aware of the impact their lifestyles and health conditions can have on their sight
8222089 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8222090 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
8222091 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
8222092 it is not only the jurors right but his duty to find the verdict according to his own best understanding judgment and conscience though in direct opposition to the direction of the court
8222093 though in direct opposition to the direction of the court
8222094 jury nullification is the law so it cant possibly undermine the law
8222095 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
8222096 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
8222097 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
8222098 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
8222099 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
8222100 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
8222101 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
8222102 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
8222103 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
8222104 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
8222105 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
8222106 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
8222107 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
8222108 okay so see that paint color behind the murderer there do you think it would look good with stainless steel appliances
8222109 i know and its not just a fridge youre buying you also have to love that brand dishwasher and oven too so they all match
8222110 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
8222111 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
8222112 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
8222113 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
8222114 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8222115 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8222116 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8222117 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8222118 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8222119 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8222120 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8222121 well let you know if we can use your services
8222122 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
8222123 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
8222124 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
8222125 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
8222126 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
8222127 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
8222128 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
8222129 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
8222130 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
8222131 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
8222132 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
8222133 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
8222134 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
8222135 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
8222136 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
8222137 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
8222138 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
8222139 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
8222140 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
8222141 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
8222142 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
8222143 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
8222144 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
8222145 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
8222146 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
8222147 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
8222148 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
8222149 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
8222150 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
8222151 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
8222152 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
8222153 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
8222154 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
8222155 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
8222156 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8222157 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8222158 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on

8222474 to be quite frank on q and a she came across as a typical middle age women sic articulator sic a pretty reasonable view
8222475 i wonder what it is about greer that makes people whove never met her or even read any of her books feel perfectly comfortable about making personal judgements of her personality appearance and manner while completely ignoring her arguments
8222476 do you think that feminism was the most successful revolution of the 20th century
8222477 what it is about greer that makes people whove never met her or even read any of her books feel perfectly comfortable about making personal judgements of her personality appearance and manner while completely ignoring her arguments
8222478 clearly theres an over writing of her image with all sorts of gendered stereotypes
8222479 id say it was poetics rather than serious policy work
8222480 germaine greers passionate and powerfully worded essay about aboriginal rage is a provocation that will cause heated and intense debate
8222481 i wonder if this is why peter singer left oz as well
8222482 maybe greg sheridan and bob carr could move to london and see how they go as global public intellectuals
8222483 germaine greers passionate and powerfully worded essay about aboriginal rage is a provocation that will cause heated and intense debate
8222484 being a critic at a time of a national catastrophe
8222485 klaus thanks for that i havent read either whitefella jump up or any responses though
8222486 i think a lot of the tossers who diss greer just want to make their own little minds seem bigger than they are ultimate tall poppy syndrome
8222487 the alternatives are inevitably ghettoized cultures permanent strife and eventually civil wars
8222488 so far there is no evidence that the postworld war ii intake of nonanglomorph immigrants generates opposition to our hegemonially anglomorph culture and political system
8222489 occasionally such ethnic diversions can be exploited to subvert our general system
8222490 there can be no reason for deanglifying a country such as this
8222491 anglomorphy as a dominant way of life is good enough where a country is marked or crowned by it
8222492 the aboriginal establishment is going to pour oil over me for sexualising the problem
8222493 i think youre reinforcing my perception of the gendered aspect of the reaction to greer
8222494 while i appreciate that a lot of people were opposed to the nt emergency response either as a package or in part i would urge you to read what women and some men in the communities are saying about how it has changed their lives
8222495 are there a lot of fairy tales for troglodytes written with wit and verve
8222496 the battle for australia incorporates all those battles that were fought by australians in the pacific war and in a period during which the australian mainland itself was in danger of being invaded by the japanese

8222500 welfare mentalities dysfunctional behaviour and all sorts of culturally justified explanations about and for our benefit to understand ourselves apparerently
8222501 no doubt my shameful lack of contrition is due to my disgraceful celtic italic heritage
8222502 why use one clear sentence when four pompous paragraphs will do
8222503 the culture shock of conflict b w the pre modern natives and post modern settlers caused a collapse in indigenous males alpha social status and eventually the indigenous communitys social structure
8222504 knowledge of anthropology is not necessary for better social policy
8222505 but ignorance indifference or inimicality to realistic anthropology amongst the so called
8222506 so just as in the lord of the flies her majestys military forces had to be called in civilise boys gone feral in a remote desert location
8222507 your ancestry no doubt being of a more modern and pedestrian kind

8222516 the deplorable cases of gang rapes of girls who happened to be christians by boys who happened to be muslim
8222517 if the allegations were ture why did the police not effect the arrest at the time of the incident this is plainly and simply mugabes master plan to hassle and provoke mdc mps in an attempt to get a rise out of them or just to arrest them because they can they are here and they are waiting to take me
8222518 they came around and demanded that i get out but i told them its too early they threatened to break down the door but i dared them to try it
8222519 it is clear zanu pf is on a retributive campaign after bitterly losing the post of speaker in parliament
8222520 we have been magnanimous in victory they must also be distinguished in defeat
8222521 the purported opening by mugabe the illegitimate usurper of the peoples will as reflected on 29 march 2008 elections is illegal and of no force and effect
8222522 the only person who can officially open this session of parliament will be determined by the outcome of the on going dialogue sponsored by sadc southern african development community
8222523 i am not so sure that mbeki is up to the job he is about to be replaced in south africa and he has publicly stated that he support mugabe and his zanu pf party can we really guarantee that he is not going to twist the knife and make life even harder for the mdc what happened today shows the obligations on both sides that negotiations should continue until we reach a negotiated settlement i hope the facilitator mbeki as a matter of urgency will re convene the talks so that dialogue will resume
8222524 as the search for a negotiated solution to the political crisis continues journalists are still being subjected to police brutality arbitrary arrest and constant intimidation
8222525 trying to hide the destitution of the population by arresting witnesses is shameful

8222614 many of us are distraught about the startling withdrawal of stephen colbert from his bid for the presidency
8222615 but now with obama inauguration coundown and mccain inauguration countdown ivoters can look to the future and celebrate the winners in americas political selection process
8222616 the impression we all had was that things were running very smoothly
8222617 when youre running something this size it always takes a few days to work out the kinks
8222618 i think its going to be pretty plush living to be honest with you
8222619 were excited to be helping the school out during their crisis
8222620 that all led us to find about 400 people on a waiting list for housing toward the middle of july
8222621 they offered us virtually everything we could have possibly ever wanted
8222622 what theyre charging us is what we charge the students
8222623 theyre going to have their world and the rest of the hotel will continue to operate normally
8222624 weve let them know theyre going to be held accountable for their behavior
8222625 ultimately long term we need to build new residence halls and acquire additional housing
8222626 did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for tns that was also economically in the best interests of the gfk shareholders
8222627 i think that there is significant value in continuing to operate tns on a standalone basis
8222628 if wpp are willing to put a reasonable offer forward to shareholders i think that will be considered but in our view shareholders are being shortchanged by the offer that is in front of them
8222629 its less evident why this is a good idea for us
8222630 tns can hope for a counterbidder but that seems most unlikely
8222631 wpp doesnt need to raise its offer because theres no one else to bid against
8222632 please dont play this for anyone i dont normally do this

8222635 i trust that he has the interest of the youngest soldier in his command in his heart and that he will not leave a single soldier in iraq one day longer than necessary
8222636 we need as a country to be focusing more enforcement against those employers who are kind of holding a carrot out at the end of the stick
8222637 slice off a small part of who i am i refuse to do that theres nothing positive really that they bring to the table they are the death of true representative government
8222638 peter and nathan will discover they have not one but two living relatives they werent aware they had
8222639 the state has some very serious concerns about mr driscoll being out on bail
8222640 the state has serious concerns about possible threats of violence that he may have made in the past
8222641 eventually this victim didnt feel prepared to go forward mentally and emotionally
8222642 theyre holding him on charges that theyre not going to give me discovery thats just not fair they cant do that
8222643 one run after the catch i think hes gotten better with his speed and athletic ability after he catches the ball
8222644 the other area i thought he really improved in the spring is in the blocking area of it hes become more physical hes got to improve on the blocking to become an all around tight end for us
8222645 for a big kid he could really run and when you threw him the ball he caught it
8222646 for me i want to do anything to help the team
8222647 the players change and when you get to the professional level its nice to be at a higher level of talent
8222648 but yeah the game is there when a pitcher starts to struggle you wonder if you give him time before talking to him get the bullpen ready the flow is pretty understandable
8222649 but its nice being able to help them out i dont mind the travel but when you do a lot of it it starts to wear you out
8222650 usually theyll be injury free for a while and then just like this like when we brought in edgard clemente and the second day here he pulls a hip flexor muscle pitchers you know are struggling because theyre getting overused a bit as the bullpen wears thin it seems to go in waves like that
8222651 they needed a field and they were going to use the school field at southern vermont
8222652 they asked if i wanted to be involved and i thought it would be just as trainer
8222653 no pretty much after i got done with coaching its just a little different with kids
8222654 the talents good its just sometimes the attitudes are a little different they play like they think theyre in the bigs my aspirations are done ive hung up my cleats
8222655 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8222656 i think at the moment its a lot to ask for
8222657 i can guarantee i will not ever vote to exceed the spending cap
8222658 im not convinced tonight that the fire commissioners have done their due diligence of understanding the cost of this contract particularly in years 2010 and 2011
8222659 were going to continue budgeting with our eyes on protecting the citizens of this city their properties and their lives
8222660 its hard for me to sit back and put a value on the job that they do

8222667 ski dubai puts on an event in its indoor facility and its a camp where theyre bringing in kids and adults and expose them to skiing
8222668 theyre bringing me as someone else to help with the kids
8222669 they dont have any mountains around there to ski but they have an indoor facility and to be able to ski in an indoor facility in dubai is a pretty unique experience
8222670 im looking forward to being able to say hey i skied dubai too
8222671 it will be 120 degrees outside and ill be walking into a facility where its 30 degrees and full of snow i want to get a photo of me walking on the sand dunes with all my gear
8222672 its going to be a cool experience for me and i hope i can inspire some other people to get into skiing and venture out of dubai to hit some real slopes
8222673 hopefully the people that experience the camp will have the opportunity to go somewhere to ski on an actual mountain
8222674 the international skiers include a number of highly ranked world cup racers who will help showcase the national championships
8222675 the races will also provide a good opportunity for our athletes to improve their world rankings
8222676 we are certainly looking forward to this event which hopefully will attract a lot of spectator interest as well
8222677 we have had extra lighting installed at coronet peak and it should be quite spectacular
8222678 this has probably been one of the best camps for us
8222679 its been great we had a big storm about 17 inches of snow in one day and then its been sunny and blue skies ever since
8222680 in the past weve maybe focused on top to bottom training a bit more but at this camp we broke things down and were more specific on skills
8222681 most of what we wanted to do for this camp was to continue to work on the skills weve been developing they are back on real winter snow on a challenging 250 meter course
8222682 the big part is just having the opportunity to get out there and train every day being able to have a consistent course with consistent jumps is great
8222683 weve been really blessed with great weather and the coaching staff has been working hard to keep the course in good condition
8222684 this is probably the best prepared course weve had since ive been down here i think it gives everyone an opportunity to push their skills and spend more time on task its been amazing training for us
8222685 its a really good place for our athletes to get great focus and train i cant think of anyone who has come to this camp and hasnt improved or accomplished something
8222686 when we started coming here there were hardly any teams training at this mountain now its packed with a lot of ski racers the word is out that this is a great place to train
8222687 last winter our chefs created homemade gourmet mustards to accompany the raclette and associated condiments that we serve at our fireside dining at the empire canyon lodge
8222688 these mustards beautifully complement the dried and cured italian and swiss meats raclette cheese cornichons house cured onions and freshly baked breads that we serve at fireside dining the fireside fig mustard has become so very popular with our guests that we decided to package it and make it available for purchase to everyone

8222692 i had the same issue with some of my videos that were converted using visual hub once i upgraded my ipod touch to 2 0 they stopped working i eas confused at first as all of the the ones that still worked were in 4 3 aspect ratio anyway after trying many different solutions and settings i found that if i used ffmpegx instead of visual hub to encode i had no problems with any of the resulting my videos both 16 9 and 4 3 aspect ratio and different frame sizes

8222695 100 000 taka no it is false rashed came to our office in april and asked for tk 1 million as loan but mr choudhury declined to give such loan why you are trying to put false pressure to extract money from us

8222711 during our flood response last year we found that the levels of children trafficked from the state increased in large numbers two of the affected districts arraria and katiyar according to our study have the highest instance of child trafficking the current disaster will increase levels of poverty and desperation and create a favourable environment for traffickers
8222712 save the children will be working towards creating safe spaces for children in the affected districts as we did last year in the flood affected areas of bihar and orissa

8222738 there is no good co ordination between afghanistans army and the international forces in afghanistan
8222739 there is also carelessness because if there is a village instead of bombing it from a very high altitude if you have soldiers in the area they can check the situation
8222740 the international forces present in afghanistan should be regulated on the basis of much more mutual agreements and secondly a framework of authority and responsibility from these forces should be regulated on the basis of afghanistan law and international law
8222741 thirdly the air strikes on civilian targets should stop and the illegal detention of civilians should stop and also un coordinated house searches should stop

8222861 todays long distance dedication comes to us from a shy 21 year old girl in the tiny town of pahrump nevada
8222862 one night after drama class he was cleaning the stalls in the ladies bathroom and we started talking
8222863 i visit him every week despite protests from my family and friends even though he told me before he left that fateful morning that he really hated ducks i know he didnt mean to hit more than one of them i just want to let mike know that i love him and that i will wait for him to be released would you please play rick dees disco duck for the love of my life and let him know that i miss him every day sincerely tabitha
8222864 he revealed that it can be frightening to travel in an aircraft that suddenly loses compression

8222866 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating
8222867 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8222868 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves
8222869 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8222870 we will take action to ensure people have the opportunities information and incentives towards healthy living
8222871 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8222872 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8222873 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly
8222874 there is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue by being almost a form of regulation by proxy and would lack credibility
8222875 the pr sector hasnt been affected by the downturn so far
8222876 people now believe they have to communicate all the time regardless of economic conditions
8222877 our businesses have started the second half of the year well and this together with our continued emphasis on cost control leaves us well placed to meet our expectations for the full year
8222878 it is widely predicted that economic growth will slow in 2009 but our strategy of diversified group of businesses will protect us
8222879 well forward all of these to apple so that we can ensure that not only murderdrome but that any comic submitted to apple doesnt fall foul of the same censorship
8222880 the plan is to hold murderdrome and concentrate on our other titles which will be more apple friendly
8222881 pengepolitikken er overordnet hvor den skal v re og jeg mener at diskussionen om en renteneds ttelse i europa er for tidlig

8222888 hydrogen fuel cell cars from nine automakers completed a 13 day cross country trip this weekend aug 25rh 2008 in the first such mass u s crossing for vehicles powered by a zero emission technology still in its infancy
8222889 from portland maine to the los angeles coliseum were stretches without hydrogen fueling stations when the vehicles were carried on flatbed trucks the longest from rolla missouri to albuquerque new mexico
8222890 about 60 hydrogen stations in the united states and only two are open to the public without prior arrangement
8222891 included two hydrogen producers air products and linde which hope to become household names if hydrogen becomes a key to transportation
8222892 it is the duty of those serving the people in public place
8222893 to closely limit public expenditures to the actual needs of the government economically administered
8222894 because this bounds its right to exact tribute from the earnings of labor or the property of the citizen and because public extravagance begets extravagance among the people

8222911 sobald im westen die emotionale phase der reaktion auf moskaus entschluss vorbei ist werden dort viele einen erleichterungsseufzer aussto en weil sie verstehen werden dass dmitri medwedew ihnen freie hand gelassen und im grunde einen entscheidenden schritt zur herausbildung einer neuen weltordnung getan hat
8222912 zweifellos bietet das allen sowohl russland als auch dem westen neue m glichkeiten in der welt das wichtigste ist hier sich nicht von der au enpolitischen taktik und dem streben nach gegenseitiger bestrafung fortrei en zu lassen und nicht diese in der geschichte seltenen strategischen m glichkeiten zur umgestaltung der welt nach eigenem willen zu vers umen

8222917 the team have forgotten the match in liege it was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at anfield
8222918 for liverpool the champions league is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying i am always optimistic and i am convinced we will beat standard but there are no easy games in europe and we are aware that this match is not decided
8222919 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor
8222920 if we improve and play at our real level it will be very difficult for them liege are probably the hardest opponents we have faced in champions league qualifiers but we know we are better than them even though they played well in the first leg
8222921 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win the key is to be calm and confident in your team and the ability of your players we have the players who can win this type of game
8222922 that is a danger to be complacent but there is so much at stake it would be criminal not to be focused
8222923 it is either being in the group stages on friday or being out
8222924 anything can happen at that level because we had a very difficult first leg but it cannot be just because you were taking this game lightly the tie is not dead because you could see from the first leg how quickly we could score two goals from nothing
8222925 if sadness isnt even your temporary disposition it can feel somewhat 2d
8222926 my mother said son as far as i am concerned nothing in this life now gives me any pleasure
8222927 im pretty sure he wouldnt like what is going on in the game now with the fitness coaches taking over and prozones weights dieticians pasta and bananas but he would survive today definitely
8222928 he would stand up to the challenges although he might have been reluctant to move with the times on the scientific side but i bet sir alex ferguson would tell you it took a while to change his ways without forgetting what you are all about
8222929 brian clough would have adapted and made his mark at whatever club he was at because he knew his football and i think the modern day footballer would be able to put up with him players would love to play for him because he was different
8222930 one day he made us all get into a five a side goal so the whole forest first team was squashed in there like a big game of twister to this day i have no idea why but i thought it was brilliant
8222931 if someone did that today youd be thinking how has this lad got his a or pro licence but it was brilliant and i used to love the fact that when he came down to the training ground hed bring his dog you always knew when he was in because you saw his dog del boy
8222932 brian clough was a one off so lets not kid ourselves that wed copy him he did things off the cuff but he knew his football you dont win european cups and english titles unless you know your stuff
8222933 towards the end a lot of people were critical of him which was a disgrace he is sadly missed and left his mark at forest you go back there and still feel he is there
8222934 im really looking forward to it because i have so many great memories of what is a fabulous club im going there to beat forest though
8222935 they told me they know they want to get rid of samak thaksin and all their cronies but the problem is they dont seem to know what will happen if they do

8222987 the folks on the boat told me that they dont believe theyve ever been so warmly received by locals and really supported by the entire city from the parks department that was integral in things to the fire department the council members that came down it really was a good showing on behalf of hannibal
8222988 its been great in hannibal attendance was lots better than what we ever thought
8222989 great city great turnout over the weekend we had an incredible response from everybody a really big turnout
8222990 sometimes when you hit the small cities you dont expect that big of crowd so it was really great to see such a big crowd in a small city like this were going to moline next and thats a bigger city so you would have thought this kind of crowd wouldnt be here it would be up there
8222991 i think over 12 000 people went aboard and i dont know how many came down and left because the lines were too long and they just didnt feel they could wait it was hot and the lines were long but it was worth every minute that i stood in line i brought my grandkids down and we went through i was just very pleased with it
8222992 i thought we might see 5 000 people but the turnout was really amazing it was not just tri state folks but we saw people from kansas city st louis and indiana that drove over to see this
8222993 i think it proved that people are still looking for something to do right there at the end of the summer vacation season maybe its a good weekend right before labor day to have an event in hannibal maybe we could start an annual veterans event that weekend on top of that maybe well look at different historical items to bring in or different collections

8223117 paolo ha proseguito benedetto xvi appare collocato sulla frontiera di tre culture diverse e forse anche per questo era disponibile a feconde aperture universalistiche come si riveler nel corso della vita
8223118 il suo fu un atteggiamento di intolleranza qui ha aggiunto che si colloca levento di damasco
8223119 da quel momento in poi la sua vita cambi ed egli divent un apostolo instancabile del vangelo

8223159 i left my family at the airport got back to bangkok on another plane flew back to the set not knowing if i was going back into gunfire or tanks shooting and finished the movie
8223160 if there is any humanity and empathy in my work which i think there is i would rather owe it to her

8223181 as the warrants were bailable we also granted them bail on their furnishing a personal bond
8223182 i am writing to you to urge you to oppose an exemption for india from the rules of the 45 nation nuclear suppliers group nsg
8223183 as you know the nsg operates by consensus so by blocking such an exemption south africa can prevent grave damage being done to the international nuclear non proliferation regime
8223184 the us india nuclear agreement effectively grants india the privileges of nuclear weapons states nws despite the fact that india developed nuclear weapons outside the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt regime the agreement doesnt even require india to accept the same responsibilities as other states i e full scope iaea safeguards for non nws and a commitment from nws to negotiate in good faith for the elimination of nuclear weapons
8223185 it continues to produce highly enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons and retains the option to test nuclear weapons again in the future under these circumstances an exemption for india offers no benefits it will only serve to set back efforts for nuclear disarmament and undermine the international non proliferation regime
8223186 there are no plans that i know of to change the agreement but you know in life you never rule things out
8223187 but its obviously got to be something that both the united states and india can agree to if there were going to be changes
8223188 but ive heard no mention of a need to you know adjust the agreement in any way
8223189 were working very hard we would like to see this agreement come into fruition because its critically important for both the united states and india
8223190 and we are aware that the congressional clock is ticking and we are going to be consulting with other governments particularly governments in the nsg to try to move this process forward as quickly as we can
8223191 but theyre good questions and we think weve got good answers to those
8223192 we are aware that the clock is ticking but it is a very important agreement for both countries and we want to see it happen
8223193 well do our best to address those concerns as the indians are trying to do to address concerns that other governments may have about the agreement
8223194 the chief minister told the meeting that it is a daunting task to evacuate such a large number of people and providing them relief materials
8223195 i had written to the prime minister that i believe that the dispute in jammu and kashmir is between the separatists and nationalists not commenting on this only this he has written to me that i would like to assure you that the government will not bow down to separatist forces in taking decision
8223196 the state and the central governments have acted in a partisan manner on amarnath issue bjp demands that the land must be restored to shri amarnath shrine board the separatists should be hauled before law for challenging the sovereignty of the indian republic

8223221 when a wednesday which addresses itself to an issue thats close to mr modi as a politician was ready i wanted him to watch it i called him and requested him to do so
8223222 mr modis counter request was tell me the story in two lines i told him he immediately agreed then his staff got into action and a date was set
8223223 it the screening went off fabulously let me tell you media perceptions of mr modi are completely wrong he is misunderstood because he is outspoken he is a politician destined for very big things the good thing was he came with no prejudices and he brought his entire ministry and government machinery with him

8223231 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8223232 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8223233 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8223261 on a previous holiday i went to the central registry in london and found out a bit about him
8223262 i know he was called nicholas davies or davis and i know his parents were called joseph and frances davies frances was originally a procter
8223263 my great grandfather joseph was married twice nicholas was his son from his first marriage some years later he had another six or seven children to another woman called fanny i dont know what happened to frances as i couldnt find a death notice for her
8223264 i know that joseph and fanny had six children jane george mary john t edith and joseph
8223265 joseph was born in cockermouth in 1835 and fanny was born in 1846 in cliburn

8223275 choose from doctors at medical centres in london manchester birmingham glasgow or any other area
8223276 the deliberate abuse of the sick certification system is to be condemned
8223277 one positive step employers can take to avoid fraud is to strengthen working relationships with doctors
8223278 this will also help them take positive action to support employees with genuine long term health problems

8223296 there is a shortage of parking spaces in the square because pensioners from outlying areas are leaving their cars there while they pick up a free bus to carlisle
8223297 we would welcome the opportunity to discuss such a facility as i can see that there could be some benefits for all parties concerned
8223298 we do have additional land within our ownership outwith the application site and it may be that this could come into play

8223302 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8223303 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again
8223304 the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20 degrees and it rains rains rains
8223305 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather
8223306 in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for other less rainy cities
8223307 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8223308 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8223309 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8223310 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all
8223311 it was much easier for me to adapt to russia than england in england i had no one to talk to

8223313 the more people let these kids get away with it the more they will do it these kids need to have respect there is a lack of it in this country these days communities need to stand up for themselves the more people that do then the more these children will realise that they cannot get away with their actions
8223314 i was sat on the computer and saw him out of the corner of my eye
8223315 he was flicking his chips with his fork on to the pavement outside the gate
8223316 i was telling him to shift through the window i then went to the front door and told him to go away
8223317 they were making threats and said they would be back then they disappeared
8223318 i went outside and the next thing i knew one of them went behind my back and hit me on the head with something i thought it was a bottle at first
8223319 these children could be carrying anything these days but if you stopped and thought about it they would ride roughshod over everyone they thought that they could do want they wanted whenever they wanted
8223320 their actions will not be tolerated i am sure there are people who could assist us in our inquiries and i would appeal to them to get in touch

8223335 try to stand in the shoes of your ceo his fate depends heavily on the company s stock performance and stock performance depends on shareholders perception and the external auditors opinion not information security or better it governance
8223336 every three months the ceo has to disclose to the company s shareholders that based on his knowledge the financial statements and other financial information fairly present in all material respects the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company
8223337 after reading this report based on his knowledge there are massive problems to the internal controls that protect the financial information from unauthorized modification and to make things worse the company s staff cannot handle them he has the obligation to disclose the problems to thepublic and this disclosure will definitely not increase shareholder value or his compensation in fact he will lose money as he has stock options that give him the right to buy a stock from the company at a certain price at a future date

8223352 i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins
8223353 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8223354 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8223355 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8223356 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8223357 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8223358 a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization
8223359 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8223360 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8223361 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8223362 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
8223363 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8223364 i would say that as long as senator bidens stated position on abortion remains the same then it would apply to senator biden whether he was a senator or the vice president of any type of public figure

8223367 i opened a ticket with ea support and they said that it is an
8223368 the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8223369 if you ask those former clinton voters who they want to be for barack obama or john mccain they would say barack obama overwhelmingly
8223370 were all worried because we should as a party be doing better
8223371 i am so freaking proud of her i cant stand it she is the leader of my life but she just gave me my marching orders barack won the election
8223372 there is no sense that the party has a sense of urgency
8223373 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual but its a lousy soundbite
8223374 john mccain says the economy is fundamentally sound john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis
8223375 with an agenda like that it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities because these days theyre awfully hard to tell apart
8223376 if john mccain has his way your bills will continue to grow and your paycheck will continue to shrink
8223377 in an obama biden administration american families will finally get a new deal for a new economy a tax cut they earned healthcare they can afford a pension they can keep and a college education they deserve
8223378 the convention is about getting american voters particularly swing voters to know barack obama and become comfortable with him
8223379 by far the most pro equality platform in democratic history
8223380 makes very clear our party rejects discrimination including very explicitly discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity
8223381 gay and lesbian families in the life of our nation
8223382 divisive effort to politicize the constitution by pursuing a federal marriage amendment
8223383 oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
8223384 it is wrong to deny our country the service of brave qualified
8223385 and the implementation of policies to allow qualified men and women to serve openly regardless of sexual orientation
8223386 will fight to end discrimination based on race sexual orientation gender identity in every corner of our country because thats the america we believe in
8223387 children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and are more likely to commit crime drop out of school abuse drugs and end up in prison
8223388 i hope i can tell you more about it at hot chips next year

8223416 he got his reward for an excellent year when he was called up for the south africa tour and im sure that the experience will be of immense benefit for him this year as he looks to push on to the next level
8223417 its obvious to everybody at the ospreys that there are great things happening here weve got a quality squad and great coaches theres a real buzz about the place and were confident about our chances for the new season
8223418 last season was a fantastic one for me personally i really made my mark in the side had plenty of game time made the wales squad and now i want to build on that over the next four years
8223419 there are plenty of good centres at the ospreys so i cant take anything for granted but the situation is that the competition for places will benefit me the ospreys and will benefit wales

8223659 the longer term challenge for companies is to move away from testing quality into the product to building quality into the product which requires addressing the entire software development process not just bug fixing at the end
8223660 from experience it is much cheaper to capture the bugs or security vulnerabilities earlier in the software development tools
8223661 using a combination of automated code generation and world class tools development environments and methodologies any mistake can be rectified within the time and cost envelope
8223662 the reason companies are increasingly looking to service providers to assist with this is that they dont have the internal capability to address this issue and believe they need specialists to assist with improving their testing capability initially and to help them improve their overall software development processes and methodology in the long run
8223663 with things like soa it becomes a challenge how to even test something since some parts of the architecture may actually be out of the enterprises control and access from a testing perspective

8223668 the war in chechnya is a war of liberation it engaged in terrorist activities but it is fundamentally different
8223669 there has been a shift in islam that i believe is connected to the failures of governments and the failures of the west to work with many of these countries in order to make sure that opportunities are there that theres bottom up economic growth

8223729 what scraps of credibility abdullah had left after march 8 are gone
8223730 it is time to face the music it is we who have been buried
8223731 what happened was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8223732 so that abdullah will realize that his leadership is no longer wanted
8223733 with anwar ibrahim in parliament we cannot afford to have a weak leadership because it could lead to our downfall

8223739 usually when there is rainfall in kerala we are able to generate good wind power but this time as it is raining in tamil nadu wind power has been affected the forecast is that the situation would continue for the next two days or more
8223740 even if we overdraw a single mw it will collapse hence we have no option but to impose load shedding in the night too
8223741 the demand is still 9 200 mw but we are not generating enough power to meet the demand
8223742 we can expect 500 mw from these units the rainfall is also not good

8223750 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8223751 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8223752 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
8223753 with the federal government not investing not setting good regulatory mechanisms and basically taking a back seat on everything except drilling and fossil fuels the grid has not been modernized especially for wind energy

8223782 we have yet to receive an offer for james that matches our valuation
8223783 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract here

8223789 for too long too many south africans have sought to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory we must therefore ensure that we turn around this negative sentiment which may lead to our numerous victories being unacknowledged
8223790 the action for a safe south africa campaign goes to the heart of the society that we envisage it is only when we can enjoy freedom without fear that the rights espoused in our constitution will have meaning for the majority of south africans
8223791 the process was so slick and speedy a more cynical person might conclude that the whole thing was planned and expertly stage managed
8223792 that is why we vote for them we do not expect them to vote tactically
8223793 these councillors have not long been elected think of the damage they could do to rct before the next election
8223794 i believe this whole process was flawed and i think a judicial review is called for rest assured that our action group rawt will be looking into this matter
8223795 now the decision has been made it would be very difficult to refuse a future wind farm application

8223809 im hopefully going to win the x factor to prove to my real family that im not a waste of space and to prove myself to my foster parent and make her proud of me

8223811 we can categorically deny that alan has ever made up any story relating to his past and both the show and alan refute all claims made
8223812 alan has at no point apologised to producers and his position in the show has never been in jeopardy
8223813 when he came out with a statement that he was put into foster care at the age of four he didnt know who we were i just found the whole thing absolutely bizarre
8223814 i just didnt know where the lad was coming from
8223815 i feel humbled that the voters voted for me and we got the support that we did get

8223823 were not making anything happen right now were just hoping weve got to make things happen not sit back

8223836 weve fallen into this false sense of urgency that they create

8223846 we asked 25 people and not one of them knew who was throwing the party
8223847 that was one of the more interesting things weve done asking whats the relationship between the party and lobbyists
8223848 the obama campaign is friendly they know we often drive the media talking points
8223849 a couple of people i talked to in the georgia delegation said even if hillary releases her delegates they still plan to vote for her on the first ballot
8223850 obama needs to be delicate with clinton supporters because he doesnt need to lose 18 million votes to lose the election just a fraction of that
8223851 somebody in that office said they didnt think they could win the county they just want to get as many votes across the state as possible if obama gets 48 percent ill be impressed im pegging it at 45 percent
8223852 truthfully i couldve been happy with either barack or hillary

8223868 whilst conditions are likely to remain tough in both the uk and the u s in the short term we are maintaining momentum in the uk and we have seen pockets of stabilization in the u s
8223869 i have to say that while this is the worst year ever for chinas petrochemical sector the worst is still not yet past

8223872 we just hired one new bus driver so were hiring staff and making sure we have bus drivers to get people where they need to be
8223873 there is no such thing as a free two week period where no one gets cited
8223874 generally when students are cited they just have to pay the fine but risk the chance of getting a hold placed on their record if they dont pay
8223875 and if we take good care of students rights we become part of their extended family
8223876 to be in the thick of being part of the conversation determining how the university is going to run thats very exciting
8223877 the senate picks up an issue where there is vagueness and tries to solidify it and make it clear
8223878 it is a co governance model where administration students and faculty run the university as a joint project
8223879 most of them felt like they had done what they needed to do and they were frustrated when they received the letter
8223880 and some were very delighted when they found out they would in fact be admitted
8223881 that if these students really wanted to come here lets see what we can do
8223882 we filled up a lot sooner and our numbers increased a lot sooner than they have in the past
8223883 that does not mean that they wont be assigned a space
8223884 it just means as soon as there is a cancel they will have a place
8223885 i think it is a powerful way to communicate a step further
8223886 it definitely supports different ways to get the message across

8223892 its yearlong recruiting but this is just so that we can stand out and let people get to know us

8223894 it seems like a great deal of them are actually interested in greek life which is refreshing
8223895 we used up our whole stock of barbecue meat for two weeks in one night
8223896 we had a barbecue last night at 7 and at 7 05 we had maybe almost 100 people there
8223897 we have barbecues every year but this barbecue went from 7 to like 11 30 people coming in and out from what i heard every house was like that
8223898 at first theyre just strangers but over the rush you really get to meet all these new faces it makes you appreciate when you were in their position and you didnt know anyone and you got to meet new people and make new friends
8223899 i think its good for the freshman to have a nice display of all the different sororities and fraternities and they have a nice chance to talk to them

8223903 modeled on a mayan corbelled arch combined with mission colonial arches this site pays tribute to chavezs respective spanish and indigenous roots while referencing the conquest the plaza is treated with colors derived from the pre hispanic codices while the arch is finished with a pearlescent white to create a sensibility of reflective light within the architecture

8224049 there is a general air of satisfaction with the senior hurling selectors who were initially appointed for a two year term
8224050 thats the one thing we might have to think about but it would be cover because our two goalkeepers have shown already this season that they can play at this level
8224051 hes jones waiting to see a specialist but hes pretty optimistic and doesnt feel its as bad as the injury he had last year on the other hand
8224052 were having a think about whether weve got enough in terms of the squad
8224053 there may be areas that we feel we may need a bit more cover but weve got a very close knit squad and everyone is involved
8224054 theres not tens of millions but if as a club we feel something is right then were in a position to do that
8224055 the manner in which we made the changes did not affect the way we approached the game and played the game
8224056 it showed that we have got some strength in depth and i am delighted we got the crowd we did as it reflects both on us getting the ticket prices right and the type of football we play is attracting people to come
8224057 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8224058 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park
8224059 he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8224060 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of the player
8224061 however should such an offer be received then the club would be reluctantly forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave

8224069 what do you think michelle obama thinks about hillary clinton
8224070 but the networks cant not be here which is a problem not a terrific amount of news is going to happen we have to be here in case something does happen its the same reason we send reporters down to crawford to sit there during the presidents vacation in case something does happen

8224089 pardon me who said that i dont think i heard you clearly
8224090 im sorry i dont know your name yet but would you please get your stuff and go this is not going to work out
8224091 im not joking i dont care what kind of language you use in your own life but in this classroom any reasonable person knows that disrespecting me and this class is not going to work
8224092 im sorry this didnt work out but there are a number of other sections of this class and youll be able to transfer to one of them
8224093 i have a student complaint first day and already a complaint do you know a student named zzzzzzzz aaaaaaaa
8224094 i know his names on my roster but i couldnt tell you for sure which one he is yet
8224095 he tells me you kicked him out of class without provocation this morning
8224096 oh i know who he is he said fuck that in my class twice actually im not teaching him let him register in someone elses class
8224097 you have to take him back itd be best if you took him back
8224098 theres a student complaining about being kicked out of class and dr yyyyyy tells me you wont take him back
8224099 no that young man is not going to be in my class i dont want to be subjected to it and the other 29 students shouldnt have to put up with it either
8224100 im uri the union guy and we better get our ducks in a row
8224101 if i have to fight to keep a job like that its not worth fighting for
8224102 if i got the student to apologize would you teach the class
8224103 ive spoken to the young mans mother and she thinks hell apologize
8224104 she thinks he might apologize do you think wed be so lucky
8224105 we are here to make sure veterans issues are at the forefront of the national political dialog
8224106 were not for or against the war were not trying to get anybody elected were simply trying to take care of those veterans coming back from iraq and afghanistan
8224107 i know of a west point grad who suffered through several ied attacks
8224108 and although he was never wounded when we came back he was suffering from memory loss and losing the sense of smell and when he went to the va they told him you got a concussion when you were playing football at west point and they denied him his health care
8224109 were here to engage delegates and others to talk about what we saw and why we remain committed to victory in iraq
8224110 we recognize the success and gains that have been made not just militarily but politically its about sharing our perspective which we believe is underrepresented here
8224111 mccain has made it very clear that he wants to make sure that the gains weve made are not squandered
8224112 what bothers me when we talk about veterans on this side of the aisle its always about victimization we can talk about ptsd or traumatic brain injuries without suggesting that these folks had nothing better to do with their lives its offensive
8224113 i think theres a lot more common ground with the clinton supporters because she was tougher on national security issues
8224114 biden to his credit has had a bit more responsible take on iraq
8224115 some republicans say obama cant lead because he has not served a day in uniform
8224116 one of the marine corps principles is know your troops and look after their welfare i think barack obamas service in the neighborhoods of chicago translates perfectly to the service he would be able to give as commander in chief
8224117 while its true that republicans tend to claim the support of the troops there are many troops and veterans around the country who are ready for a change in leadership that looks out for them first
8224118 i think the biggest distinction between the two candidates is that barack obama respects the troops
8224119 he wants to give them a plan to win in the long term and not focus on continuing the policies that have failed to produce any lasting peace in iraq or afghanistan weve had some success but we need a plan not just more of the same
8224120 were not doing this for ourselves none of us want a job out of this
8224121 were in this because we know this is the most important thing for the united states and our national security
8224122 i think about it a lot but im still thinking
8224123 what i know is i want the president to strongly support the troops and their families
8224124 there are people that support mccain because he is military and supports the war or theyre supporting obama because he wants to pull the troops out of iraq im a little surprised more dont support mccain
8224125 youre there to serve and when you get the call you serve

8224127 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson
8224128 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
8224129 if you were a son of mine i wouldnt want you to be an architect because its a tough way to be in the world
8224130 its just like if you can speak to somebody in their own language
8224131 we never forget that our role is to serve families and their selected charities
8224132 when i originally had the skyhouse under contract i also had a one bedroom under contract
8224133 and when we decided to terminate the skyhouse we decided to upgrade to a two bedroom
8224134 i want the place to be very contemporary very zenlike
8224135 barbara kruger a lot of barbara kruger some fashion photography
8224136 keith always has a say he has to sign the check so he always has a say but he trusts me
8224137 and we decided that we wanted to be even higher
8224138 and i said lets go sky diving stephanie was like i dont know ive never done it before
8224139 we didnt go to sleep the whole day making it very crazy and it was like 10 a m before we actually jumped and the sun was in the middle of the sky and you could see all the way across long island it was a crystal clear day and all the way to the city almost
8224140 i know all these people now theyre like were going sky diving tomorrow
8224141 its just that everything is a little bit over the top
8224142 i walk into parties sometimes and its like did they import these people did they hire these people to come to this party like the gossip girl party last weekend i walk in its their premiere party everyone is dressed the same everyone looks like theyre one of the gossip girls and it was weird because everyone looked the same
8224143 and its like this summer were like in a recession
8224144 the decision to initiate the share repurchase program illustrates the confidence we have in the long term value of our company and reiterates our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns

8224147 during the second quarter we continued to focus on advancing our long term goals while managing the business in an ongoing challenging retail environment while sales and earnings were impacted by reduced store traffic and increased promotional activity across our industry our expenses and inventory were well controlled as we emphasized cost discipline and our freshness and velocity strategies at the same time we continued to invest in our brands our stores and infrastructure in support of our long term growth
8224148 to this end we announced plans to implement a new enterprise resource planning system to transform the information technology infrastructure for our integrated business model we made significant progress on the transition of famous footwear to st louis and we continued to improve our product design competencies across our brands we believe these initiatives along with the diversification and growth from new brand launches such as fergie and our partnership with vera wang to design and market her lavender label collection will enable brown shoe to become a stronger more resilient company in the future even so we are taking a cautious approach to the back half of 2008 by appropriately reducing guidance and tightening our standards for capital management as a result we now expect 90 new store openings for famous footwear for the year versus our original plan of 130 while we expect the retail environment to remain uncertain we believe we are in a position of strength and expect to win market share while executing to our long term strategic goals

8224151 they are a very talented team people may say that fcs isnt as good as fbs but this team proves that isnt the case there are a lot of playmakers on this team it is going to be a tough task we are going into the game and looking at it as the hardest game of the year
8224152 we look at everything as our last first practice our last jersey scrimmage and our last first game we just want to take it all in and enjoy it this is all we have left for our collegiate career
8224153 i cant wait for saturday to get the first kick out of the way im looking for straight hard balls down the middle it doesnt matter if theyre 20 yards or 60 yards one point or three points
8224154 its amazing how a guy can go to the nfl just for holding he holds the ball perfect no matter how the ball comes back i think hes the best holder in the world and a tremendous athlete
8224155 it was not one of my best games i learned a lot from the first time we played youngstown state last year i felt like i rushed everything i was anxious with it being the first game im anxious this year but i know not to rush everything
8224156 we want to stay focused and perform on any given saturday any team can win regardless of conference or division
8224157 when youre not a starter you know that youre not going to be out on the field the entire game when youre a starter you know that you have to give 110 percent from start to finish i was nervous last year playing ysu because it was my first time as a starter but now im comfortable with being a starter because i trust the guys around me
8224158 we have a lot of seniors this year that are ready to go out and play we want to lead this team to another big ten championship and the national championship it all starts with the first game well play youngstown state this saturday and take it from there
8224159 i cant wait to see the young guys play itll be interesting to see how they handle of crowd of 104 000 people cheering theyve shown a lot in practice all of them show that theyre willing to learn and ready to play
8224160 theres just a whole different feel especially with this being your last time your time is limited
8224161 this is the only place i want to be i feel very blessed to be here
8224162 on any given saturday any team can win and you have to have that mentality we need to get the jitters out and set the tone for the rest of the season
8224163 you never really get used to running out of the tunnel at ohio stadium if it doesnt get you a little shaky then there is something wrong with you
8224164 we are very excited to hit somebody other than ourselves weve been hitting each other for a long time we just want to take it one game at a time but we think we should be able to take care of business
8224165 they bring it every time they mark this on their calenders they will bring everything theyve got you cant underestimate these guys because theyll come in and beat you

8224168 oh jesus come into me and save me from this bad time and season which is going to take me away
8224169 from july 1 to date we are down about 85 percent compared to last summer
8224170 at the beginning of the year there was a sense that the market would weaken
8224171 now it appears that the long anticipated slowdown is occurring
8224172 third quarter is going to shape up to be the slowest of all the quarters this year
8224173 as we start to see things decline then well see more tenants ready to move and the landlords will also start to move to lock in high quality tenants

8224176 it got to the point last year where we had depleted almost all of new york of crab and lobster
8224177 our fish purveyors had to go to secondary markets outside of new york just to get it
8224178 we have five different restaurants not including the dining rooms for the players the umpires and media
8224179 goldman has been a little countercyclical like shorting the whole credit market when things were falling apart
8224180 now they seem to be bracing for the cmbs market to recover
8224181 the talk on the street is anywhere from 12 to 24 months
8224182 the market is still difficult the buyers of those bonds have not resurfaced to any large degree
8224183 this is a clich but this is the time when the men are separated from the boys
8224184 this market i hate to say it separates the men from the boys the strong from the weak
8224185 if you dont make deals after six to 12 months its hard to keep going
8224186 you have retail brokers trying to do office office brokers trying to do retail instead of remaining specialized
8224187 the asking salary ranges have definitely dropped people who were asking 125 000 a year might be asking for under a hundred now we can get better people than we thought we could get

8224196 if theres one thing we all learned again from the recent bigfoot fiasco its that if people leak blurry crappy looking photos as evidence theyre probably fake especially given the superb quality of digital cameras these days
8224197 wenn wir etwas aus dem letzten bigfoot fiasco gelernt haben wenn jemand verschwommene bilder mit schlechter qualit t als beweisfotos vorbringt dann sind diese vermutlich gef lscht vor allem wenn man bedenkt wie hoch die qualit t der heutigen digital kameras ist

8224233 if lymphostat b is successful in phase 3 we believe that it could represent a breakthrough in the treatment of patients suffering from sle
8224234 we have now completed enrollment in both of our lymphostat b phase 3 trials we are on track to have data from our first phase 3 trial by mid 2009 and data from our second phase 3 trial by fall 2009 assuming positive results we anticipate a bla filing in the united states in the first half of 2010
8224235 the bliss studies are the largest double blinded clinical trials ever conducted in lupus
8224236 there is a significant need for new and more effective treatments for these patients and we look forward to having the belimumab phase 3 results available in 2009
8224237 the belimumab clinical investigators have done a tremendous job in completing the randomization and initial dosing of bliss 52 and bliss 76 on our original timeline despite the size and complexity of these studies
8224238 they have enrolled nearly 1700 patients worldwide into these phase 3 trials we are one step closer to results that we hope will confirm belimumabs potential to offer a significant new treatment option for patients with sle
8224239 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors

8224247 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8224248 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8224249 we never have a weak august it is supposed to be one of the strongest months of the year it is not a good indicator that the market is down in the strongest season of the year
8224250 if you look at rents here they are incredibly higher than elsewhere there is still low inventory and what is renting is going very quickly
8224251 it was reassuring that to show this is what i can do and this is what im here for
8224252 im sure he was going through some sore points with his foot and rightfully so
8224253 the great players they want to prove to their team that theyre good he hasnt had a chance to show a whole lot yet i promise you mentally inside hes thinking i want to do well and he did that does wonders for somebody
8224254 you saw that explosion through the line and then that extra gear he hit when he ran away from the safety
8224255 hes one of the most dominating receivers in my eyes in this league
8224256 to have him come and give you props is something special i wouldnt have told you a year ago or six months ago that steve smith would be meeting me in the end zone
8224257 pick up somewhat in the second half of this year
8224258 he just destroyed the field last year blew the race into a thousand pieces and he basically replicated that ride that he did at univest last year in a stage of the tour de france
8224259 i am going to miss playing for the club greatly
8224260 i would firstly like to thank allah for providing me with this great family this is a very hard decision for me to make as i feel that i could possibly play one more year but out of respect i would only do that if i felt 100 percent and i wouldnt want to risk that for the family
8224261 i am truly honoured to have spent six wonderful years here
8224262 my love my feelings and my heart will always be with sussex and i will always pray to allah for continued success at sussex
8224263 mushtaqs legacy at the club is that he leaves us statistically romantically and emotionally the best player to ever pull on a sussex shirt
8224264 in view of the impact hes made its difficult to think of another cricketer who has achieved or done more for one county his legacy extends beyond the playing arena as im sure all that have been graced by his presence will agree he is simply a great man
8224265 i dont think that it will ever be possible to overplay the enormous influence mushtaq has had on sussex in recent years
8224266 i want everyone to know that i asked for 600 million in cuts
8224267 speaker silver brought us 800 million in cuts that could have taken us further than we were and the only thing that stood between us and those deductions was the new york state senate do you hear me senator malcolm smith next year we dont want to have this problem
8224268 hes being very forceful in the way hes speaking up
8224269 he didnt go through histrionics but he got the legislature to do essentially what he wanted and what needs to be done i think hes been very forceful so far and hes very much growing into an outstanding player in the role
8224270 leadership is not just rah rah its also giving people news that they dont want to hear to the extent that they can stand it and i think thats what he did for us
8224271 there was bad news but it was bad news that we could bring back to people where they could hear what we were saying
8224272 based on current numbers there is most likely insufficient demand for the m3 csl
8224273 if you think those guys have chemistry i think we have chemistry
8224274 it was one meeting at which we were going to discuss several things and one was to be a surprise
8224275 she said nobody knows this please dont share this with the press
8224276 its extremely surprising that broadway boulevard got done as quickly as it did
8224277 in the whole history of dot projects this has probably moved the fastest of anything i have ever seen
8224278 weve got 6 000 miles of streets and over 12 000 miles of sidewalks and were trying to look at making them livable spaces and not just these utilitarian corridors
8224279 so when you take a look at the streets of new york thats 80 percent of our public space in some ways i think of myself as the largest real estate developer in new york
8224280 within the world of basketball within those trail blazers teams he was a jokester
8224281 he was a big loving teddy bear at times guys got frustrated because he didnt have a mean streak he was just a great guy he loved the team atmosphere loved being a teammate in those successful blazer teams
8224282 kevin will be remembered by fans as one of the most popular and recognizable players to ever wear the blazers uniform but to people who knew him hell be remembered as one of the warmest and biggest hearted
8224283 you wake up in the morning and its your first news of the day it just kind of hits you
8224284 for me i spent so much time with that young man and had so much success with him it really hurt its almost like losing a brother
8224285 in her own way she was a part of the team
8224286 its such a hard thing because she was so special and she did touch so many people
8224287 from those in her school to those in her neighborhood to those on the team to canes fans she touched so many
8224288 its just hard to deal with especially for her parents no question it was a long fight for her
8224289 its really heart breaking for someone so young to go so early
8224290 its always sad to see a young kid go through that she had to go through
8224291 to me the thing thats most sad is she was in tough shape for a long time
8224292 i cant speak for her family but what we did in 2006 had to have helped her have something to look forward to other than just constantly worrying about what she was going through obviously our thoughts now are with her parents they have been suffering for a long time
8224293 the influence she had on our team especially during the stanley cup run was second to none
8224294 i think in her own way she helped us win the stanley cup
8224295 a lot of times you can start focusing on how rough and tough it is and then coach laviolette brought julia rowe into our lives then you knew what was really tough if she could battle that we could battle through a seventh game or whatever we had to face
8224296 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8224297 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8224298 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8224299 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8224300 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8224301 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8224302 the proposed agreement recognizes and rewards coach holtz for all he and his family have done for ecu athletics and the entire community
8224303 it is our intention to encourage them to stay with us a long long time
8224304 he works a lot with our sga student government association and is known throughout the school
8224305 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8224306 i think at the moment its a lot to ask for
8224307 we work in the heat of the day up here the heat of the day up here is probably the cool time down there
8224308 were rolling along trying to get their legs back now where theyre fresher
8224309 the airs pretty thin up here so i think it would be better for us when we get off the mountain
8224310 i think one thing we can feed off of is the adrenaline flow when you play in that stadium
8224311 theyre a typical southeastern conference football team big and fast and very very athletic supremely well coached theyre probably one of the best tackling football teams ive ever seen
8224312 the size and athletic factors versus those of our players are just at different levels but were going to waste a lot of time down there if we dont play hard thats the thing that were trying to drive home
8224313 we know they like to blitz a lot and we have to get rid of the ball quick and capitalize when they do blitz
8224314 we dont want to run up the middle with them so we have to try to keep it outside and make them chase us
8224315 i still dont know how its going to feel swinging
8224316 im being a little tentative to do so im going to give it a couple more days its definitely taken some good steps forward in the past week a lot less pain in the last week
8224317 for the long term and for the good of the program this is in our best interest
8224318 tyrod wanted to redshirt and we are trying to do what is in his best interest for him
8224319 my biggest concern right now is how many people we can get inside that fence to watch the football game next saturday
8224320 and i thought well you know i dont have to move and maybe this is gonna be a first class thing
8224321 if i could have gotten a job at duke or even carolina or east carolina someplace in this area i would have taken the job but i didnt get any so this came up and im glad i didnt get any of those jobs this is fun
8224322 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8224323 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8224324 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8224325 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8224326 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8224327 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8224328 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8224329 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8224330 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8224331 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8224332 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8224333 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8224334 now winning a pole doesnt mean anything being in that race has always been a big bonus for the teams shame on nascar it should have sold the whole thing to coors and not mickey moused around with a half and half deal its disappointing it has turned out the way it did
8224335 if i were somebody who might be adversely affected i wouldnt be too happy about it
8224336 but change occurs and we will move forward with it
8224337 it is performance driven all of our teams have the opportunity to be one of top six in that brand
8224338 playing good defense has a lot with how you do on offense
8224339 if our offense is able to control the ball if we make people go a long way to score points against our defense then we have the potential to be good
8224340 knowing where to be at and knowing where everybody else is going to be on the field
8224341 thats all you can really ask for come out and play fast
8224342 big plays are a result of a missed tackle or mental mistake
8224343 someone in the wrong place playing the wrong coverage thats a big emphasis of ours no gifts
8224344 its hard for a guy my size to sneak in a room
8224345 weve done a lot of hyping and talking senior receiver eron riley said
8224346 we have to go out there now make plays and show people what we are talking about
8224347 with all the optimism around campus all the promotions if we dont put on a good show for the fans itll be same old duke riley said
8224348 the biggest thing to begin with was just to generate the interest and have real expectations cutcliffe said tuesday
8224349 thank goodness there are expectations i like that ive never been afraid of expectations we welcome the challenge the administration has declared that they want to change the culture of football at duke and we are taking that seriously
8224350 obviously i know the importance of playing well people coming back and people believing
8224351 he does a pretty good job and gospel thats his niche
8224352 his pass rushing is above average hes strong as an ox and straight ahead fast we are trying to get him to play at that peak speed all the time
8224353 when he came on his visit we had a nice long discussion about him
8224354 and i think he made some mistakes he owned up to his mistakes and he wanted another opportunity
8224355 to build those 150 homes we need the help of the american people we need to all join together to do this there is no reason why we cant do a thousand homes
8224356 there is no reason why we cant do a thousand homes

8224382 its very dangerous there are other objectives that one can suppose are the objectives of russia in particular crimea ukraine and moldova
8224383 while russia sent aid to flood hit ukrainian regions ukraine failed to help russia to force georgia to peace and took an openly hostile stance
8224384 moscow has acted brutally in georgia but when the united states and britain backed the independence of kosovo without un approval they paved the way for russias defence of south ossetia and for the current western humiliation

8224395 we dont think the credit cycle has bottomed out yet
8224396 we expect that banks and thrifts will keep building up reserves for the next several quarters
8224397 the tax will fall most heavily on the weakest so the conclusion is the weak are going to get weaker and the strong will be able to take advantage of the weak
8224398 the numbers are alarming but we are coming off of an incredibly low base of problem institutions and failures
8224399 this is nowhere near what we had seen during prior periods of weakness are we done i dont think anyone would predict that we have a ways to go

8224429 the two hijackers and the seven crew are still inside we are continuing to negotiate with them
8224430 we are condemning first the hijacking of a civilian aeroplane and we are now in continuous contact and consultation with the libyan authorities in kufra airport
8224431 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8224432 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8224433 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8224434 is a true leader of a rebellion of the resistance in darfur who says that he does not know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use these methods

8224449 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
8224450 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life
8224451 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way how can anyone be this narcissistic you wonder in disbelief in appalled fascination after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

8224454 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
8224455 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

8224463 with regards to pakistan presidency that is really very much an internal pakistani matter the pakistanis will have to determine who their next president will be
8224464 the relationship between the united states and pakistan is very important we are engaged in very serious efforts to battle extremism in both pakistan and afghanistan and we look forward to continuing our co operation with the current government in battling extremism
8224465 no our message to pakistan is very clear that they are an important ally we need to work together on a wide range of issues
8224466 he dominated cricket for 20 years from his debut in 1928 to his retirement 60 years ago this month and if he had not lost eight years of his career to world war ii his figures would no doubt be better still at every olympics plenty of records are broken bradman remains unassailable
8224467 as a team we do try and score at least 300 runs a day in test cricket
8224468 in honour of bradmans legacy thats the least we can do
8224469 im still in touch with the jacksons and this is something that will happen due to some problems theyve had to postpone that and concentrate on other things
8224470 once they iron out all their current problems theyll move forward with that its still on the cards
8224471 financially theyre doing fine theyre not the multi millionaires that they used to be but theyre all doing fine
8224472 if i ever hear ian healy or someone say sledging has been going on forever im going to refer him to the video of the invincibles there wasnt a word out of place for the whole tour
8224473 if bradman could come back today and see whats happening in the game of cricket i think hed be terribly disappointed
8224474 when i heard about ricky ponting delivering the bradman oration i thought to myself dear oh dear oh well thats the way they do things these days
8224475 council made its decision based on 100 per cent planning grounds council believes its made the right decision on those grounds for the specific site
8224476 his name is a by word for brilliance soccer has pele cricket has bradman no name in cricket conjures up such widespread awe and respect as that of sir donald bradman
8224477 even people with just a passing knowledge of the game or in countries where he never played will invariably recognise the name bradman as a by word for brilliance that name says all that is best about the game and it is synonymous with cricket soccer has pele and cricket has bradman
8224478 even now 60 years after his final test match and with time to put his achievements into context his batting average of 99 94 still seems scarcely believable especially when one compares it to those of the many other players to have graced the game at the highest level
8224479 we should also remember the way he gave back to the game after he finished playing as a selector and as an administrator with the australian cricket board and the imperial cricket conference
8224480 sir donalds life was a lifetime of service to cricket and his legacy is that our strong sport continues to grow stronger
8224481 you are my lord youre my darling youre my orgy my charming prince i am yours i who always sought fire am burning for you like a pagan woman

8224483 we couldnt believe the results of this research in fact we were amazed so many of us are so snoopy the daily telegraph quoted virgin mobile pr manager amber morris as saying
8224484 in a society where we very rarely let our mobile phones out of our sight its quite amazing to think that for a lot of us the minute we jump in the shower someone might be checking up on us
8224485 i can absolutely say that pretty well all the patients showed a statistical increase in their general health status and their overall well being the quantitative scales and as for the qualitative feedback more than 90 per cent was positive we do think there could be potential for psychological therapy but the research is all preliminary
8224486 we hope well have sufficient data to show there really is a valuable role that museums can play in health care and to then provide a tool kit for saying what is the best practice for engagement between museums and hospitals
8224487 strongly believes people should be able to consume alcohol when theyre 18 according to iu spokesman larry macintyre mike leonard wrote a commentary on the topic that was published on sunday
8224488 in 1984 congress voted to penalize any state that set its legal drinking age lower than 21 by rescinding 10 percent of that states federal highway funding
8224489 the study results show that current australian guidelines for prescribing antibiotics for pneumonia are appropriate
8224490 the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the biggest threats to australian health care standards and is closely linked to the inappropriate use of antibiotics
8224491 by using the broad spectrum antibiotics less often we can also prolong the effective lifespan of these drugs furthermore in the us canada and some parts of europe they are seeing some serious complications which appear to be related to the overuse of some classes of broad spectrum antibiotics that are frequently used there to treat respiratory infections
8224492 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8224493 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8224494 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8224495 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8224496 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8224497 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there

8224499 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8224500 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8224501 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8224502 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8224503 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8224504 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8224505 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
8224506 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
8224507 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
8224508 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
8224509 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
8224510 liberals it has been said are generous with other peoples money except when it comes to questions of national survival when they prefer to be generous with other peoples freedom and security
8224511 there are some local union presidents that are afraid yes thats the word afraid to hand out literature for barack obama
8224512 the presumption at the time was that we are driving biodiversity to lower levels
8224513 certainly if you think about it at the global level this is true because humans have done a lot of things that have driven species extinct
8224514 what dov and i worked on a few years ago is the fact that the vast majority of introductions of species dont have large negative effects
8224515 indeed most species that get introduced dont have much effect at all it doesnt mean that theyre not altering the ecosystem but theyre not driving things extinct like some of the big poster child stories weve been hearing about
8224516 the dramatic increase in the number of species has changed how the system functions
8224517 changing the abundance of natives versus exotics affects all of the other species that used to depend on the natives for food or shelter so its not in any way to say that increasing biodiversity is a good thing
8224518 in the case of birds lots of extinctions no change in total biodiversity
8224519 my friend and i are blogging about our cleanse we are both on day 3 we post about twice a day and hold nothing back anywho check it out
8224520 there was a cctv system at the property which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days
8224521 the house a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead and two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing
8224522 a search of the property will be carried out to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe
8224523 when i saw chris a few days ago he seemed happy but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch
8224524 he used to have two porsches and an aston martin and he goes shooting and fishing in his spare time
8224525 valencio listed off the numbers of unionists murdered in colombia like he was reading a report on the weather channel
8224526 our overwhelming conclusion is that a free trade agreement will not help the colombian people
8224527 calculates that overnight the emaciated and already under protected agricultural and industrial sectors in colombia will be capable of competing with their canadian counterparts
8224528 textiles footwear plastic products industrial metals chemicals and paper as well as machinery and automotive equipment
8224529 colombia continues to be the most dangerous country on earth for trade unions and civil society activists
8224530 from what we have learned 95 per cent of colombian workers do not have an enforceable collective agreement
8224531 we cannot accept a free trade agreement until this changes
8224532 it is easier to form a paramilitary gang than it is to form a trade union in this country
8224533 trade and investment and will help solidify ongoing efforts by the government of colombia to create a more prosperous equitable and secure democracy
8224534 in colombias current climate increased foreign investment will not lift all boats
8224535 colombia is offering canada an fta because it really wants the us congress to reconsider its opposition to such a deal
8224536 we are not clear where this legislation will go in canada
8224537 colombia imposes tariffs averaging 11 per cent on industrial goods 17 per cent on agricultural and 15 to 20 per cent on cotton yarns and paper products
8224538 the proposed agreement would benefit companies and workers in a wide range of industries including the automotive sector steel chemicals public infrastructure development oil drilling mining and advanced manufacturing such as mining machinery and equipment

8224590 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking

8224598 the dynamic on the ground at the convention itself is something we have little control over
8224599 that hillary clinton supporters are for example not united behind barack obama is something we cant rightfully take credit for thats all the thanks to the obama campaigns poor outreach there is however room for us to take advantage of some of these realities even if we didnt create them
8224600 in an election as close as even obamas people are starting realize this is going to be every little bit counts
8224601 so for us to be here and be part of the conversation is important and denver has proved more fertile ground for our message than democrats would like to admit

8224604 sterreich ist am ende einer sackgasse angelangt in die uns rot schwarz vor allem in den letzten zwei jahren man vriert hat
8224605 es sind b rger und menschenrechte geopfert worden ohne dass es irgendetwas f r unsere sicherheit gebracht hat
8224606 i have to say that while this is the worst year ever for chinas petrochemical sector the worst is still not yet past
8224607 we are thrilled that alaskan voters have spoken and they have made it clear that mining is part of our history in the state and part of our future
8224608 that such creatures could be weaponized and the possibility according to one scientist intimately familiar with the project that these cyborg insects might be armed with bio weapons
8224609 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
8224610 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
8224611 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
8224612 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
8224613 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
8224614 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
8224615 these kids may have quit at some point but the big thing is a lot of people have quit on them

8224618 i am honored to be here tonight a proud mother a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8224619 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8224620 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8224621 or were you in it for that young marine and others like him
8224622 america is still around after 232 years because we have risen to the challenge of every new time changing to be faithful to our values of equal opportunity for all and the common good
8224623 and i know what that can mean for every man woman and child in america
8224624 and so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter and a few sons and grandsons along the way
8224625 these women and men looked into their daughters eyes imagined a fairer and freer world and found the strength to fight to rally and picket to endure ridicule and harassment to brave violence and jail
8224626 and after so many decades 88 years ago on this very day the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our constitution
8224627 my mother was born before women could vote but in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8224628 this is the story of america of women and men who defy the odds and never give up
8224629 by following the example of a brave new yorker a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the underground railroad
8224630 and on that path to freedom harriett tubman had one piece of advice
8224631 if you see the torches in the woods keep going
8224632 even in the darkest of moments ordinary americans have found the faith to keep going
8224633 but remember before we can keep going we have to get going by electing barack obama president
8224634 we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare
8224635 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
8224636 it was such a strong speech and it took care of everybodys wish list
8224637 you kept hearing she has to do this she has to do that and do you know what she did it all she claimed her victory the victory of her candidacy and she threw it all to barack obama not grudgingly but gracefully
8224638 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8224639 i wish to make it plain that as i have consistently said i accept resolution 1 10 which views homosexual practice as incompatible with scriptures of the 1998 lambeth conference as stating the position of the worldwide anglican communion on issues of sexual ethics and this as providing the authoritative basis on which i as archbishop speak on such questions
8224640 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8224641 as a mark of our solidarity with our suffering brothers and sisters and as a protest against all acts of communal violence and atrocities on the christian community and other innocent people we request all our christian schools colleges and other educational institutions to be closed on friday august 29 2008 and we wish that everywhere peaceful marches rallies be conducted with black flags demonstration in a truly prayerful spirit
8224642 im looking forward to seeing andrew providing real competition for gavin henson and sonny parker
8224643 andrew has already proven his worth to the ospreys and last season we really saw him starting to make an impact
8224644 he got his reward for an excellent year when he was called up for the south africa tour and im sure that the experience will be of immense benefit for him this year as he looks to push on to the next level
8224645 its obvious to everybody at the ospreys that there are great things happening here weve got a quality squad and great coaches theres a real buzz about the place and were confident about our chances for the new season
8224646 last season was a fantastic one for me personally i really made my mark in the side had plenty of game time made the wales squad and now i want to build on that over the next four years
8224647 there are plenty of good centres at the ospreys so i cant take anything for granted but the situation is that the competition for places will benefit me the ospreys and will benefit wales
8224648 my first start was against green bay at home our home opener
8224649 i threw four picks maybe two three touchdowns and we almost came back the next week we played new orleans and i had a good game the headline on one of the papers the next day was joey to the world for he has come
8224650 it was immediate and unrealistic when those expectations were put on me being na ve and not knowing i embraced it and i took it as my job to be the one person to change a franchise when it didnt happen overnight i worked harder and pressed and did it to the point where it was ltimately my demise there
8224651 the quarterback is the premier position but matt won the starting quarterback job in training camp and otas we dont want to put any undue pressure on him hes one of 22 starters he is part of the process and this is a process that were going through were just going to continue to try and get better and improve every day
8224652 what they are doing with matt if youre going to play a kid right away this is the way to do it i also think matt is one of the more mature rookies ive seen come into the nfl
8224653 theres no magic formula to how to bring a rookie quarterback along
8224654 there are all sorts of scenarios the one key component is you need to have some success before you lose your confidence
8224655 i knew that people knew how much i had been paid and that it was going to be a source of resentment for some of the older guys in the locker room
8224656 i came in there trying to not make friends but came in there not trying to step on anybodys toes
8224657 for as much as everybody knows every dollar that youre getting paid whether you try to appease the subject or not theyre still going to expect you to play so you have to make plays i told him that youre going to step on some toes but take charge dont be afraid to take this as your team because no matter how much youre getting paid thats what people are going to expect you to do
8224658 its a good thing to see we understand what were doing and why were doing it
8224659 the thing about the game is you have to focus in on your goals and your responsibility in the game and not worry about all the other things going on outside
8224660 were trying to go out each and every day improving and gaining consistency
8224661 mike smith did a very nice job of letting the vets control some of the stuff thats going on
8224662 last year we had a dictatorship a coach telling everybody what to do mike understands the importance of having veterans and letting us show these guys what to do and how to do it the right way
8224663 last year i dont think then rookie defensive end jamaal anderson respected me as much as he does this year he got the big money he was that coaching staffs first pick hes back to earth now he knows im a nine year vet and lawyer and brooking carry weight weve been there we can show these guys
8224664 you bring the right guys in here that have a passion for the game and love to play and come out every day and want to be the best theyre going to fit in with guys like me lawyer and abraham
8224665 we just have to keep building on the little bit of success weve had
8224666 i will let you know that my party my party loathes me much more than your party the democratic party loathes me
8224667 what about your party whats your party david shuster david whats your party
8224668 oh i feel so comforted by the fact that youre independent i bet everyone at msnbc has independent on their voting cards
8224669 i think keith has gone too far i think chris has gone too far
8224670 knowshon had a spell there where he couldnt get any reps because of a sore shoulder
8224671 not to say he wont get revived one day as a punt returner but i doubt he does it the first game
8224672 i wouldnt count knowshon out of returning some punts before this year is over he is very capable and he would be excited about the opportunity
8224673 i wouldnt mind being back there catching a few i think that would be perfect i say id do anything to help the team out and if thats what the coaches want me to do then ill do it
8224674 i cant really see that right now unless the coaches see otherwise
8224675 we didnt have many guys last year but those guys stayed together from spring camp through the season
8224676 this year weve juggled them around more than we did all last year put together
8224677 a lot of us are two years older as far as being with coach stacy searels weve got another year under his training his technique this year we knew what coach searels wanted from us and we went into camp trying to give him that
8224678 heading into game one im pretty confident in the o line i think well do fine
8224679 last year it was the same way the guys were real young but as the season progressed they got better i can see that this year everyone is jelling together now and getting better each and every week each every day i think everythings going to be all right
8224680 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
8224681 there was quite a bit of retail activity today on low cap stocks and strategic buying on amw
8224682 also there was strong buying in jkh colombo dockyard and cic

8224685 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8224686 to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8224687 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8224688 banning these types of sites would be the equivalent of asking your boss do you think i really need to make sales calls or network cant i just hang out in my office and wait for the phone to ring
8224689 yes there are a few bad apples that may waste time on these tools but they will find ways to waste time even if they dont have social networking sites they will find something else to distract them

8224712 and what a girl wants more than anything in the world is for their boyfriend to say i love you
8224713 the l word is not thrown around by men as easily as it is by women but i didnt say it first hes very loving were very open and vocal

8224724 our corn supply is plentiful enough to meet everyones needs
8224725 in the uk alone in 2005 a similar investment in preventing deforestation and peatland destruction could have offset the equivalent of up to 37 of all uk co2 emissions in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies all this can be done within our current budget by ending wasteful and damaging biofuel subsidies

8224750 one cannot have god for his father who will not have the church for his mother
8224751 shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be condemned
8224752 why you must believe that he is the son of the living god
8224753 i guess that is the right faith to believe that jesus is the son of the living god we must believe all that christ has taught
8224754 the bible the whole of the bible and nothing but the bible
8224755 no not the bible and its private interpretation but the church of the living god
8224756 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you
8224757 sit down and write bibles and scatter them over the earth and let every man read his bible and judge for himself
8224758 go and write bibles and distribute them and let everyone judge for himself
8224759 my dear people save your soul for if you lose your soul all is lost
8224760 you must get a bible you can get one at such and such a shop
8224761 the lord save us and can we not go to heaven without that book
8224762 for my translation i must depend upon the opinion of the learned
8224763 you are going to hell as sure as you live
8224764 allow me to tell you that you are a pack of idolaters you worship a man for a god who is no god at all
8224765 if you have never felt religion you never had it and will go to hell for eternity
8224766 you are a strange set of people do you not understand the word of god there is no hell at all that idea is good enough to scare old women and children
8224767 baptize the men and let the women alone for the bible says unless a man be born again of water and the holy ghost he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven so
8224768 you are a presumptuous people do you not know that the bible tells you that you must work out your salvation in fear and trembling and you do not tremble at all by brethren if you want to go to heaven shake brother shake
8224769 let every man read the constitution and make a government unto himself let every man make his own explanation of the constitution
8224770 to the best of my opinion and judgment this is the meaning of the text
8224771 susanna is in the roman catholic canon it is daniel 13
8224772 apocrypha that is books which are not regarded as equal to the holy scriputres and yet are profitable and good to read
8224773 as to the apocriphe bookes i omit them because i am no papist as i said before
8224774 as the church reads the books of judith and tobit and maccabees but does not receive them among the canonical scriptures so also it reads wisdom and ecclesiasticus for the edification of the people not for the authoritative confirmation of doctrine
8224775 they considered it important and told their units not to leave evidence of the people they had assassinated
8224776 most of those who were disappeared are in graves or thrown in the river especially the cauca or magdalena rivers and it will never be possible even with enormous effort to find them
8224777 what do we do if people say bad things about us
8224778 you mean a blog can be used for seo purposes
8224779 i saw this as an opportunity to observe how police deal with underprivileged people
8224780 once i realized she was attempting to get me to give her my camera i became confused and told her i would not give it to her
8224781 i had not committed any crime and had been sitting peacefully just like many others around me
8224782 i found this to be absurd since there were no benches around and there were many other people sitting around the square
8224783 the ledge and the area around the ledge where i was sitting is styled in such a way that it appears to have been intended to be used as a seating area in addition to any other apparent purpose it may have
8224784 i havent paid my tuition for the last semester yet
8224785 if they do it in respect of the bylaw there is no problem
8224786 a successful public space develops conviviality use social interaction and obviously sitting around is basic
8224787 trying to eliminate that from a public space is completely opposite to its whole intention
8224788 i had just picked up chloe from nursery we were both hungry so i got us a sausage roll to share i had a bite and then bent down to give a bit to chloe who was on her bike
8224789 a tiny bit missed her mouth and fell on the floor and seconds later some pigeons flew down and grabbed it i crossed the road and was approached by two men at first i thought they were canvassers as they were dressed in tracksuit bottoms
8224790 but one came up to me said he was from the council and said i was going to be fined for dropping litter
8224791 i felt really small and humiliated i was treated like i was a criminal where is the common sense it was a small bite sized piece just big enough for her mouth
8224792 i went back to take a picture of the litter but it had been gobbled by pigeons there was no litter there at all
8224793 the issuing of the fixed penalty notice is the result of the mothers actions and not as a result of childs
8224794 its fairly common language these days to express sadness anger or hurt
8224795 its a degrading word to use and jesus is anything but that its like calling white black
8224796 when someone comes to the point of saying jesus is the devil or jesus is expletive the bible does say be very careful because youre on thin ice
8224797 one of the great problems with our country is that we talk about rights such as privacy and freedom of speech and the like but they are not enshrined or protected in any way as they are in america
8224798 while there are always limits on freedom of speech you cant incite violence or anything like that it seems to be now more than ever that our rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression should be protected
8224799 a bill of rights which enshrines that protection is long overdue in this country
8224800 a shirt might offend some and might be amusing to others
8224801 if a person was wearing the shirt in a church or a religious rally where it was specifically intended to offend or cause disruption then perhaps the prosecution might stand a chance re lick the jack boots reports and stories of outrageous control policy
8224802 if there are pervs or oglers theyd be hurried on by the lifeguards it is an open area it is not as if there are dirty old men in raincoats hiding behind phone boxes
8224803 i have bared my naked body to sun its freedom
8224804 as long as we dont wave our breasts about run around half naked or go topless into the pool i think it is okay
8224805 racist incidents among children in early years settings tend to be around name calling casual thoughtless comments and peer group relationships
8224806 react negatively to a culinary tradition other than their own by saying yuk
8224807 no racist incident should be ignored when there is a clear racist incident it is necessary to be specific in condemning the action
8224808 reveal negative attitudes the lack of censure may indicate to the child that there is nothing unacceptable about such attitudes
8224809 some people think that if a large number of racist incidents are reported this will reflect badly on the institution in fact the opposite is the case
8224810 to make passes on women and disturb families he said
8224811 to stop selling cats and dogs re lick the jack boots reports and stories of outrageous control policy
8224812 its something that has been heard of before and does crop up from time to time but it is absurd
8224813 anyone who dies there is technically entitled to a state funeral if they see you looking a bit sick they carry you out quickly
8224814 i indicated to the organisers of indy last year that i thought we could be doing better in relation to managing some of the more lewd behaviour
8224815 i dont think anyone wants to see the fun taken out of indy but i dont think most people want to see it cross the line into obscenity either
8224816 you can have a lot of fun without turning off international visitors and spectators
8224817 if the police can identify you they can make a charge
8224818 lasers have no place in childrens toys because of the significant safety risks ms gago said
8224819 they need to be concentrating on what they learn not how they are dressing
8224820 sadly i think this is probably linked with the current society where litigation is rife and i feel that schools are probably trying to avoid a child being hurt and an irresponsible mother then trying to sue them for it
8224821 the issue around the gymnastics is around the safety of the kids and it was not motivated by any concept of litigation but certainly by that safety and well being component of those kids when were talking heads and necks and potentially backs if there were an injury
8224822 id be interested to hear from this school what prompted them to take this action because school communities by and large try to meet the standards that parents have in that community

8224830 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you
8224831 sit down and write bibles and scatter them over the earth and let every man read his bible and judge for himself
8224832 go and write bibles and distribute them and let everyone judge for himself
8224833 my dear people save your soul for if you lose your soul all is lost
8224834 you must get a bible you can get one at such and such a shop
8224835 the lord save us and can we not go to heaven without that book
8224836 for my translation i must depend upon the opinion of the learned
8224837 you are going to hell as sure as you live
8224838 allow me to tell you that you are a pack of idolaters you worship a man for a god who is no god at all
8224839 if you have never felt religion you never had it and will go to hell for eternity
8224840 you are a strange set of people do you not understand the word of god there is no hell at all that idea is good enough to scare old women and children
8224841 baptize the men and let the women alone for the bible says unless a man be born again of water and the holy ghost he cannot enter the kingdom of heaven so
8224842 you are a presumptuous people do you not know that the bible tells you that you must work out your salvation in fear and trembling and you do not tremble at all by brethren if you want to go to heaven shake brother shake
8224843 let every man read the constitution and make a government unto himself let every man make his own explanation of the constitution
8224844 to the best of my opinion and judgment this is the meaning of the text
8224845 susanna is in the roman catholic canon it is daniel 13
8224846 apocrypha that is books which are not regarded as equal to the holy scriputres and yet are profitable and good to read
8224847 as to the apocriphe bookes i omit them because i am no papist as i said before
8224848 as the church reads the books of judith and tobit and maccabees but does not receive them among the canonical scriptures so also it reads wisdom and ecclesiasticus for the edification of the people not for the authoritative confirmation of doctrine
8224849 the local bishop was not happy but they did not understand me either it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
8224850 i think its safe to say right now that newspapers and their business model is falling apart
8224851 i dont have an attachment to newspapers per se but i do have an attachment to journalism
8224852 the big picture here is that we need to do a lot of innovation and experimentation right now
8224853 trying to give the public a freelance budget to hire a freelance reporter
8224854 there will be barriers against people with an axe to grind and im going to limit how much one person can donate
8224855 but if you have an entire neighborhood of people who are willing to throw 5 or 10 to fund an investigation to me that means that a journalist should respond thats not having an axe to grind
8224856 it is the public that commissions the journalists but the journalists arent beholden to any of them and every article and every investigation is going to have an editor whose job it is to check the integrity of the money that is raised
8224857 we thought that this was a definite way to use the inherent abilities of the web to further journalism
8224858 we are all aware that the expensive people being laid off at newspapers are experienced cover local news and do investigative reports
8224859 wake up america the insurance companies took over health care

8224862 der see ist bei der besitzerin fr waechter in sehr guten h nden das kann aber f r die zukunft unter anderen privatbesitzern nicht gew hrleistet werden

8224865 der vp burgenland d rfte es entgangen sein dass es gerade norbert darabos war der sich f r den assistenzeinsatz im grenzraum eingesetzt und diesen garantiert hat
8224866 darabos hat platters vorhaben revidiert und per ministerratsbeschluss november 2007 den assistenzeinsatz im grenzraum f r 2008 mit bis zu 1 500 mann sichergestellt
8224867 sie forderte sogar nur 800 von 1 500 bestehenden mann und m chte dar ber hinaus die polizei weiter abbauen
8224868 es war darabos der die von strommers kollegen verschleppte bundesheerreform z gig vorantrieb aus der das burgenland als gewinner hervor ging
8224869 der verteidigungsminister hat vor wenigen monaten die pl ne zum ausbau der kaserne g ssing mit einem investitionsvolumen von 33 millionen euro pr sentiert
8224870 nach abschluss der reform wird es mehr arbeitspl tze beim bundesheer geben als es zu zeiten eines vp verteidigungsministers jemals gab
8224871 die vp sollte lieber sicherstellen dass ihre ministerin fekter endlich eine personalstandsgarantie f r die polizei gibt wie sie landeshauptmann niessl seit monaten fordert
8224872 wenn strommer meint es g be nicht genug soldaten im assistenzeinsatz m ge er fekter auffordern mehr anzufordern darabos hat 1 500 garantiert und diese stehen bereit stellt sich die frage warum die vp nicht anfordern will
8224873 weder sp noch vp haben bisher auf unsere gespr chsangebote f r ein nachhaltiges entlastungspaket reagiert und nach der methode friss vogel oder stirb werden wir uns sicher nicht vor den wahlkampfkarren der beiden koalitionsparteien spannen lassen
8224874 von der sp mitgetragenen staatlich legitimierten ausbeutung der b rger
8224875 aber daf r hat der falsche f nfziger faymann die halbierung der eingangssteuer f r stiftungen und der erh hung der mineral lsteuer vorangetrieben
8224876 sp und vp ist vor der wahl wieder eingefallen was sie bisher vers umt haben mit den steuermehreinnahmen von 9 6 mrd euro h tten sie schon l ngst eine ordentliche steuerreform finanzieren k nnen
8224877 das hei t nichts anderes als dass einkommen und kaufkraft der sterreicher im keller sind
8224878 und nicht l cherliche drei milliarden entlastung sondern sechs milliarden damit die b rger wieder ein auskommen mit ihrem einkommen finden
8224879 bis zur nationalratssitzung flie t noch viel wasser die donau hinunter ich sage ihnen aber schon jetzt dass bis dahin nur die fp auf ihren forderungen beharren wird das hei t f r die b rger wer genug von der teuerung und der steuerbelastung hat muss am 28 september seine stimme der fp geben nur dann wird er wieder ein auskommen mit seinem einkommen finden ohne sich bei den beh rden f r staatliche almosen anstellen zu m ssen

8224882 yesterday tuesday we spoke with the israelis during defence minister ehud baraks visit to egypt and asked them to stop thinking about threatening this friendly arab country
8224883 the moment the lebanese government confers legitimacy on hezbollah it must understand that the entire lebanese state will be a target in the same way that all of israel is a target for hezbollah

8224914 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

8224919 tahun sebelumnya ifc sudah berinvestasi di danamon dan bii total investasi keduanya mencapai lebih dari us 100 juta untuk bantuan kredit porsi danamon lebih besar dari bii
8224920 pada saat inflasi tinggi dan rising interest rate yang mulai naik dan bisa memberikan pressure tiba tiba kepada sistem jadi saya setuju dengan bi bahwa kredit growth yang sangat cepat di makroekonomi seperti ini hrs diamati secara hati hati oleh bi dan bank bank
8224921 jadi yang harus diamati tergantung dari kemana dia akan pergi dan bagaimana penyalurannya

8224926 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8224927 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8224928 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8224929 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8224930 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8224931 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8224932 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8224933 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8224934 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8224935 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8224936 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8224937 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8224938 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8224939 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8224940 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8224941 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8224942 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8224943 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8224944 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8224945 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8224946 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8224947 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8224948 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8224949 hes done amazingly well hes a talented footballer a talented athlete hes ahead of me when i was at his stage
8224950 id love to get back playing with the lads again and hopefully i can do that in the off season
8224951 did the mayo fans not know that their team was playing today
8224952 the team and management deserve more than they got on sunday it was sad to see just a few hundred mayo fans in croke park the players have given so much this year its now past time for us to give them something back as a sportsman im asking the football followers of mayo to travel to ennis on saturday to cheer on ray and the lads
8224953 in fairness the supporters that were here gave us a great lift but it would be nice if we did have a bit more support the next day the lads deserve it
8224954 there are a lot of emotions floating around right now but we have to get ready for the replay and put all our energies into that we competed well for the full hour but we just didnt execute some things well enough and well have to improve in a number of different aspects the next day
8224955 a lot of our lads played well but theyll have to do so again the next day well be looking forward to playing kerry again theyre one of the strongholds of the gaa and lads learn a lot from playing them
8224956 kerry will give us a lot of problems again their full forward line is exceptional and the guthire lad at midfield was very good in the last 15 minutes but our own james cafferty was very good there as well i think that well take a lot from todays match build on the performance and move to another level well have to if were going to compete
8224957 yeah we kicked a few wides we had chances to kill the game off and if they appear the next day we have to grab them
8224958 kerry missed chances too and we cant be too harsh on the young lads were all experts in the stands but these young lads are learning their trade kerry will bring some of those lads directly onto the senior panel and they made the same mistakes as our lads its a learning curve for everyone
8224959 the more hard games lads get at this level the more they develop and tough matches like these will stand to them later every time a lad gets to wear the mayo jersey its a privilege and our lads wore their colours with distinction today
8224960 our full forward line scored 3 10 from play against offaly today they got a point but a lot of that goes down to good mayo play were very disappointed with our performance but we didnt become a bad team overnight and well be looking forward to the replay next weekend
8224961 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8224962 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8224963 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8224964 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8224965 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8224966 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8224967 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8224968 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8224969 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8224970 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8224971 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8224972 who are open to doing something on the production side
8224973 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8224974 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8224975 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8224976 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8224977 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8224978 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8224979 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8224980 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8224981 het is een hele moeilijke markt we zijn fors gezakt nu is het een beetje afwachten tot er weer richting wordt gekozen

8224986 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8224987 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8224988 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8224989 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8224990 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8224991 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8224992 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8224993 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8224994 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8224995 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8224996 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8224997 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8224998 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8225030 sozialdemokratischen bildungspolitik mehr chancen und besserer unterricht f r unsere kinder stellung
8225031 in der bildungspolitik hat ministerin schmied in den letzten 18 monaten viel zur verbesserung der chancen erreicht
8225032 wir d rfen keine zeit verlieren je fr her wir uns zusammensetzen desto besser ist es
8225033 breiten gemeinsamen allianz der schulreformer gelungen ist wichtige projekte umzusetzen
8225034 beste schule f r alle kinder unabh ngig von einkommen und herkunft der eltern
8225035 wer in die bildung investiert investiert in die zukunft des landes
8225036 sich die qualit t der schule um zwei pl tze verbessert
8225037 lehrerinnen im interesse aller fr hzeitig herausfinden k nnen ob ihnen der beruf liegt
8225038 h tten wir mehr klassenr ume k nnten wir auch noch mehr sch ler aufnehmen
8225039 hier hat sich viel getan wir geben gro e erm igungen und haben auch eltern aus anderen schichten die ganz einfach investieren um ihren kindern das einzig sichere auf ihren lebensweg mitzugeben n mlich eine fundierte bildung
8225040 was die orden in westeuropa und nordamerika an schulgeld bekommen investieren sie vielfach in ganz anderen erdteilen etwa in st dtischen elendsgebieten in lateinamerika oder afrika wo die kinder nicht nur zur schule gehen sondern auch aufgep ppelt werden von daher ist es gut angelegtes geld und hat auch eine weltweite soziale dimension
8225041 wir haben nie von au en zugeschaut wenn es entwicklungen gegeben hat
8225042 unser vorteil ist wenn ein projekt an einer katholischen schule gemacht wird dann wei man wir sind unverd chtige zeugen ob es stimmt oder nicht l sst es sich empirisch nachweisen dass es hier ein mehr an qualit t und ein mehr an gerechtigkeit gibt oder l sst es nicht nachweisen
8225043 hier zu ermutigen und zu professionalisieren ist das gebot der stunde dem stellen wir uns und freuen uns auch dass sehr viele lehrerinnen und lehrer das aufgreifen
8225044 einerseits ist es in vielen l ndern selbstverst ndlich und es schadet den kindern durchaus nicht wenn man sie langsam in den prozess des lernens einf hrt weil kinder sehr neugierig sind und an sich sehr gerne lernen
8225045 dann kann man nur sagen schont unsere kinder lasst sie kind sein
8225046 alles wo das elternhaus ausl sst geht irgendwie an die schule weiter das hat eine nat rliche grenze
8225047 wertevermittlung und soziales lernen kann die schule nur bruchst ckhaft nachholen aber nicht wirklich ersetzen
8225048 es ist an der zeit n gel mit k pfen zu machen die gr nen haben bereits einen entsprechenden antrag f r die gesetzliche festschreibung einer mindestens 40 igen frauenquote in aufsichtsr ten und vorst nden staatlicher oder staatsnaher betriebe ausgearbeitet bei der n chsten nationalratssitzung h tte die sp die m glichkeit zu zeigen dass es ihr mit ihren frauenpolitischen forderungen wirklich ernst ist in dem sie das 5 punkte programm von werner faymann um einen sechsten punkt erg nzt
8225049 die verbesserten chancen von frauen beim aufstieg in f hrungspositionen kommen auch den einzelnen unternehmen und der wirtschaft zu gute zahlreiche studien belegen dass ein h herer frauenanteil im management mit einen besseren unternehmenserfolg bringt es ist h chst an der zeit f r die sp nicht immer nur wahlkampfversprechen abzugeben sondern diese auch f r die frauen umzusetzen

8225056 the u k is the first place we were warned about under dress shots weve been scared ever since
8225057 it bothers me because i didnt get into the industry for that but you just have to plan stuff out
8225058 its not the attention that i personally want to get but sometimes you just have to realize that its a part of what you do and embrace it and make sure youre poised to represent yourself the best way you can

8225069 nato asks all the member states every year what efforts they can make in afghanistan but we were not specifically asked to send more troops

8225079 a number of ingredients can provide uva protection including avobenzone and the recently approved mexoryl to say there is no protection against uva is misleading the consumer
8225080 bringing a new active ingredient to market is a very intensive process in europe and the united states
8225081 uva penetrates much deeper and doesnt produce the same visible sunburn effects
8225082 if you are going to measure how well you are being protected you have to decide on a marker or indicator of damage the methods are still evolving and this is one of the reasons why the fda has deferred

8225100 newcastle united can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner
8225101 the club is very disappointed that james sees his footballing future as being away from st james park
8225102 he is a valued member of the squad and it is only a year ago that he signed an improved long term contract
8225103 we have yet to receive an offer for james that has matched our valuation of the player
8225104 however should such an offer be received then the club would be reluctantly forced to consider it given james apparent desire to leave

8225114 its a first step but its not even the most important one in my mind
8225115 when a company buys technology there has to be an implementation plan
8225116 governments should do exactly the same on a larger scale
8225117 is it possible to develop any work in the sense of integrating them to the digital inclusion movement
8225118 i dont reach the next 1 billion or 2 billion people without great shared access

8225123 its 100 per cent recyclable credentials and its use of some of the earths most abundant raw materials sand soda ash and limestone makes glass a very good story when it comes to environmental protection and contribution to combating climate change
8225124 the overall economic situation means that the general reluctance to consume is an unfortunate fact to which our customers and their customers have to adapt
8225125 however the slight trend recovery in the second quarter underlines the optimism of the european aluminium foil industry for the rest of the year 2008

8225158 jamie and i have done the research and figured that the only way to end the debate about the myth of the apollo moon landing is to go there

8225160 god saw all that he had made and it was very good
8225161 and the lord god commanded the man you are free to eat from any tree in the garden but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for when you eat of it you will surely die
8225162 i heard you in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked so i hid
8225163 until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return
8225164 therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned

8225202 utah is one of the states that is being hit most directly with climate change energy development water conflicts and other environmental and social justice issues and is far behind most other states in addressing these issues i think the gput and the national green party have a chance to be leaders in going beyond mere talk and actually reversing the tide of the social and environmental crises in the west

8225239 kelly had already called in sick to work for radio one on sunday because she was doubled over with bad stomach pains
8225240 when she got home she reached up to get a glass of water from the cupboard to have a drink when the entire thing fell off the wall and smashed into her face

8225252 the north koreans have mastered the nuclear fuel cycle they understand the technical aspects of it
8225253 they have the human resources which is the most important
8225254 the north koreans thinking may be we can rebuild it we can make it better and we have enough nuclear weapons to deter anyone for the one to three years it might take to get this back up and running
8225255 north korea is biding its time thinking there is no rush for denuclearisation
8225256 what this has meant is the u s agreeing to the north korean demands and kicking the can down the road on any contentious issues
8225257 just when we thought the six party talks where dead they keep coming back to life
8225258 while i firmly condemn every attack on human life whose sacredness required respect by all i express my spiritual closeness and solidarity to the brothers and sisters in the faith who are so sorely tried
8225259 it is not a fight it does not call for violence and we would not allow a single ghanaian blood to be spilled over this simple but important democratic expression of choice
8225260 we are not promising kenya situation in ghana but if the npp takes advantage of its incumbency to rig the december general elections in its favour then the ndc has no option than to do everything within its power and means to take the governance of this country by hook or crook
8225261 the ndc just dont get it they know they have no message no credible track record they dont have a strong candidate and their structures on the ground are weak

8225265 it is clear based on yesterdays ruling that the lawsuit by taros independent directors was part of a calculated effort by barry levitt to avoid living up to his obligations under the option agreement it is time for dr levitt and his family to live up to the contract and do what is required of them under the option agreement
8225266 these shareholders benefited from suns investment which basically saved taro from collapse
8225267 the government is committed to mobilising the needed resources to ensure the smooth implementation of the 2010 population and housing census

8225270 we have some land reserve for the resettlement but we will raise rs1 000 crore through debt to buy more land in the vicinity of the airport to relocate the remaining people we will buy land which is within a kilometre from the airport

8225272 the objective of expanding our power business is to facilitate our core business which is real estate we are also looking at more acquisitions in the power sector
8225273 historically only dlf had cement and power businesses which it later exited now in a tight real estate market many developers are attempting at new sectors with good potential by hiring expertise and using their network
8225274 high skilled emigration may have a particularly severe impact on the health sector and the emigration of doctors and nurses may reduce the likelihood of some countries meeting the millennium development goals for reducing child mortality improving maternal health and combating hiv aids and tuberculosis
8225275 russland ver ndert eigenm chtig und mit gewalt die grenzen europas wenn europa sich das einmal gefallen l sst wird russland es in zukunft wieder versuchen

8225305 es gibt juristisch keinen hinderungsgrund in diesen dienstleistungsbereich zu vermitteln
8225306 warum soll dann von einer erwachsene frau nicht verlangt werden ihr einkommen durch kommerzielles v geln zu erzielen
8225307 strafrechtlich gibt es auch keine barrieren h chstens kulturelle gesellschaftliche und moralische hemmungen
8225308 da hat es der gesetzgeber vers umt normen zu schaffen
8225309 bordelle und prostituierte zahlen arbeitslosen kranken und sozialversicherung dann haben sie auch ein recht auf vermittlung durch das arbeitsamt
8225310 eine frau kann in diesem gewerbe nur arbeiten wenn sie dazu bereit ist
8225311 es w re auch nutzlos mich als krankenschwester zu vermitteln
8225312 es wird grenzf lle geben so die kellnerin die im kurzen r ckchen hinterm bordelltresen stehen soll oder die t nzerin die in ein tabledance lokal vermittelt wird
8225313 es ist sicherlich m glich eine solche arbeit abzulehnen aber das k nnte probleme geben

8225328 la russie risque de se retrouver dans une position disolement tr s dangereuse si aucun autre etat ne soutient lind pendance de labkhazie et de loss tie
8225329 la russie a r ussi ces derni res ann es nouer des contacts par exemple avec le monde arabe il nest pas exclu que la turquie liran la syrie ou la jordanie soutiennent la russie en loccurrence mais ce nest pas certain
8225330 de nombreuses r gions de russie disposent pr sent dun nouvel argument en faveur de leur ind pendance et il faut tre clair l dessus ainsi la stabilisation du caucase pourrait pr sent prendre une toute autre tournure
8225331 pour le caucase du nord la d cision de moscou est une preuve de d termination et de force comme il en a souvent manqu ces derni res ann es mais cette satisfaction risque d tre suivie dune r action bien diff rente

8225340 between 90 days and six months we start seeing a breakdown of the aspartame and end up with products that give an extremely bitter flavour and we dont even know the safety of that yet they should absolutely bear a label
8225341 consumers need to care about where their food comes from and how its being handled before its sold to them
8225342 our troops carried out an operations this morning and we have reports that 30 militants including some uzbeks were killed
8225343 there is still a lot of uncertainty on the political front people just want to get out of the market
8225344 this is a victory for the people and its great to be back
8225345 i told my teenage daughter not to look up at the banners
8225346 it was so terrible so shameful the way they attack anwar praise god he has won

8225353 the decision of where to send aid was made at the highest level of the pentagon and the only decision was to send it to batumi
8225354 we categorically deny that the sudan liberation movement has carried out the hijacking
8225355 we condemn any act that causes harm to any sudanese civilian
8225356 say anything now but we are considering everything so that the passengers the 100 passengers are protected
8225357 he says he doesnt know these people and that he absolutely refuses to use such methods
8225358 destabilize security and is part of the events taking part in the darfur provinces
8225359 save your lives and reach relief camps and other safe places there is very little time to escape the death and destruction
8225360 they considered it important and told their units not to leave evidence of the people they had assassinated
8225361 most of those who were disappeared are in graves or thrown in the river especially the cauca or magdalena rivers and it will never be possible even with enormous effort to find them
8225362 guns dont kill people rappers do i saw it in a documentary on bbc2
8225363 i would say some people thought we were going to die the woman sitting in the seat in front of us was whimpering
8225364 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft there was absolutely no communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible
8225365 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
8225366 i was scared i think everyone was scared ive got three kids and my wife on the flight and i just sat there helplessly thinking it might be the end
8225367 i would say the crew didnt know what to do they didnt inform us for about 20 minutes which i think was wrong a little information would have calmed everyone down
8225368 my wifes oxygen bag inflated and so did my sons mine stayed flat all around me people kept tugging and saying its not working properly
8225369 the first thing we do in these situations is take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
8225370 they usually inflate when passengers exhale its a trickle of pure oxygen you dont feel a rush of gas all its doing is enriching the low pressure air
8225371 the pilot is having to navigate having to communicate with air traffic control and having to avoid hitting other aeroplanes his priority is to keep the aeroplane safe
8225372 they satisfy every single safety level but it is the minimum
8225373 pull down on the mask to start the flow of oxygen
8225374 my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son
8225375 the pilot act will first to get the plane to a safe height and explain later
8225376 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8225377 it is prudent for the governor general to remain in canada
8225378 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8225379 we issued shoot on sight orders in the wake of large scale violence in curfew bound areas of kandhamal
8225380 the pieces of evidence presented against the accused in this case does not satisfy the test of moral certainty and may not be deemed sufficient to support a conviction his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt
8225381 existing records and documents did not jibe in a certain point or there are not ducments to support it
8225382 such being the case from what sources of fund would the ex city treasurer have obtained the unliquidated cash advances of ex city mayor navarro there is therefore sufficent basis to conclude that there is in fact a doubtful validity on the alleged accounts of the accused
8225383 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius
8225384 the president susilo said that this mission only fail if all of us quit
8225385 as our experience in handling aceh rebellion there was a setback the key to handling this business is never give up
8225386 president susilo said that indonesia wanted gambari to keep plying his constructive role under the support of the focus group
8225387 the president hopes for a resumption of dialogue between the myanmar government and aung san suu kyi
8225388 the militants have entered my house my four children and wife are inside a boy from the neighbourhood may also be inside
8225389 a high alert has been sounded in jammu due to the infiltration by three terrorists from across the international border
8225390 this is a serious situation the intruders sneaked into the indian side under the cover of fire which was most probably provided by the pakistani rangers
8225391 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
8225392 stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy
8225393 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe is aimed at the russian federation
8225394 russia is a great nation look how we have been treating it we need firmness not threats we must not threaten them because it will not work because everyone knows we are not going to war
8225395 to include more pro american oriented countries into the alliance
8225396 we have to be prepared to talk we cannot afford to isolate russia
8225397 imagine if we were forced to intervene militarily to defend georgia as a nato country on behalf of an obvious gambler which is clearly the way one should characterize georgian president mikheil saakashvili
8225398 the starting point of the military confrontation was georgias march into south ossetia we should not confuse things
8225399 i dont know how they are going to isolate us
8225400 is sending an emphatic message with global consequences the curtain has fallen on the era when nato steadily expanded into eastern europe and onwards to embrace the former republics of the soviet union and russia was able to respond with nothing more than bluster the balance of power in europe has fundamentally changed

8225410 the beginning of a heroin shortage in europe by the end of 2001
8225411 karzai has been a central intelligence agency covert operator since the 1980s he collaborated with the cia in funneling u s aid to the taliban as of 1994 when the americans had secretly and through the pakistanis specifically the isi supported the talibans assumption of power
8225412 now would be a good time however for families to review their evacuation plans
8225413 we cannot accept these violations of international law of accords for security and cooperation in europe of united nations resolutions and the taking of a territory by the army of a neighboring country
8225414 i hope that didnt happen overnight but there has already been evidence that the armies are pushing away the ossetians who favored georgia and in a certain way yes an ethnic cleansing is taking place
8225415 this is going to get worse and its an extremely dangerous situation

8225421 es ist sch n dass faymann meine ideen kopiert aber ich fordere auch eine halbierung der mehrwertsteuer auf mieten und medikamente denn das w rde pensionisten wirklich helfen faymanns vorschl ge gehen einfach nicht weit genug
8225422 mich am siert diese faymann aktion eigentlich sollte er ja eine liste mit strache gr nden beide haben keine eigenen ideen sondern kopieren dauernd nur meine vorschl ge
8225423 die aktuelle vc studie zur verkehrsentwicklung in den ballungsr umen best tigt eindrucksvoll die gr ne verkehrspolitik
8225424 ich hoffe dass sich stadtrat schicker die zeit nimmt diese studie wirklich zu lesen und daraus die richtigen schl sse f r die wiener verkehrspolitik zieht
8225425 deshalb ist eine rasche offensive im ffentlichen verkehr auch in wien das gebot der stunde
8225426 angesichts der nicht berraschenden entwicklung bei den benzinpreisen ist ein rascher ausbau des ffentlichen verkehrs neben den positiven auswirkungen auf das klima auch eine wichtige sozialpolitische ma nahme dazu geh rt auch eine gratis ben tzung der ffentlichen verkehrsmittel f r alle sch lerinnen und lehrlinge f r studentinnen soll die studienfreifahrt von wohnort zur uni wieder eingef hrt werden
8225427 qualit t und verl sslichkeit vieler schnellbahnen ins wiener umland sind h ufig eine einzige zumutung f r die pendlerinnen die wiener stadtregierung ist hier seit jahren s umig
8225428 zuallererst muss also der ffentliche verkehr so attraktiv gemacht werden dass er eine wirkliche alternative zum auto darstellt erst dann kann man ber eine weitere ausweitung der parkraumbewirtschaftung und falls erforderlich ber die einf hrung einer sozial gestaffelten city maut nachdenken
8225429 um die hohe lebensqualit t in wien zu erhalten ist eine radikale wende in der wiener verkehrspolitik notwendig weg von der utopie der autogerechten stadt hin zum tats chlichen vorrang f r den ffentlichen verkehr
8225430 die rund 2 000 neuen mitglieder monatlich beweisen gerade in anbetracht der aktuellen teuerungswelle den hohen bedarf nach leistbaren grundnahrungsmitteln in der bev lkerung
8225431 der marketinggag von werner faymann wird von fast allen expertinnen in der luft zerrissen selten war ein befund so eindeutig der sp vorschlag die mehrwertsteuer auf lebensmittel zu senken ist nicht mehr als eine durchsichtige mogelpackung mit der die unt tigkeit der gro en koalition im kampf gegen die teuerung kaschiert werden soll
8225432 faymann und vp obmann molterer haben genug zeit gehabt wirksame ma nahmen gegen explodierende energiepreise oder steigenden bildungskosten zu ergreifen jetzt angesichts sinkender umfragendaten eine 180 grad kehrtwendung hinzulegen ist unglaubw rdig der sp mwst plan ist wirtschaftspolitischer unfug und sozial nicht treffsicher
8225433 dar ber hinaus muss der energieumstieg weg von teurem l und gas hin zu erneuerbaren energietr gern massiv gef rdert gratiskinderg rten ab dem 1 lebensjahr eingef hrt und investitionen in den ffentlichen verkehr beschleunigt werden
8225434 sp chef faymann hat gestern in der tv konfrontation mit bundessprecher alexander van der bellen heftige kritik an den kinderbetreuungszahlen in ober sterreich ge bt damit hat er sich ein pr chtiges eigentor geschossen denn f r kinderbetreuung in obers sterreich ist faymanns sp freund ackerl zust ndig

8225438 the elle new talent award changed my life i went from being a small time designer who worked from home with a small client base to being who i am today
8225439 it is a great platform for young designers who are ready for the world and for the industry which is not an easy industry to delve into this year we were looking for something fresh we want a new brand from south africa and not the traditional stuff we have we dont want another stone cherrie or something south africa has talent and we can set international standards and as a panel we feel that anisa ami mpungwe has what it takes
8225440 why dont we make a better operating system to compete with dell
8225441 great idea lets design an operating system thats better than windows
8225442 hey wait a minute this isnt fair hp is competing with us how dare they they cant make their own operating system they have to license it
8225443 hey wait a second judge we spent billions of dollars making this operating system and spend millions more maintaining it dell didnt lift a finger now youre telling me we have to license them our new software
8225444 screw it if we have to license every os we write whats the use of writing it when were just going to have to give it away for far less than we would make on hardware were just doing cheap r amp d for dell so that they can turn around and beat us in the market again why should hp do that if we can continue to license windows for twenty dollars a copy
8225445 if apple has to allow hardware manufacturers to sell computers with mac os which would compete with their business model you would have to force chervolet to sell their corvette bodies to ford
8225446 hey go write and design your own operating system something better than os x
8225447 hey just let apple spend billions developing an operating sytem and when its good and ready sue them in court and gets the rights to sell it and then when thats done put it on second rate third party hardware and when it runs like crap just blame it on apple so that everyone thinks os x is crap then you can go back to selling people versions of windows

8225630 blessed is he who has regard for the weak the lord delivers him in times of trouble
8225631 teach your children to choose the right path and when they are older they will remain upon it
8225632 and manufacture something that they hold as a god in their life
8225633 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
8225634 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
8225635 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased
8225636 guarantee s a us edge to carry out nuclear war without risking a counter strike
8225637 were at war against determined enemies and we must not rest until that war is won
8225638 stands for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia

8225640 no one with good intentions towards us and the west should
8225641 moscows willingness to crush georgia with overwhelming force and claims the kremlin has 10 times as many tactical short range warheads as the us
8225642 pugnacious russia determined to acquire economic and military power and not afraid to use threats and force to get its way with nuclear weapons central to the russian geopolitical calculus
8225643 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
8225644 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
8225645 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
8225646 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
8225647 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
8225648 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
8225649 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
8225650 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
8225651 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
8225652 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
8225653 russian tanks rolling through georgia with images of chechnya in 1994 and 99 vilnius 91 afghanistan 79 prague 68 hungary 56 and before that poland the baltics and other eastern european states
8225654 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
8225655 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
8225656 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
8225657 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
8225658 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
8225659 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
8225660 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
8225661 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia

8225664 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
8225665 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
8225666 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
8225667 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
8225668 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
8225669 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
8225670 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
8225671 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
8225672 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
8225673 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
8225674 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
8225675 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
8225676 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
8225677 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

8225840 do we have a quarterback it seems like chris mortensen is making the decision on our quarterback for our football team but nothing has changed
8225841 i hope to be ready and i certainly dont want to create this dramatic announcement i think i will do some parts of practice today and tomorrow and i may even dress for thursdays game though i wont play well do a short practice monday and then hopefully ill be full go wednesday
8225842 im not saying were marvin harrison and reggie wayne of the colts or anything
8225843 but i think calvin and i can be pretty good on the outside if we get a chance if this thing works the way we hope i think were looking at a breakout season to me well be the third best duo in the league
8225844 it doesnt bother me one way or the other im still going to do the same thing its part of the business
8225845 i dont think he needs to carry it 30 times for us
8225846 i dont think he needs to carry it 25 i think 20 would be great you have to be smart with a guy you get him 20 carries a game thats being smart and productive you can get him the ball some other ways through the passing game
8225847 i dont want the guy to be a one or two year flash and be done with him history supports that
8225848 we have a new leader man a new leader on the ship
8225849 when he stands up in the room and you hear him talk you know that he knows what hes talking about everything is going to change this year
8225850 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is
8225851 in theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is
8225852 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
8225853 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
8225854 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8225855 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8225856 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8225857 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8225858 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity

8225878 ich wei es wird schwer aber ich habe immer noch hoffnung
8225879 2008 haben wir sogar zwei spanische rennen das ist schon ein schreckliches gef hl
8225880 ich kann mich nur darauf konzentrieren dass ich beim n chsten test wieder im auto sitzen werde das ist das einzige was mich gerade motiviert
8225881 um es ganz klar zu sagen ich will wieder rennen fahren
8225882 ich komme doch nicht an die strecke nur um f r das fernsehen zu kommentieren oder mir anzusehen was mein team alles macht ich wei es wird schwer aber ich habe immer noch die kleine hoffung dass ich wieder rennen fahren kann
8225883 es scheint als ob es in diesem jahr auf stadtkursen einfach nicht f r mich zu laufen scheint
8225884 in vier rennen habe ich nur einen punkt geholt und das war in melbourne in monaco war der unfall mit sutil in montr al ist mir lewis hamilton ins heck gefahren und in valencia gab es wieder einen ausfall
8225885 auch weil es immer toll ist auf einem neuen kurs zu fahren
8225886 aber am samstag war es k hler und ich hatte probleme in der qualifikation wir h tten wesentlich aggressiver agieren m ssen
8225887 in ein paar rennen in ungarn und deutschland habe ich fehler gemacht und musste von platz sechs starten in valencia bin ich nur ganz knapp an startplatz drei vorbeigefahren
8225888 wenn du auf einer solchen strecke im verkehr steckst kannst du nicht viel machen
8225889 ich konnte die autos vor mir nicht berholen w hrend heikki kovalainen viel mehr grip hatte als ich und vorbeiziehen konnte von da ab sind die spitzenreiter mit einer sekunde pro runde davongezogen und ich habe um den vierten platz gek mpft wenn du auf einer solchen strecke im verkehr steckst kannst du nicht viel machen du kannst nur auf den boxenstopp warten
8225890 aber ich habe dann einen fehler gemacht und bin zu fr h losgefahren leider wurde unser mann pietro tempini vom auto getroffen und verletzt er hat sich einen haarriss im rechten fu zugezogen aber ist weitgehend okay es ist nichts ernstes und ich hoffe dass er bald wieder bei uns ist
8225891 falls irgendjemand an meiner motivation zweifelt ich will gewinnen mehr als je zuvor
8225892 damit h tte ich zumindest noch drei punkte geholt aber dann ist der motor hochgegangen ohne vorwarnung
8225893 ich bin aus der letzten kurve gekommen und habe gesp rt dass etwas nicht stimmt und dann kam rauch aus dem heck des autos nach dem was felipe in ungarn passiert ist wussten wir dass es ein solches problem geben k nnte aber trotzdem ist das was in valencia passiert ist wirklich schade
8225894 was passiert ist ist passiert und wir m ssen nun nach vorn schauen am freitag teste ich in monza n chste woche geht es nach spa diese strecke liebe ich ich w rde dort gern das ganze jahr fahren das ist die beste aller rennstrecke und ich hoffe dass das auto so l uft wie ich will ich gebe alles um wieder zu gewinnen falls irgendjemand an meiner motivation zweifelt ich will gewinnen mehr als je zuvor

8225908 hey roddy hows it going just wanted to let ya know that yesterday we we had our 2nd annual roughriders ld party at wascana rehab center i was wondering if you could make mention on your blog about the incredible participation once again by our players on hand yesterday was kitwana jones maurice lloyd scott gordon marcus adams sean lucas lance frazier john chick and anton mackenzie all of whom spent upwards of 2 hours on their day off signing autographs taking photos and sharing stories with the fine folks at wrc it was a great success and once again the riders outdid themselves and words cant thank them enough cheers guy
8225909 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8225910 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8225911 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato
8225912 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8225913 una scelta non facile ma lunica possibilit per salvare le vite delle persone
8225914 mediatore e pacificatore per il regolamento politico partendo dal riconoscimento dell integrit territoriale della georgia mentre la sua leadership ha scelto unaltra strada
8225915 si tratta di una evidente annessione di quei territori che sono parte della georgia
8225916 una balcanizzazione su base etnica del caucaso un pericolo serio per tutti
8225917 si cambia il criterio della cittadinanza con la base etnica e ci ci deve seriamente preoccupare tutti
8225918 was supposed to make aid giving more responsive does not address the major issues concerning donor receiving countries
8225919 while recognizing the need to reform the ways aid is delivered and managed the more substantive issues that must first be addressed are what kind of aid what for and for whom
8225920 the only real measure of aid effectiveness is its positive impact on peoples lives on alleviating poverty and promoting human development
8225921 you can have a very sophisticated and efficient delivery of aid but if it does not achieve development then it is not effective
8225922 it must be clearly demonstrated how eradication of poverty the delivery of essential services such as water and the realization of education for all the promotion of social equity human rights gender equality sustainable jobs and livelihoods food sovereignty environmental security and climate justice will be effectively addressed
8225923 we can preface our intervention in justice and solidarity as the starting point of aid
8225924 aid giving should not be falsely premised on charity aid should begin with the acknowledgment of responsibility and with the intent of justice reparations and restoration
8225925 much of these world bank assisted country strategies resonate the approaches which the wb champions privatization liberalization and deregulation
8225926 i agree with csos civil society organizations that the current accountability set up within the aid regime is skewed donors monitor themselves while recipients are monitored by the world bank
8225927 donors and partners are ultimately accountable for the delivery and use of aid to their publics especially those for whom the aid is intended
8225928 not simply a question of opening the books but also being accountable for the impact and the problem the aid creates
8225929 we disagree with tied aid just as much as we disagree with other forms of covering up or conditionality
8225930 aid giving is not only exercised in the context of unequal power relations it is being used as an instrument of power and conditionalities are the most blatant expression of this fact
8225931 this is very relevant because of the amendment in our oda law which allows or empowers the president to waive all legal requirements on procurement instead of asserting its waiving
8225932 this is the reason why we have the national broadband deal anomaly
8225933 most of our resources go to debt payment no matter how better and more you pour into it really undermines the impact and the effectiveness of aid
8225934 debt problem is a necessary element in addressing the issue of aid effectiveness

8225941 tutto quello che capitato nei giorni passati va nella parte opposta
8225942 tutti ormai in occidente si pongono il problema di mettersi nei panni della russia
8225943 la ragione di stato ci ha reso complici nel dimenticare la cecenia
8225944 oggi la russia torna in una condizione di forza soprattutto per il suo profilo energetico
8225945 partnership interesse anche della russia e che nessuno vuole tornare alla guerra fredda
8225946 costruire una seria e nuova politica di partnership dal punto di vista occidentale con gli usa in primo luogo nella relazione con la russia

8225950 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica

8225952 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8225953 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8225954 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8225955 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti

8225959 annullare la capacit militare nucleare della russia dopo il crollo sovietico che invece rimasta intatta anche a costo di grossi sacrifici economici e che ora la garanzia della nuova politica aggressiva per ricostruire il passato potere
8225960 avremmo sparato a obama da grande distanza circa 750 metri usando un fucile
8225961 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8225962 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8225963 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8225964 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8225965 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno
8225966 una nuova stagione di speranza speranza per molti non solo pi per pochi
8225967 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8225968 in the end confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8225969 ive been kind of quiet and into myself about it
8225970 ive got nothing for you on the vice presidential front
8225971 but as a republican i hope its someone who improves our chances

8225975 higher gas prices are likely contributing to the lower fatality count but we dont have the data to say that it is the only factor
8225976 were hopeful that the safety messages that our partnering agencies the virginia department of transportation and the department of motor vehicles are sending out with the state police are also helping produce positive results
8225977 im kind of getting used to claudia coming up with all these fabulous prizes

8225980 id love to think about doing something perhaps for poetry month at the campus
8225981 they cant buy software that stops a dumb mistake like throwing customer records out in the trash
8225982 barack obama is a charming and fine person has a lovely family but hes not ready to be president of the united states of america
8225983 his experience has not provided for him the kind of judgment and gravitas thats necessary to face the challenges in the world at large and more directly today the challenges at home
8225984 the most important national security question facing this country which is iran joe biden has been wrong
8225985 weve got a serious problem and there is a serious question as to judgment in that pick
8225986 his record is not one that is necessarily reflective of the center right
8225987 if you look at joe bidens career he really gets what the middle class is going through
8225988 barack obama and joe biden are prepared to take on the challenges facing middle class families
8225989 its up to john mccain and hell make the right decision

8226102 the government seems obsessed with fighting a losing battle to artificially prop up the housing market rather than finding ways to deal with its worst effects
8226103 they would also save taxpayers the cost of re housing the homeless without going down the disastrous route of giving open ended guarantees for new mortgage lending
8226104 newcastle can confirm that it has received a written transfer request from james milner

8226131 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8226132 he has stated his desire to make the team so he obviously thinks its better for him to be over there
8226133 every player who plays his way into the team makes the team stronger
8226134 he seems to have been on a hotline to nick for a while but it would have been nice for him to have played here
8226135 i cant really speak for anybody playing or not playing he has his own schedule
8226136 you might have thought he would have known that before he entered or pulled out of here
8226137 i live my life a quarter mile at a time
8226138 i was waiting for a ripple effect but it didnt happen
8226139 a bit of a shocker but not entirely unexpected we did anticipate that we would see inflation peaking in september or october thereafter there should be some respite and pull back in inflation we may see worse figures
8226140 i expect cpix will hit 14 before there is a turnaround this is the consequence of exceedingly high oil and food prices although food prices are believed to have peaked by october or november the worst should be over
8226141 the figure is broadly in line with our expectations and i think there is not to much new to read into this it reflects very strong growth obviously i think that this could be the peak in inflation depending on the kind of petrol price cut that we see for the september figure
8226142 todays publication of a record high cpix inflation figure was chiefly driven by rising food petrol and electricity prices a potential cut of r1 litre is being scheduled for september which will provide a lot of relief to the inflation outcome in that month
8226143 next years re weighting exercise will result in a lower level of consumer inflation in addition the mortgage interest rate component of cpi will be done away with replaced by the income which can be charged for renting homes instead of living in them
8226144 by definition cpix inflation would potentially fall away whether cpix inflation would be replaced by cpi inflation as the targeted measure is uncertain but the new measure to be targeted is likely to be announced at novembers mtbps
8226145 we expect no more interest rate moves this year the sharp drop in the level of inflation in 2009 is likely to cause the sarb to cut interest rates significantly beginning with a 50bp easing at the april mpc meeting

8226160 during the second quarter we continued to focus on advancing our long term goals while managing the business in an ongoing challenging retail environment while sales and earnings were impacted by reduced store traffic and increased promotional activity across our industry our expenses and inventory were well controlled as we emphasized cost discipline and our freshness and velocity strategies at the same time we continued to invest in our brands our stores and infrastructure in support of our long term growth
8226161 to this end we announced plans to implement a new enterprise resource planning system to transform the information technology infrastructure for our integrated business model we made significant progress on the transition of famous footwear to st louis and we continued to improve our product design competencies across our brands we believe these initiatives along with the diversification and growth from new brand launches such as fergie and our partnership with vera wang to design and market her lavender label collection will enable brown shoe to become a stronger more resilient company in the future even so we are taking a cautious approach to the back half of 2008 by appropriately reducing guidance and tightening our standards for capital management as a result we now expect 90 new store openings for famous footwear for the year versus our original plan of 130 while we expect the retail environment to remain uncertain we believe we are in a position of strength and expect to win market share while executing to our long term strategic goals

8226189 the combination of experience collectively held by first reserve and the accord management team will enable accord to capitalize on synergies in the nuclear sector not yet realized due to a historical lack of capital and resource commitment to the industry with significant resources in place accord offers the market a new alternative to sourcing material and services within the nuclear fuel cycle

8226203 most people dont know the truth about this powerful fruit
8226204 but tart cherries have just as many antioxidants as blueberries as a dietitian i look first to foods and beverages with health promoting properties to help people optimize their health
8226205 boomers are looking at functional foods as a delicious way to help delay the effects of aging
8226206 and whats especially great about cherries is that theyre available year round as dried frozen and juice theyre an easy convenient and colorful addition to the daily diet from whipping into a smoothie to mixing into a rice pilaf or folding into a sweet dessert such as gingerbread

8226217 the belimumab clinical investigators have done a tremendous job in completing the randomization and initial dosing of bliss 52 and bliss 76 on our original timeline despite the size and complexity of these studies
8226218 they have enrolled nearly 1700 patients worldwide into these phase 3 trials we are one step closer to results that we hope will confirm belimumabs potential to offer a significant new treatment option for patients with sle
8226219 because weve already had a referendum on this issue i think the people will have to be consulted

8226221 towards the end of the year well have to decide what our timetable is

8226245 in the second quarter of 2008 we continued to grow our store network revenue and net income in a challenging operating environment we also initiated a training program to increase the knowledge of our store staff about nutritional products we believe such training can enhance our customers overall shopping experience and has the potential to increase customers average purchase value per store visit build strong customer loyalty and maximize repeat customer visits we intend to expand the training program to cover other non pharmaceutical products
8226246 2008 is a challenging year for the entire drugstore sector in china due to higher operating costs resulted from an inflationary operating environment the occurrence of a number of natural disasters including the severe earthquake in may 2008 and heavy rain storms in southern china in june 2008 as well as the enforcement of the prc regulation restricting drugstores from selling products with steroid ingredients we have decided to adjust our growth strategy to devote additional resources to improving the productivity of our existing stores
8226247 we are confident that we can leverage our financial resources economies of scale and operational expertise to grow our business effectively as a market leader in the drugstore sector in china we are presented with a great opportunity to continue to pursue good acquisition targets with attractive valuations

8226250 the obama campaign is friendly they know we often drive the media talking points
8226251 a couple of people i talked to in the georgia delegation said even if hillary releases her delegates they still plan to vote for her on the first ballot
8226252 obama needs to be delicate with clinton supporters because he doesnt need to lose 18 million votes to lose the election just a fraction of that
8226253 somebody in that office said they didnt think they could win the county they just want to get as many votes across the state as possible if obama gets 48 percent ill be impressed im pegging it at 45 percent

8226257 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win together
8226258 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8226259 i think it could well be said that nothing has so become her campaign as the way she has ended it here tonight
8226260 sen clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment
8226261 nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8226262 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me
8226263 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8226264 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt theres a pattern here
8226265 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8226266 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president

8226268 so if there are ten available spots outside the school that are reserved well make sure there are ten permits for those spots
8226269 that way we wont put people in positions where they think they have a privilege in places where they dont
8226270 im actually surprised at ed for talking about it that way
8226271 ultimately what has happened here is there are 25 000 parking spots right now in the city of new york for school teachers and as of next week there will still be 25 000 parking spots for school teachers

8226280 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8226281 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8226282 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8226283 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8226284 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8226285 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8226286 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8226287 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8226288 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8226289 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

8226356 in the first half we had one or two opportunities but never took them once the first goal went in i thought we were comfortable
8226357 i am outraged that this company would show a complete disregard for its employees safety by knowingly placing them in an extremely dangerous work environment
8226358 what is even worse is that a month after the devastating catastrophe in port wentworth that claimed the lives of 13 people this company had done little to ensure abatement of the osha investigators had not inspected and posted an imminent danger notice regarding areas at the second plant the same thing could have happened again

8226381 many people hold mistaken beliefs about what causes cancer tending to inflate the threat from environmental factors that have relatively little impact while minimising the hazards of behaviour
8226382 the scientific evidence for the protective effect of fruit and vegetables is weaker than the evidence that alcohol intake is harmful
8226383 such a misbelief is worrying because it might deter people from participating in cancer screening programmes which are important for saving lives
8226384 in general people in all countries are more ready to accept that things outside of their control might cause cancer such as air pollution than things that are within their control
8226385 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change
8226386 the time is right to make cancer control a development priority
8226387 developing countries are now face to face with problems that affluent countries confronted decades ago but with the shift in the cancer burden a nations resource level can no longer be viewed as a barrier to cancer control

8226436 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8226437 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph

8226479 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught

8226488 kerb has a reputation for coming up with fun ideas and this game is already pushing viewers to the totally calum best section of the mtv co uk site
8226489 this was an interesting project to work on as we were able to combine an online game with high quality video footage we managed to capture the racy spirit of the programme while keeping the game concept simple
8226490 no matter which of those parties win the ruling class of owners of the big corporations and banks and big business and owners of the factories mines mills banks corporations industries big real estate companies big financial and speculative capitalist companies win the dollar tanks and we lose by inflation but they win by speculative investment the dollar goes up and we lose by having to pay increased prices of goods from other countries but they win again by the returns of their dividends held by them in their stockholdings in the big companies go up inflation goes up and we lose by the high prices but they win because that gives them an opportunity to speculate inflation goes down and deflation happens and we lose by lost jobs and layoffs and bankruptcies throwing workers out of work but they win by investing and speculating in the new bankruptcy based economy its a rigged deck so long as the capitalist system remains intact to them politics is simply another investment they invest in both sides both parties to keep their options open thats how the capitalist system operates

8226495 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8226496 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8226497 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8226498 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8226499 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8226500 con la apertura de ogilvy pr consolidamos la oferta de comunicaci n 360 para ofrecer a las marcas nuevas oportunidades de contacto con sus p blicos objetivos
8226501 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8226502 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8226503 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8226504 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8226505 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8226506 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8226507 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8226508 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8226509 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8226510 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8226511 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8226512 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8226513 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8226514 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8226515 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8226516 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8226517 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8226518 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8226519 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8226520 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8226521 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8226522 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8226523 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8226524 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8226525 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8226526 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8226527 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8226528 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8226529 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8226530 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

8226532 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8226533 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8226534 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8226535 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8226536 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8226537 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8226538 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8226539 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8226540 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

8226691 edgar kaiser is running this permanente thing for profit and the reason he can do it i had edgar kaiser come in and talk to me about this and i went into some depth all the incentives are toward less medical care because the less care they give them the more money they make

8226699 ive got a big season ahead and i want to be fit hopefully ill be back soon and be fit for the remainder of the season monaco is a possibility fridays uefa super cup tie well just see how training goes im improving every day so hopefully ill be back soon
8226700 im looking forward to a brighter future to go and play for an important club maybe in the european champions league
8226701 i wanted to leave them last season they begged me they said that i should stay so that i will come back to serie a and then i can leave
8226702 they gave me their word so they have to fulfil their promise

8226706 it was delightful to play in that kind of performance and it was nice to get my first full game under my belt
8226707 the team performed well and made it easy for me to show what i could do
8226708 i came on at left back late on at liverpool that was a tough start for me not because of the position i have played their for arsenal but because it was a very tough game against a very good team at anfield
8226709 against yeovil i played my natural position and i think i did well but to be honest it is just nice to be out there wherever you are on the pitch i can see a lot of similarities between the way boro play and arsenal at arsenal we played a good passing game at a high tempo and that is exactly what gareth southgate wants from this side too
8226710 gareth has different ways of managing the team to arsene wenger and the training is a bit different but the gaffer has a similar approach in the way he wants the team to operate on the pitch he wants his team to get forward quickly and pass the ball well in dangerous areas but also wants us to get back and defend as a team when we havent got the ball
8226711 those similarities have helped me settle quickly although it has been easy to fit in the staff and the lads are all very friendly and professional and i knew a few of them already like jeremie aliadiere and a few of the lads from the england under 21s so it has been easy to adapt at middlesbrough
8226712 it was a great start for me i think we are capable of playing like that in every game
8226713 it would take a hell on an offer to let him go but ive not heard anything from anyone and i dont envisage anything happening at this late stage
8226714 i have seen camara play against my teams in the past and score against us
8226715 i didnt even know what was happening with him in the summer but hes now here for another year and im sure hes got a part to play

8226762 suppose serbias leaders were suddenly to kill us peacekeepers fire rockets at civilian houses in pristina and storm the town wouldnt the americans be expected to expel the invaders even if the un still recognises kosovo as legally part of serbia
8226763 nato and russia are boycotting each other for the moment but business will soon resume as western leaders see this was a manufactured crisis rather than the start of a new cold war or some cataclysmic shift in international relations when natos foreign ministers met last week france and germany made that point the alliance promised reconstruction aid to georgia but no support for rushing it into nato earlier this year france and germany had the courage to defy washington and say it was too early to invite georgia they were right then and are even more so now

8226770 the newly independent georgia inflicted a vicious war on its minority nations displacing thousands of people and sowing seeds of discontent that could only grow
8226771 these were tinderboxes right on russias doorstep which russian peacekeepers strove to keep from igniting

8226786 the international cup is an excellent platform to build sport and business links with india
8226787 i would like to congratulate the afl for this initiative the government will continue to work with them to assist in promoting our great game overseas
8226788 afl india was formed 18 months ago in kolkata this is a great opportunity for australian football to become a sporting option for indian boys and girls we look forward to the games growth in the years ahead
8226789 i have been working with the indian team to hone their skills on the football field the side shows great promise and as the sport gains popularity in india more people will want to be involved and this will lift the standard of play
8226790 we see it as a great opportunity to introduce australian rules football to india
8226791 indians are now the number one immigrants into the state of victoria and indian overseas students are the second largest cohort of international students in the state we are encouraging students and immigrants to play afl as it will help them integrate with the community
8226792 presently the afl and austrade australian trade commission are partnering to deliver exhibition games in india
8226793 we are planning to have the game played between two afl clubs before an attending crowd of approximately 10 000 people and have the match televised both in australia and in india
8226794 it is our expectation the event will directly support over 30 companies we will build it over five years and take it further
8226795 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8226796 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8226797 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war but we dont want one and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8226798 hopefully people will learn to respect each other and live in communal harmony across the religious divide i pray that the government is able to bring peace to the region
8226799 i am deeply saddened by the news of the recent happenings in orissa a place which will forever be close to my heart
8226800 i was in orissa during may this year it was like a homecoming i spent 10 days wish it was longer enveloped in the warmth of the people who still affectionately address me as didi
8226801 we need to learn to love and respect one another even if some are different to what we are
8226802 certainly god has helped me to forgive he has created each one of us and he doesnt want us to be killing each other unless we give up the bitterness and prejudices the cycle of violence will never end
8226803 the government will take all necessary steps to safeguard the fundamental rights and liberties of all sections of our society and protect their religious freedom we will not tolerate any efforts aimed at disturbing the communal harmony or secular fabric of our country
8226804 responsible reporting of unadulterated truth can go a long way in calming sectarian tensions but at the same time sensationalising facts can flare up a situation
8226805 schon wie bei unseren neuverpflichtungen in der letzten woche mit sidney sam und dragan paljic passt auch kai hesse in unser anforderungsprofil er hat entwicklungspotenzial und gute offensivqualit ten die er uns bei unserem vorbereitungsspiel gegen 1899 hoffenheim eindrucksvoll gezeigt hat dazu kennt er die zweite liga es spricht f r ihn dass er die herausforderung bei uns annimmt
8226806 im telling you man its something about our party the shtetl mentality
8226807 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8226808 his lack of experience has been demonstrated so painfully every time he opens his mouth just about you cannot have good judgment without experience thats how you get it
8226809 siempre hemos dicho y continuaremos insistiendo en que kosovo es un caso especial que no puede ser tratado como precedente para otras zonas en conflicto territorios y regiones
8226810 while some in my profession might be disappointed that i am presenting this testimony to congress i feel that it is the right thing to do

8226825 negotiations are continuing with the hijackers in order to free the remaining crew members and for the hijackers to give themselves up
8226826 they have asked for asylum rights refugee status that was their first demand
8226827 we are very very concerned and are doing all we can to contact them
8226828 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8226829 we remain committed to a dialogue process that is going to produce an acceptable outcome for all the players an inclusive government we are against this unilateralism and arrogance
8226830 he mugabe could go ahead as he says and form a new government but he will be governing without the control of parliament
8226831 the mdc will obviously try to make it difficult for mugabes government by for instance refusing to approve the budget but in our current set up parliament has limited influence in governance
8226832 he mugabe may simply decide to go ahead without them the mdc he will obviously tell other sadc governments that he has been reasonable and offering them mdc posts within his government
8226833 but i think that at least some sadc countries will see through that and will say that this is not a real settlement
8226834 the cabinet that i had was the worst in history they only look at themselves they are unreliable but not all of them the people are suffering
8226835 every call represents an opportunity to identify a pattern of abuse and an opportunity to intervene to prevent further or escalating acts of violence in the future
8226836 we had our holiday safari to kenya and tanzania in oct 07
8226837 i am very concerned that any holidaymaker should be advised to take such a case into court without legal assistance i am also concerned that there were clear deficiencies in the assessment for health and safety which resulted in injury there is also additional concern that the tour company in question failed to provide this consumer with any of her rights either before or after departure it is time for the eu commission and the government to raise the bar for standards for the ordinary consumer in holiday contracts let them start by amending the package travel directive and regulations and to build in definitions of standards within those consumer laws

8226843 ce qui est tr s important cest que le rsa soit financ
8226844 il faut trouver les bons moyens financement il faut trouver une assiette large pour ne pas que ce financement ob re l conomie
8226845 sil doit y avoir des financements pour le rsa quils soient pris sur ceux qui ont le plus me para t l gitime
8226846 quand on aura le dispositif je regarderai ce quil y a lieu de faire mais je trouve quil y a quand m me plus de l gitimit financer les revenus des plus modestes par une contribution des plus riches
8226847 le pr l vement sil est confirm est un bon moyen dexprimer cette solidarit pour financer un projet qui est souhait sur tous les bancs de lassembl e nationale par toute la classe politique et donc par lensemble de la population
8226848 moi jai t lu pas pour cr er des imp ts nouveaux jai t lu avec entre autres un engagement clair de ne pas augmenter les pr l vements obligatoires

8226943 hey look at obama most dirty politicians would be sharpening their knives to stick in mccains guts but
8226944 an ensemble cast is great for the cause that i be able to take an account of thus multitude stories
8226945 and its a astounding way to be in action when you consider the moral chemistry
8226946 despite its name a typical urban legend does not necessarily originate in an urban setting
8226947 because they provide us with coherent and convincing explanations of complex events
8226948 no sound attracts wolves more than the sound of a laughing or crying baby
8226949 wolves are the cause of the decline in the grouse population
8226950 wolves only kill the old the sick and the crippled
8226951 there is legend that the grazing of the rangelands by buffalo has been neatly effectively replaced by grazing them with cattle
8226952 we accept the presence of those wolves only if we are allowed to manage them
8226953 those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens and those who lead many to righteousness like the stars forever and ever

8226957 yes but he may need to work on energy and taxes two economic issues that have been the target of several recent mccain ads obama has a comfortable eight point edge on economic issues overall 51 to 43 percent
8226958 but the mccain ads may have come with a cost half the public thinks mccain has attacked his opponent unfairly while only a third feel that way about obama
8226959 neither candidate scores well on that measure and the conventions are the first and best chance to present clear solutions to current problems
8226960 i didnt have an off speed pitch i just had a good fastball it didnt matter how hard you threw it theyd hit it because they knew it was coming it taught me that i needed to focus on developing my off speed pitches
8226961 i think the big moment for him last year was in the instructional league when he began throwing a slider
8226962 he was throwing a curveball and he just didnt have the right arm angle but the last game of instructional league he was throwing a nasty slider with good depth thats when we knew that was going to be the pitch for him

8226967 race for the future and it wont be won with a president who is stuck in the past
8226968 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8226969 they havent known each other very well or very long and sen obama ran against his wife and theres still some bruised feelings but i think the president and sen obama are trying very hard to reach across that divide
8226970 i think the more people that understands our rich history in the primary the better chance we have in protecting it

8227000 at the same time the apple iphone is beginning to gain traction in the corporate marketplace even as rim maintains a big market share lead
8227001 apple continues to show considerable momentum in terms of corporate planned purchases up 4 pts from previously
8227002 in short while recent changewave consumer surveys have shown the iphone 3g having a huge impact on consumer demand the current results show the iphone is beginning to gain real traction in the corporate market as well
8227003 in yet another positive for apple 19 report the release of the 3g iphone has made their company more likely to purchase apple products in the future only 1 say less likely thus the 3g iphone release appears to be having a positive halo effect in terms of improved overall corporate purchasing intentions for apple products in general
8227004 we asked respondents if their 3rd quarter it spending was on track to date and the results were the worst weve seen in a changewave survey
8227005 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
8227006 with the federal government not investing not setting good regulatory mechanisms and basically taking a back seat on everything except drilling and fossil fuels
8227007 if the haters who said i wasnt a real journalist are still lurking
8227008 i hope you dont have too much indigestion after eating your words
8227009 to come to grips with the fact that he was simply a person with a video camera who happened to record some public events
8227010 but it feels like its much harder for them to make their point now that its how i earn my paycheck
8227011 but i think its understood youre trying to get the facts of the story a reader can easily understand and no story is free of minute details that are also important
8227012 first block of embarcadero six windows were reported broken at 10 59 a
8227013 we didnt see journalist in that description and that made us wonder were we getting behind a guy who was not there to gather news but who was involved in the protests
8227014 i cant speak for josh but there was this thinking going around at the time oh man down with the mainstream media yet it was the mainstream media who was right there to help josh out
8227015 there are very few easy poster children for good causes of journalism
8227016 its less important for people to debate who is a journalist and more important for people to consider is it journalism
8227017 if his only journalistic quality is that he runs around with a camera and films stuff then a whole lot of teenagers can be considered journalists
8227018 the fact is that all journalism is based on solid writing
8227019 and there is no better place to practice the fundamentals of journalism than at a local daily newspaper
8227020 a group of twin cities anarchists now is making similar threats against the 2008 republican national convention in st paul
8227021 weve been painted in that bad light being compared to terrorist attacks on the xcel energy center or chemical weapons or other forms of violence that we are criticized for
8227022 its important for people to know we are not as scary as people make us out to be
8227023 our tactics are not terroristic if anything i would call them empowering
8227024 all that means is you are going to stay in an intersection or a place and not leave when the police ask them to leave
8227025 essentially anything that will stop or slow down traffic in this case the traffic of the delegates could be considered a blockade
8227026 engage in nonviolent civil disobedience peacefully preventing the delegates access the xcel center
8227027 its not part of it but we do know there are people who follow the philosophy that some property supports violence and enables violence to happen
8227028 there really is an open debate about it we are just glad this debate can happen and that people can be a part of that debate
8227029 we dont want to say that we condone property violence or that we support it but we also dont want to say we are against it as well
8227030 anarchism is easily the most understood pol theory in america today so much so that newspapers use the silly phrase self described anarchists
8227031 the media says direct action is synonymous with violence that anarchism is the philosophy with the end goal of chaos and disorder
8227032 i think the key issue is people taking control of their own lives rather than offering up their compliance by being satisfied by giving someone else control of it
8227033 a lot of people out there who dont know what an anarchist is might be an anarchist themselves if they look into it a bit its more about creating an environment and community where cooperation is essentially what keeps a community running not coercion
8227034 its very community based knowing who your neighbors are anarchy doesnt mean chaos in the streets breaking windows all these misconceptions a lot of what we do is community based everyone on an equal level with one another
8227035 it isnt about creating something big but making things smaller making communities smaller revolution should be the byproduct
8227036 its essentially a huge dog and pony show sponsored by some of the worst corporations you could think of where lobbyists pay for access to high level politicians
8227037 direct action has been a part of just about any effective political movement throughout history
8227038 we dont think the political elite will stop if we ask nicely

8227040 nevertheless the spectre of strict regulation for medical bloggers has been raised in the states and what the americans do today we do tomorrow british medical bloggers are as of right now an endangered species unless they stand firm act together and start working up plans to thwart the imposition of such guidance as a matter of urgency they will quickly become extinct
8227041 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks

8227067 the parties shall not during the subsistence of the dialogue take any decisions or measures that have a bearing on the agenda of the dialogue save by consensus such decisions or measures include but are not limited to the convening of parliament or the formation of a new government
8227068 this official opening of the 7th parliament of zimbabwe is a clear breach of the memorandum of understanding and is therefore of no force and effect
8227069 the purported opening by mugabe the illegitimate usurper of the peoples will as reflected on 29 march 2008 is illegal and of no force and effect
8227070 the appointment of senators and governors by mugabe is an affront to the mou and a fraud on the people of zimbabwe which wrongfully and unlawfully was designed to affect and did affect the election of both the president and vice president of the senate
8227071 its a direct affront to the will of the people of zimbabwe
8227072 it was a very colourful ceremony it showed diversity of voices in our community and creativity

8227077 barack is a fine person but i dont think hes ready to be president
8227078 well be monitoring every word that comes from the podium looking for factual inaccuracies responding with whats appropriate
8227079 its important because you cant let a news cycle much less an hour or two hours go with an attack that is a distortion of your candidates record
8227080 el tango es un arte energ tico y vital que va a seguir cambiando

8227082 i mean whats a year when you take the life of a child
8227083 she can have her life back but our lives are totally destroyed
8227084 the governor is worried about 80 dogs being shot by their owner
8227085 and im wondering how many people how many children is it going to take before these laws get stricter for hit and run drivers
8227086 the problem is many pedestrians do not own vehicles so they dont have their own coverage
8227087 the best option is always to wait for police and turn yourself in
8227088 its not worth torturing somebodys family and friends who never did anything to you
8227089 she drove to my office 15 minutes after i arrived on her own and she drove away on her own
8227090 she had called me and asked if she could come by
8227091 the city is bigger than that and i think unisys is bigger than that
8227092 theyre still very positive about philadelphia we still have a more than great shot at having unisys in philadelphia
8227093 we recognize and support the efforts to grow develop and attract business to our city
8227094 although there are currently efforts under way to amend the zoning code the role of the board is to enforce the current zoning code
8227095 people do not want to live in an office building
8227096 but at the end of the day this is going to be senator obamas decision it is not a negotiation this is senator obamas show
8227097 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8227098 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8227099 part of the the problem now is that these conventions are so heavily covered that the images are more important than the substance
8227100 so i can understand the desire of party leaders to present as harmonious a front as possible
8227101 now the media often grades the conventions on how harmonious they are
8227102 if there is any discord thats held against the party
8227103 not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8227104 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8227105 he is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful
8227106 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8227107 you know were democrats theres always somebody complaining about something
8227108 but i dont think anybody is distraught that ed rendell has compared sen obama to adlai stevenson
8227109 im just here to cover the most important state in the union pennsylvanias going to decide the election
8227110 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8227111 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8227112 how many times this season we have been screwed by referees
8227113 this is the effect of growing economy and increasing number of cars with turbo engines growing prices were of secondary importance
8227114 in 2009 we will launch another installation which will increase our capacity to 0 7 0 9m tons
8227115 after program 10 will have been implemented the production of diesel and aircraft fuel will grow by 3m tons annually
8227116 would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here
8227117 that depends a good deal on where you want to get to
8227118 wow i didnt even know that was possible i mean i thought maybe it was but you found new ways to mess up a life its too much youve gone too far
8227119 i didnt think you were capable of that im just so surprised you would do that thats not the susan i know i dont really know who you are anymore
8227120 if any one of you is without sin let him be the first to throw a stone at her

8227123 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8227124 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8227125 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8227126 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8227127 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8227128 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8227129 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8227130 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8227131 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8227132 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8227133 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8227134 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8227135 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8227136 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8227137 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8227138 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8227139 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8227140 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8227141 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8227142 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8227143 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8227144 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8227145 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8227146 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8227147 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8227148 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8227149 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8227150 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8227151 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8227152 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8227153 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8227154 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8227155 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8227156 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8227157 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8227158 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8227159 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8227160 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8227161 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8227162 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8227163 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8227164 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8227165 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8227166 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8227167 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8227168 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8227169 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8227170 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8227171 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8227172 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8227173 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8227174 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8227175 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8227176 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8227177 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8227178 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8227179 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8227180 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8227181 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8227182 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8227183 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8227184 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8227185 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8227186 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8227187 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8227188 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8227189 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8227190 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8227191 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8227192 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8227193 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8227194 yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery 7 429 deviants said revamp user pages and add portfolios too
8227195 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8227196 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations
8227197 it is vital that the international and afghan military forces thoroughly review the conduct of this operation in order to prevent a repeat of this tragic incident
8227198 foreign and afghan military personnel entered the village of nawabad in the azizabad area of shindand district
8227199 military operations lasted several hours during which airstrikes were called in
8227200 having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8227201 i cant blame the afghan national army for the incident as they had no authority for leading the operation
8227202 coalition forces are aware of allegations that the engagement in the shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian casualties apart from those already reported
8227203 strongly deplore the fact that this is not the first incident of this kind
8227204 that killing and maiming of civilians is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and human rights law
8227205 new students who havent been vaccinated or who havent had mumps need to talk to their gp or student health service about getting protected so far this year 459 cases have been reported 22 of whom were admitted to hospital almost 60 per cent of cases have been in 10 to 24 year olds
8227206 this follows 142 cases in 2007 well down on 1079 in 2005 which came after a nationwide outbreak that year it appears that most of these cases caught mumps in third level colleges or secondary schools
8227207 there will again be a less spare capacity from 2013 meaning oil prices are not likely to return to levels from a few years ago any time soon
8227208 non opec output expected to peak by the middle of the next decade production will be increasingly dominated by a small number of major producers
8227209 unless government policy changes world energy demand will grow by 55 per cent by 2030 despite all the attention given to wind bio solar the reality is we are still heading for a fossil future
8227210 given the build up of nato forces in the black sea area the russian black sea fleet has also begun taking measures to monitor their activity
8227211 the decision of where to send aid was made at the highest level of the pentagon and the only decision was to send it to batumi
8227212 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us

8227226 you never know which part of the internet youll need which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iphone
8227227 the advertising standards authority received two complaints that the claim was misleading because the iphone did not support flash or java which are both integral to many web pages apple said the aim of the ad was to highlight how the iphone can offer access to all websites while many other handsets only offer lower level access to wap versions of sites or those selected by service providers
8227228 users would be able to access all websites and see them in their entirety
8227229 the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone

8227436 the election process is on in the state and we expected that there will be attempts to disrupt the process and infiltration is part of that bid but we are prepared as a nation to quell any problem that may arise
8227437 forces that are behind the disruption want to show that they exist we are taking all efforts to see that they do not get a upper hand and they will be neutralised

8227441 the developing world is poorer than we thought but no less successful in the fight against poverty
8227442 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8227443 data from household surveys have also improved in terms of country coverage data access and timeliness
8227444 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981

8227483 there is no country in the world that i know of that supports military action against iraq at this time
8227484 why is that such a surprise to people the reason thats the case is because people believe every option should be exhausted before the military option should be used
8227485 if the objective is to dismantle the weapons of mass destruction program we could probably do that without going to war
8227486 why not use that option why do people want to risk the lives of tens of thousands of american men and women in uniform for an objective that can be achieved through negotiations

8227494 after they realised we werent from home amp away there was this dead silence
8227495 the crickets were chirping and i think i could hear a crow in background so they ushered us up the red carpet and on to a podium to have our picture taken
8227496 then a security guard came up to me and the other female cast member and said can we get the girlfriends out of the shot we were like were actually in the show but thank you for validating our presence and our sense of equality in the comedy industry
8227497 i was like adams the nicest guy in the world of course hes going to say that then his producer called the following week theyve had me on five times this year
8227498 were nurturing new talent and getting good radio out of it abc tv is on board theyre basically looking for formats they can develop into television series the 10 episodes were making now are pilots but im delighted with it and id like it to continue

8227500 i thought the way i grew up was normal until i started comparing myself to other people
8227501 instead of giving us umbrellas for example mum would cut arm holes in a garbage bag we were only allowed to watch half an hour of tv a day until i reached the age of 10 i had to be in bed by 6pm when it was daylight savings the f ing sun would still be shining
8227502 if that was true my job would be done the jokes would write themselves id just sit back and put my hand out for the cash
8227503 were just trying to find out what we wanted to do with our lives
8227504 we just used to laugh about all these situations we and our friends would get into so we decided to do something with it
8227505 but the characters are not josh and i im not that much of a bitch
8227506 i think our friends just wondered what wed been doing for two years
8227507 bogan pride really celebrates the people that often go un noticed my hope is for people to look beyond their fuggliness and see the hero within these characters
8227508 on a more serious note this is the bestest thing ive ever done so if people dont like this show then im going to quit being a writer performer and become something easy like a model or do something with ice cream watch the show embrace your bogan within then feed it a little it prefers carbs

8227515 there are some genuine farmers who still do not want to give their land
8227516 the government has a moral responsibility for them the government is ready with a package for them and we are ready to discuss that package
8227517 its neither realistic nor legally valid i cant afford to roll back it is such an important project for us i dont know why they are repeating 400 400 why not 300 why not 500 why they are opposing it other states are sending feelers to the tatas

8227534 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
8227535 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
8227536 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
8227537 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
8227538 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
8227539 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
8227540 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
8227541 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways

8227566 its fair to say we predicted more drama from a track lined with concrete walls and had factored the appearance of at least one safety car period into our pre race calculations
8227567 i dont know whether thats down to us misinterpreting the level of risk involved in racing around this track or whether it was just a testament to the good driving standards of modern formula one drivers nonetheless we came away from valencia having made gains in both championships which was very encouraging

8227569 as a precaution we readied pedro to take over but despite delaying his start to saturday practice lewis was able to continue with his full race programme his physical problems are unlikely to disturb his fitness programme and we expect him to make a full recovery for both the monza test and next weeks belgian gp
8227570 lewis felt a lot better on sunday but was still slightly sore and tender
8227571 lewis extended his lead in the drivers championship and in the constructors we extended our lead over bmw sauber and closed down the gap to ferrari
8227572 most definitely the reality is that heikkis particularly strong when hes got the car in front in his sights when he homes in on another competitor then his natural competitive instincts really come alive
8227573 heikkis much more adept at switching effortlessly between engine saving brake saving and tyre saving modes and knows exactly when to push so the situation he encountered at the start of the year when he was dealing with slightly more tyre degradation is no longer a concern
8227574 i think ferrari were pleased the sun came out on sunday as im sure they feel when the track temperature really heats up thats when their car really comes to them
8227575 were now entering extremely interesting territory where we wont be entirely certain what sort of temperatures well be encountering at some of the future races
8227576 heikkis much more adept at switching effortlessly between engine saving brake saving and tyre saving modes and he knows exactly when to push so the situation he encountered at the start of the year when he was dealing with slightly more tyre degradation is no longer a concern

8227752 so i dove in and started finding out how they had hidden data lied incredible
8227753 james maryanski from the fda whos never spoken about this in his life spoke to me and obviously he didnt know what he was getting into i think he just expected some french woman who didnt know much about anything and who would be easy to convince that there were no problems with gmos but i had all the declassified documents in hand and in the interview you can see him get quite unsettled
8227754 there was nothing scientific about it absolutely nothing it was a matter of approving gmos very rapidly which monsanto was behind with michael taylor acting as a lawyer for the fda who later became the vice president of monsanto
8227755 and all the international regulations followed from this fda decision which means that the gmos in your fields are monsanto gmos 70 per cent of which are resistant to roundup and therefore contain insecticide theyve never been tested weve never tested the impact on food safety
8227756 in the united states theres been an explosion in food allergies in the last 10 years one hypothesis is that its because of gmos but we dont know because theres no way of tracing it
8227757 there are plenty of things you can do but you have to act fast
8227758 the first thing you have to do as canadian consumers is what we europeans have already done which is labelling of foods containing gmos
8227759 twenty two studies since the existence of gmos show that 80 per cent of consumers want to have them labelled so if consumers got what they wanted and could choose like us that would be the end of gmos
8227760 the second green revolution has nothing to do with food security it is about returns to monsantos profits patenting is the real aim if you look at monsantos research agenda they are testing something like twenty crops at this point with bt bacillus thuringiensis genes theres nothing that they are leaving untouched the mustard the okra the rice the brinjal eggplant the rice the cauliflower once they have established the norm that seed can be owned as their property royalties can be collected and we will depend on them for every seed we grow for every crop we grow if they control seed they control food its strategic its more powerful than bombs more powerful than guns and its the best way to control the populations of the world
8227761 harakut ul ansar increasing threat to western and pakistani interests c

8227770 our work with michael was always about exposing government and corporate accountability
8227771 this film shows how the government failed miserably but its also a story of how people can beat the odds and survive
8227772 those of us who work with michael believe in a lot of the same things the desire to look at things in a different way to look at issues that arent in the mainstream media
8227773 are ones that arise naturally as the result of telling good stories

8227792 were no longer in the world of the 1990s and our schools cant continue as if we were
8227793 todays students and teachers need more than a sprinkling of technology literacy to thrive they need to learn to leverage 21st century tools to think critically and creatively collaborate across cultures and distances and innovate we hope the presidential candidates keep these realities in mind as they build their education platforms
8227794 technology helps level the playing field for children in urban areas where resources are often scarce so they can compete with their peers in affluent suburbs

8227883 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

8227904 our land isnt as flat as others so weve done that
8227905 we have spring developments to get water for the livestock
8227906 we oversee the districts and make sure our specifications are being put into place
8227907 it was obvious to me she was in a great deal of distress
8227908 she was in pretty bad shape when they helped her from the vehicle it looked like they knew what they were doing so i just backed off and let them perform cpr
8227909 i got a call later that day from a fellow officer who said you arent going to believe this but whoever did cpr on this woman probably saved her life
8227910 i remember thinking to myself that larry and the others probably gave this woman the only shot she had
8227911 i didnt even think twice about stopping to help i saw what happened and knew i needed to help it was just automatic
8227912 this kind of situation doesnt happen every day larry had the option of driving right by but instead he stopped and jumped right in to help im glad he did it made my job much easier
8227913 i dont know if its unconstitutional or not but this is how it stands now so were going to enforce it
8227914 ive been working on the bike bridge and the transit garage so i havent had the opportunity to look at it
8227915 the ohio supreme court said exactly you cant do this
8227916 the codified ordinances of the city of painesville violates the first amendment to the united states constitution and is unconstitutional when applied to prohibit the owner of private property from posting on that private property a single political sign outside the durational period set by the ordinance
8227917 the posting of signs displaying political messages is a traditional method of speaking a law regulating a property owners right to erect a yard sign affects both the owners and the candidates first amendment rights moreover the first amendment has its fullest and most urgent application to speech uttered during political campaigns
8227918 since its my property i dont know why theyd have a problem
8227919 its an important election year and it seems silly to have people going around pulling up signs on private property
8227920 i thought it was interesting sulzer decided to remove the signs without yet knowing if its against the law
8227921 i think it would be a bad idea to remove our sign
8227922 weve got more ill put out more ill fill that whole yard up with signs
8227923 if the mayor is itching for a fight that will cost the city attorneys fees he can have the fight
8227924 i dont want to sue him over this because its to no ones benefit to litigate but the law is clear on this and we hope he reconsiders
8227925 a law is a law until its not a law anymore as long as its a law well obey it
8227926 this year its been flagrantly disobeyed and thats whats caused a stir
8227927 we were asked not to break the law so we havent been
8227928 whatever the law is well follow it but if theres people above our council saying we can put signs up they ought to retract that law
8227929 if the good people of chillicothe would like to let us know when their signs have been taken we would be very happy to know their mayor has violated their civil rights

8228025 we have a person who unfortunately thought that humans had no more value than cats and dogs and unfortunately i think probably felt the same way about themselves
8228026 and so what happens if we are nothing but thinking animals and if you have excess people then you can just put them in a bag throw them in the river the way you would too many kittens or too many puppies
8228027 um but wouldnt feeling that this life is the only life as opposed to an after life give this life far more value wouldnt you treat it as sacred and special and not just a rest area on the way to the final heavenland vacation if it were me and someone told me that the rest area was all i got and that i would never leave it and go someplace more magical i might paint the walls put up some curtains make a few knick knacks and have some people over for beer and popcorn i wouldnt just take a dump kick the vending machine and throw trash on the floor on my way out

8228039 we dont see porting a traditional pc rts to console as a very good strategy because the controls by definition are incompatible with the game design
8228040 to do rts on console right you have to develop from the ground up and rethink what it means to have real time strategy gameplay

8228065 you look at these police and swat teams in their suvs and you wonder wow why are they doing all that
8228066 but its ok theyre not bothering us i guess with the congressional delegations and other dignitaries in town youre going to need that kind of security
8228067 not to mention of course especially with the price of air fare and everything getting out to denver is an expensive proposition
8228068 if this were on the eastern seaboard there would be a lot more people
8228069 this isnt the civil rights movement this is not the anti war movement against vietnam and this is not the environmental movement of the 1970s where people came out and policies got changed
8228070 all they see is people getting arrested and people standing out in the streets and nothing happening
8228071 i think if people think they could make a difference theyd pay for a ticket
8228072 theres demoralization among a lot of people who marched a few years ago in millions around the world at that time feb 15 2003 people had hoped they would be listened to and bush would not invade iraq

8228099 small body size reduction of the absolute size of the face distinct supraorbital tori in some individuals a weakly developed mental eminence relatively large dental dimensions and dental dysplasias and agenesis
8228100 important insights into the relationship between small body size and the expression of morphological features generally considered to be taxonomically diagnostic of our genus
8228101 t he only crania complete enough to allow determination of endocranial volume are heavily encased in flowstone which has deterred our best efforts to estimate brain size in the palauan sample see supplementary data s5
8228102 i t appeared from the bones noted and examined that only the bodies of younger persons were placed in the cave the burial that is generally remembered in the cave is of course that of rubak rechiklaus child
8228103 all specimens analysed in this paper exhibit skeletal or dental indicators of adult developmental age see supplementary data s2 s3
8228104 the combined factors of relative genetic isolation a reduced resource base hot and humid climates hilly topography thick undergrowth of vegetation and in certain island contexts an absence of terrestrial predators
8228105 the small body size of african and asian pygmy populations evolved independently as a case of evolutionary convergence resulting from a life history tradeoff between the fertility benefits of larger body size and the costs of late growth cessation under the circumstance of significant young and adult mortality
8228106 the islands of palau are devoid of indigenous terrestrial mammals and large reptiles and prehistoric subsistence economies were based on swidden agriculture and the utilization of marine resources
8228107 f irm archaeological evidence of fishing primarily from near shore and lagoonal habitats dates to only about 1700 years ago although further sampling of early sites is likely to push this date back in time
8228108 exemplify the regularity with which small body size physiological dwarfing emerges in island contexts
8228109 traits observed in the palauan sample are seen also in specimens from flores
8228110 r ecent excavations by fitzpatrick 7 in the northern rock islands reveal that substantial fish remains date back to at least 1700 1600 bp with fishbone present in even lower strata dating to ca 3000 bp
8228111 may best be explained as correlates of small body size in an island adaptation regardless of taxonomic affinity
8228112 t here were at the time no large terrestrial animals so it is likely that the early palauens sic had to survive on only near shore marine resources while this island looks like a paradise these early people who may have been stranded were really living under a great deal of dietary stress
8228113 archaeological evidence indicates that inhabitants of palau were in contact with their neighbors on other western carolinian islands but by the time of european contact palauans were no longer engaged in voyaging to distant islands
8228114 pliotropic sic or epigenetic correlates of developmental programs for small body size
8228115 t he modern human skeletal remains from palau in conjunction with pygmoid populations across australasia exemplify the regularity with which small body size physiological dwarfing emerges in island contexts
8228116 w hile the most extreme examples are highly compelling they do not show the enormous variation characterizing the pathways of insular size evolution and do not amount to a general rule

8228128 pornography films magazines writings photographs or other materials that are sexually explicit and intended to arouse sexual excitement in their audience deriving from the greek words porn prostitute and graphein to write the word pornography originally referred to any work of art or literature dealing with sex and sexual themes pornography is one of the most controversial forms of expression societies have long debated whether pornographic works should be subject to censorship and the question of how to distinguish between artistic works and pornography has perplexed governments ever since they began to take freedom of expression seriously
8228129 when i read your news article on the canadian radio television and telecommunications commissions crtc decision to licence a pornography channel my first thought was what good are they the crtc that is
8228130 i object to having my tax dollars run an organization that is either unable or unwilling to protect canadian women from continued sexual degradation objectification and exploitation
8228131 maybe its time to get rid of both of them the crtc and the pornographers
8228132 ironically northern peakss programming will surely be more gender balanced and ethnically diverse than any other canadian product available

8228142 its about making sure our policies are up to date we have benchmarked our benefits and were still coming out ahead of our competitors
8228143 we are fearful that job cuts are on the way at m amp s why else would they cut their existing policy if they did not intend to use it
8228144 why do people at the bottom get the sack on the cheap while top bosses get large payouts even when they have messed up
8228145 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8228146 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8228147 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8228148 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8228149 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8228150 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8228151 the department has now decided to do a full assessment of the character of mr broadus and the department has begun this assessment
8228152 j rg du hast in brands hatch deinen ersten saisonsieg eingefahren wie lautet dein wochenend fazit
8228153 eigentlich hat es etwas zu lange gedauert bis der erste sieg eingetreten ist in den jahren davor habe ich jeweils mindestens eines oder sogar mehrere rennen in der ersten saisonh lfte gewinnen k nnen
8228154 in diesem jahr ist das allerdings sehr sehr schwierig weil die konkurrenz einfach sehr stark ist vor brands hatch lag ich in der meisterschaft auf position acht und habe mich jetzt auf den f nften rang nach vorne gearbeitet ich bin nat rlich sehr gl cklich dar ber dass es in brands hatch so gut geklappt hat und hoffe nat rlich dass es auch in der restlichen saison so weitergeht
8228155 w rdest du das wochenende in brands hatch als wendepunkt in der saison bezeichnen
8228156 ob es ein wendepunkt war wei ich nicht das kann man nur hoffen bei uns in der meisterschaft kommt es ja nicht nur darauf an wo du im qualifying stehst unsere rennen sind extrem hart sehr umk mpft und da kann in jedem rennen irgendetwas passieren ich hoffe nat rlich dass es ein wendepunkt ist wir haben in der meisterschaft allerdings 15 leute die rennen gewinnen k nnen das macht es nat rlich extrem schwierig und knifflig
8228157 du und dein teamkollege augusto farfus habt jetzt jeweils einen saisonsieg auf dem konto wie ist die stimmung im team nach dem erfolg in brands hatch
8228158 die ist nat rlich gut gerade meine mannschaft hat ja lange darauf warten m ssen wir haben nach brands hatch auch schon wieder getestet und sind weiterhin extrem motiviert
8228159 wir versuchen einfach unser auto noch weiter zu bringen obwohl das sehr schwierig ist der bmw ist mittlerweile an einem limit angekommen du kommst an die strecke und hast eine sensationelle basis das auto noch weiterzuentwickeln ist schon sehr schwierig aber wir arbeiten hart daran im team ist die stimmung allgemein sehr gut besonders da ja nun unser heimrennen in oschersleben ansteht
8228160 wie w rdest du das verh ltnis zu deinem teamkollegen beschreiben k nnte man das als mentor und sch ler charakterisieren
8228161 ich w rde eher sagen gleichwertige partner augusto f hrt ja nicht im ersten oder zweiten jahr in der wtcc er ist zwar erst im zweiten jahr bei bmw hat davor aber schon reichlich erfahrung bei alfa romeo sammeln k nnen
8228162 er ist ein absoluter meisterschaftskandidat es ist einerseits gut zwei starke fahrer im team zu haben andererseits ist es nat rlich auch teamintern richtig gut wenn man einen sch nen kampf hat du versuchst nat rlich immer vor deinem teamkollegen zu sein das baut uns beide auf und ich denke wir erg nzen uns auch ganz gut
8228163 f r mich ist ganz klar der titel das ziel
8228164 du hast in brands hatch reichlich gepunktet und dich dadurch auch in der meisterschaftstabelle verbessert was sind deine ziele f r den saisonendspurt hast du den titel im visier oder nimmst du dir p3 vor
8228165 wenn ich so denken w rde m sste ich nicht in einer meisterschaft fahren f r mich ist ganz klar der titel das ziel ich fahre jetzt schon im vierten jahr in der weltmeisterschaft und bin eigentlich in jeder saison um den titel gefahren wenn ich in diesem jahr nicht dieses ziel h tte dann w re ich fehl am platze f r mich ist die meisterschaft ganz klar das ziel obwohl das extrem schwierig wird
8228166 das hei t dein wm tipp lautet j rg m ller
8228167 und was w re dann die schlagzeile die du am saisonende gerne lesen w rdest
8228168 they logged 127 million page views last month up 66 y y and up from the previous record of 120 million in may
8228169 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8228170 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8228171 this is the kind of question that i predict and this hsteeleas nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at 5 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8228172 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
8228173 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
8228174 there may be some hard feelings but i think people look back on his administration as a period of peace and economic prosperity
8228175 bill clintons place in the hearts of democrats is very secure he rescued us from the wilderness
8228176 we had been wandering there for 40 years having lost three presidential elections
8228177 now were turning a page barack obama is going to be our next president and i expect bill clinton to be campaigning for him
8228178 he will assert that role in any number of ways well see one of those ways when he gives a speech at the convention
8228179 if anything i wouldnt be at all surprised to see clinton give a very strong speech in support of obama
8228180 if pr is to properly address the challenges and opportunities that new media offers the industry must invest in relevant services and training at all levels those failing to do so run the long term risk of losing out in the inevitable battle for the online communications market
8228181 leap and the net will one audition at a time
8228182 go home and listen to music and then take a nap or watch tv
8228183 go for a long walk or a run on the track
8228184 whip out my the importance of having a crap notebook
8228185 its all right you dont have to pretend to like me colonel
8228186 see i was talking to mckay you know hes one of the team so then when he left i was going to
8228187 well you know maybe if youd try a little harder to get along with people
8228188 oh and me doing my best to keep you all from destroying yourselves in hideously painful ways and mopping up your messes when youre done being the heroes i guess that doesnt count for anything
8228189 yeah ok so you saved our asses with that one we all save each others asses on a regular basis its what we do around here if you havent noticed doesnt make you some kind of special cookie you were also completely out of line to be giving elizabeth that crap about being mistreated while the jumper was still in jeopardy
8228190 whatever look if you dont mind i have work to do the power conduits dont keep themselves in working order you know
8228191 long enough you have to hurry the wedding starts in less than ten minutes
8228192 at the manicurist while you were getting your nails done do you like it
8228193 showy mer but hey you are talking to a girl with brilliantly red toenails
8228194 ladies and gentlemen i am pleased to present for the first time mr and mrs john sheppard
8228195 gustav should pass between jamaica and the southeastern coast of cuba on thursday
8228196 n r de fick veta att det var david sj blom s ter d blev det fart p dem
8228197 one 13w micro mini cfl will result in energy savings of more than 50 over a standard 60w incandescent lamp
8228198 dont have a clue what that is but it sounds more interesting than sitting here watching the damn grass grow
8228199 go for a run or something maybe youll fall in a hole and almost starve to death or bleed to death or something before we find you that should keep you entertained
8228200 as soon as i saw the clothes i turned right
8228201 teyla and jennifer no they wandered off awhile ago why
8228202 rodney whats going on what did you do to the girls to make them want to throw things at you
8228203 mustve been pretty bad he said something about clothes on the ground too
8228204 it wasnt my fault though i didnt know they were
8228205 you mean the two of you want the two of them to
8228206 take it easy buddy were just jerking your chain no pun intended
8228207 seriously though are you telling me youve never had a little girl on girl fantasy
8228208 all the porn on your computer is lesbian porn rodney give it up
8228209 you cant know my password i change it every three days
8228210 not that you guys arguing about passwords isnt interesting but id kind of rather know what teyla and jen were doing naked if they werent you know
8228211 um well maybe i just looked a little by accident
8228212 hey you had to pay at least a little price for seeing our women naked
8228213 so rodney where exactly was this great vantage point you found
8228214 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation of doj politicization this congress i am heartened that judge bates recognized that the public interest in this matter is best served by the furtherance of the committees investigation the committee intends to promptly schedule a hearing with ms miers and stands ready as always to consider any reasonable offer of accommodation with the white house
8228215 with that shield of theirs on the gate and no hope of atlantis dialing in i dont see a way around it to rescue the others we need the extra time and better positioning that going along gives us i cant think of any plan that gets us out there and provides that without going along can you
8228216 and maybe an opportunity for escape will appear before anything happens possibly hopefully
8228217 no but it still provides our best opportunity but we need to work together if were too busy being at odds were going to miss our opportunity when it happens i need you to be with me
8228218 off the record sergeant have you ever done this before
8228219 i usually have a girlfriend and the girls ive dated havent been adventurous
8228220 i have both giving and receiving it probably makes it best if i catch
8228221 nothing sir honestly sir im not eager to um catch im just apprising you of my capabilities im discussing the limitations of the plan sir
8228222 the priest was very clear that this is supposed to be a joyous union for the two participants if its your first time theres no way it wont hurt like hell and you wont be able to hide it
8228223 no i know you dont want any part of this bates but youll have to try youre not the only one forcing yourself you know
8228224 do you have anything to use as lubricant or a condom ive got nothing
8228225 all right you know what to do with that right
8228226 then come on i want to get this over with as quickly as possible i dont want the priests to do anything rash or more rash rather
8228227 yes wed be uh honored to participate in your little ritual
8228228 just think of some pretty girl and it will all be over
8228229 well done well done yes yes very fine we can proceed with the negotiations now
8228230 just finishing up their meal in the main chamber hall come this way
8228231 major youre all right they said some joining ritual had to be performed but locked us in here
8228232 just one clarification the ritual was a one time thing right no other teams will be expected to perform it correct
8228233 correct correct we only require one act of good faith
8228234 no pasa nada podeis bajar lo que querais de la mula
8228235 er wordt door instellingen een smak geld uitgegeven aan campagnes en het werven van nieuwe b tastudenten maar blijkbaar komen studenten toch met verkeerde verwachtingen binnen
8228236 of dit komt doordat de wervingscampagnes niet voldoen ja eigenlijk wel instellingen hebben er baat bij om zoveel mogelijk eerstejaars binnen te halen
8228237 voor iedere student die start met een opleiding krijgt een instelling geld als studenten in het eerste jaar uitvallen verdienen ze dus zelfs aan een eerstejaars deze eerstejaarsbonus vinden wij onwenselijk
8228238 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8228239 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
8228240 your one stop shopping for climate change news and views and overall round up of politics and the environment this site serves as my primary climate change information portal
8228241 ove new blog climate shifts is a welcome addition to the online coverage of climate change and coral reefs ove is one of the worlds top experts on the subject his 1999 paper on climate change and coral bleaching helped bring the problem to the attention of the public and other scientists myself included
8228242 the most logical and critical action to address the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs is to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
8228243 although ocean acidification is affecting the health of our oceans the same thing increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is going to in fact be affecting terrestrial environments also
8228244 only a handful of clerks wainted on the hundreds of people seeking applications for extra sugar
8228245 obama supporters have now sent more than 93 000 e mails to the sinclair stations that have decided to run the ad
8228246 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8228247 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
8228248 with all our problems why is john mccain talking about the 60s trying to link barack obama to radical bill ayers
8228249 mccain knows obama denounced ayers crimes committed when obama was just 8 years old
8228250 an appalling lie a disgraceful smear of the lowest kind
8228251 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics
8228252 the biggest factor by far is revenue collection secondly solid management of the city its turnaround strategy and lastly credit control policies
8228253 growth has slowed inflation has ticked up quite a bit and we have a high current account deficit
8228254 in a city such as johannesburg with its huge developmental needs and continued disparities between affluent communities and those that are needy we see the budget as a policy instrument through which we seek to transform our society
8228255 the investment programmes are cross cutting to all the sector plans and integrate and align the capital implications from each of the sector plan programmes
8228256 four years ago when i was 14 i was watching the democratic convention on tv when barack obama made his speech i turned to my dad and said hes going to be president in four years and now here i am about to help nominate him its incredible
8228257 for better or worse and its not always for better it is my natural state i cant help it
8228258 hes manipulating all his little kingdoms and empires from afar
8228259 they have to solve crimes each week that are happening due to experiments being executed by people who are using the whole world as guinea pigs
8228260 spending all that time being pumped full of drugs and having electric shock therapy has made him a little bit unstable
8228261 not to say he wasnt when he went in there
8228262 most of this fringe stuff is actually possible which makes it interesting and scary at the same time
8228263 a rogue a brilliant nomad who doesnt really know what his purpose is
8228264 hes essentially the bridge between walters techno babble and english
8228265 he serves to say ok those are the four things that make sense and then these are the 16 things that dont make sense
8228266 shes straight down the line fbi who has been exposed to this other world and is reeling from trying to comprehend it
8228267 she wrangles peter and walter in and maintains the focus of the trio
8228268 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
8228269 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
8228270 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
8228271 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in
8228272 i was too young for woodstock i didnt really start going to concerts until my youngest son was old enough
8228273 i am almost 50 years old and i certainly dont want to be condemned i dont want to be looked upon as some kind of used up dude
8228274 we created this scene we deserve to be there we belong there
8228275 i think its pretty remarkable that i get to see people that are below 9 showing up at our festival and then people in their 50s showing up at our festival and they all seem to appreciate and enjoy the music across the board
8228276 i think our partners have always pretty much stood by the fact that were a family festival
8228277 obviously lollapalooza for the last four years hasnt been like lollapalooza of the early 90s
8228278 we are a company of 25 38 as well and we know what we were going to want to go do if we were going to pay the money turns out thats who come to our festivals too
8228279 but we always keep in mind that its getting a little older and thats very interesting especially for lollapalooza
8228280 theres certainly some thought that goes into how do we make the event as broad as possible
8228281 we really wanted to have a whole stage to dedicate to that genre of music to appeal to a little bit of an older audience
8228282 in some cases theres actually three generations that are out there
8228283 when i was growing up in the 60s and 70s the music i was listening to my father was not listening to that music
8228284 now you go forward to 2008 and people are still listening to
8228285 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land

8228287 this looks pretty cut and dry black and white lets sit back now and be entertained with all of these type a bitches do with it
8228288 so how long will we need to keep our children in the classroom
8228289 but what if they need to go to the bathroom i have students who couldnt make it that long in fact i dont know if i could what are we to do
8228290 i think if we bought a bunch of disposable diapers we could have the kids put those on
8228291 no i dont think the children would like to wear diapers
8228292 wtf are we really discussing diapers at a staff meeting
8228293 well instead of the kids wearing the diapers i know of a very absorbent diaper that we could stick in a classroom garbage can then we could use the garbage can as the toilet
8228294 why in hell do all of the teachers have diapers in their boxes
8228295 snatch dylan was noways passe in contact with the municipality underwrite during this movement

8228299 we consider bojan our player he feels identified with spain is a great guy and we count on him
8228300 bojan will play with spain in the future although such decisions are very personal and must not be imposed they must be made free and personal by the player
8228301 what happens if they are sitting there doing nothing and they fall asleep do we wake them up
8228302 hey keep your eyes open for 20 more minutes then you can have a nice little sleep
8228303 i let my 3rd graders sleep in class i mean if they are tired they need to get some rest
8228304 he was one of the best when i was in russia
8228305 he is very quick technically he is very good he is good in one on one situations and he can make chances for other players
8228306 how he would do in england is difficult to know i didnt know how i was going to do in england
8228307 he is a good player and i would like to see him in england it would be good for him to come to see how good it is here compared to russia
8228308 we have not forgotten what we did last season but we know what we need to do again this year
8228309 we need to show we are a good team we want to have the same experiences and show we are still focussed and ready to win more trophies
8228310 they are owned by one of the biggest companies in the world so they have money which is important now
8228311 it means they can buy good players as well as finding their own which they do very well
8228312 the game will bring back a lot of memories for me and i am looking forward to it
8228313 i must emphasise that the true earnings of the companies making up our group for the full 12 month period are r371m

8228335 there is hardly any man or woman who has not suffered at the hands of the specific types of women we describe in this book and hasnt at least muttered the title of this book under their breath at some time reasonable women do not have a problem with this book because they know it is not about them and any woman who claims that it is offensive to all women is simply wrong or she recognises that its about her and she wants to mislead or distract others away from her own malicious behavior
8228336 thats why i love the title and the cover of our new book

8228353 gt opening up at hsrc press with adam haupts in may this year the hsrc press lent further support to its
8228354 access to information and ideas is crucial to the prosperity of cultures and the functioning of democracy
8228355 well endowed universities and institutions but also to dedicated professionals and interested amateurs journalists and policy makers
8228356 the hsrc presss open access policy allows me to practice what i preach
8228357 my book advocates open content policies and the promotion of citizens free speech rights
8228358 imagine that all aspects of our life become privatised every road in our city every open field or practically every idiomatic expression
8228359 commons enclosure has often tended to favour elite minorities at the expense of civil society it has been a cornerstone of capitalist expansion and colonial enterprises if we allow corporations to lay claim to every aspect of our daily lives we surrender the democratic gains we made in the early 90s in south africa in the interests of democracy and competition a large number of things should be free to circulate in the public sphere
8228360 i dont think that the one should replace the other
8228361 in the african context for example radio is still a very effective means of accessing people we need to ask ourselves how such technology can leverage off the gains of newer technologies
8228362 we need to think about the agency of people on the ground and how we can facilitate their creativity and empowerment
8228363 many people do seem to buy in to very conventional ways of thinking about ip knowledge and media
8228364 but my sense of community activism in spaces like bush radio is that a great deal knowledge transfer and mutual support is taking place
8228365 this cannot be underestimated time will tell where this will lead
8228366 something which is secretly familiar which has undergone repression and then returned from it
8228367 a constant companion of consciousness a longing to fall back into the maternal chora which is simply put the infantile pre symbolic maternal space as well as a deep anxiety over the possibility of losing ones subjectivity
8228368 we live small lives on the periphery we are marginalized and theres a great deal in which we choose not to participate we wanted silence and we have that silence now
8228369 we had compulsions that made us confuse shopping with creativity
8228370 speckled in sores and zits our colons so tied in knots that we never thought wed have a bowel movement again our systems had stopped working jammed with the endless stress of pointless jobs done grudgingly and to little applause but now that we live here in the desert things are much much better

8228373 crazy he says the drifter didnt even question the fact that a person might be walking lost in the desert at night as though lost strolls were the most natural activity on earth
8228374 he wasnt really talking to me either he was broadcasting like a cheap am radio station he talked about a republican conspiracy about the colorado river about princess caroline of monaco
8228375 his face dissolved back into its previous craziness i felt na ve and middle class for having hoped even briefly that i could bond with the unbondable
8228376 the fact of the matter he says was that the drifter was simply a very far gone desert rat

8228379 drooling somewhat as she said uurd meaning bird several times it was the faith healing gesture of a child
8228380 suddenly i was dogpiled by an instant family in their adoring uncritical embrace this crush of love was unlike anything i had known
8228381 preparing to join the world of trees and their massively parallel sleep
8228382 will fall asleep for a thousand years and when i wake a mighty spruce tree will have raised me high high into the sky
8228383 to help me give because i no longer seem capable of giving to help me be kind as i no longer seem capable of kindness to help me love as i seem beyond being able to love
8228384 the hands that care the hands that mold the hands that touch the lips the lips that speak the words the words that tell us we are whole
8228385 het was een goed plan dat vooraf goed is onderzocht maar gaandeweg kwamen we erachter dat het veel complexer was dan we dachten
8228386 tjerkstra is natuurlijk trots op de nominatie maar hij heeft op dit moment niet zo veel aan een computable award
8228387 as a fellow social historian im reminded of the occasion where bertolt brecht appeared in front of the house of un american activities committee which was compared at the time to a zoologist being interviewed by a panel of chimpanzees
8228388 worthless we might not have bothered but charles work on its own refutes that view from zimbabwean mineworkers to sharecroppers in the transvaal to the origins of the numbers game charles has given us an amazing portrait of south africa that has fed into the historical and literary culture
8228389 silver was a racketeer pimp thief and possibly even a serial killer on an international scale the author tracks him from his polish origins to london and the usa from cape town to johannesburg to south west africa and on to chile and argentina
8228390 only somebody who has spent time in the archives can realise what a wonderful job hes done
8228391 this takes years of tracking and requires huge persistence to find the crucial bit of information thats inevitably missing this book isnt just the portrait of an individual but a portrait of the world through his life at an important point in the evolution of the world we live in immediately before the first world war all kinds of innovation was happening for example the speeding up on international communication that lead to globalisation as well as the incipient horrors of wwi and wwii were being constituted for better or worse and mostly for worse
8228392 he breaks fundamentally from south african parochialism offering an understanding of johannesburg as a global city with all sorts of complex social political and economic connections to the world from that beginning he goes on to understand joe silver and his bizarre and extraordinary career
8228393 but this work proves definitively that we need to understand the city in global terms in as much as van onselen tackles issues of class ethnicity and race
8228394 what is particularly clear if you read the introduction to the new edition of new babylon new ninevah is that more than any other historian van onselen offers a sharp critique of nationalism sorely needed in the old regime this is still needed now
8228395 writing about bain i realise i fell in love with him and tended to make excuses for some of the terrible things he did joe silver by contrast is unambiguously horrible how do you develop empathy for somebody who is so unappealing at every conceivable level
8228396 the book trade and the world of ideas in johannesburg
8228397 one starts out trying to understand the subjects world i desperately wanted joseph silver to be a product of terrible russian oppression a nice jewish boy exposed to anti semitic experiences that lead to a psychological snapping as an adaptation to his suffering
8228398 i didnt start off knowing he was a psychopath i thought he was a pimp and a burglar and i have views on where these people come from one of those categories largely comes from parliament
8228399 but i soon realised this man was seriously ill peeling away the layers of his personality the less possible it became to empathise the challenge of the research shifted making it necessary to become acquainted with the medical literature on psychopathy to start teasing this out so as to understand how different parts of his personality manifested it was a process of gradual disillusionment
8228400 the idea of agent is fascinating you quote frequently in the chapter headings from joseph conrads in the full onrush of modernity at the turn of the century theres a moment when one has to wonder who is what they appear to be looking at conrad theres so much ambiguity what is this agent thing all about what do we make of a criminal who likes the idea of being a policeman as well what does this tell us
8228401 with the benefit of distance the down side of which is alienation he enters into a world with an accelerated set of exchanges some of them underwritten by changing technologies like the steam ship and the telegraph hence he is very well placed to observe the ambiguities and roles people adopt there is one broad contextualising scenario in which you can place joseph silver what interests me more is not the differences between police and criminals but their similarities and how chance and nature indicate which path an individual adopts theres a zone always in all systems including the modern south african one in which the authorities trade information with those who undermine state the one cant perform his job without the other theres always a zone of trading between policemen and criminals the incredible thing is how a character as alienated and psychopathic as silver is his capacity to read this ice cold and simply identify opportunities
8228402 what interests me most regarding silver as policeman and as criminal is how the people that interact and do business in the area of policing inform us about ourselves one is marginalised and outlawed the other is sanctified and paid by the state what does that tell us about us as people about how we construct society who we trust to enforce the law how we make the law and who the transgressors are
8228403 in this book you do striking things you have a dense engagement with jewish history and cultural practices you incorporate careful thinking about that into your analysis of silver and his context yet another facet is the difficulty of trying to reconstruct a psyche through the written record psychological history is a notoriously difficult enterprise so im struck by the boldness of what you attempt
8228404 i dont see this as a psychoanalytical or psychological history
8228405 the jewish component of this book was marvellous powerfully enriching my understanding of the south african jewish history in particular it offered a device to look at how the orthodox law abiding communally centred jewish culture offsets this man this book is not about silver as jew but about him as not being a jew thats not a highly sophisticated theoretical exercise its about reading understanding and appreciating jewish culture in its different settings as it adapts to modern urban society all around the atlantic
8228406 a figure who has had an incredible impact on the psyche of the english speaking world
8228407 martialling the evidence bringing together material but in the long run its a brilliant but circumstantial case you might get a scottish verdict which is not proven i dont think theres enough evidence to hang him have you got any thoughts now on the responses to the jack the ripper analysis
8228408 the more i delved the more my heart sank the minute i had to deal with this i risked destroying the main body of the work bifurcating it and attracting half witted reviewers like sour milk attracts blue bottle flies in high season its imperilled the reception of the work and befuddled peoples minds
8228409 it would have been a total dereliction if id failed to observe that a man with this psychological profile was in london and i neglected address this
8228410 i had to unpack this in context looking at the structure of the book i hoped to present a picture from womb to tomb the final chapter once hes dead and buried offers the idea that joe silver is jack the ripper in parenthesis its a conscious speculation at the end of the entire book that asks one to think intelligently and creatively about the sequel
8228411 this man and his predilections always link back to his behaviour and utterances it is not one piece of evidence that does this but the collectivity of indicators that point in that direction
8228412 it will become the definitive version about who could have done this the whitechapel murders with this particular wiring in his head
8228413 where are the psychiatrists the english social historians ive yet to see a fully mounted comprehensive systematic analysis of the man and his times
8228414 do you see what i am why if god exists does he suffer me to exist you talk of sacrilege
8228415 neither heaven nor hell seemed more than a tormenting fancy
8228416 it began to sink in it was as id always feared and it was as lonely it was as totally without hope things would go on as they had before on and on my search was over
8228417 forever or until the end of maryland whichever came first
8228418 ive got to get out of this place nothing thought just before dawn and the ghosts of all the decades of middle class american children afraid of complacency and stagnation and comfortable death drifted before his face whispering their agreement
8228419 make me into one too please i want to be one i want to walk at night with you and fall in love and drink blood kill me make me into a vampire too bite me take me with you
8228420 death is dark death is sweet death is all that lasts forever

8228432 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8228433 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8228434 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8228435 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
8228436 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity

8228462 many people hold mistaken beliefs about what causes cancer tending to inflate the threat from environmental factors that have relatively little impact while minimising the hazards of behaviour
8228463 the scientific evidence for the protective effect of fruit and vegetables is weaker than the evidence that alcohol intake is harmful
8228464 such a misbelief is worrying because it might deter people from participating in cancer screening programmes which are important for saving lives
8228465 in general people in all countries are more ready to accept that things outside of their control might cause cancer such as air pollution than things that are within their control
8228466 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change
8228467 the time is right to make cancer control a development priority
8228468 developing countries are now face to face with problems that affluent countries confronted decades ago but with the shift in the cancer burden a nations resource level can no longer be viewed as a barrier to cancer control

8228528 during the second quarter we continued to focus on advancing our long term goals while managing the business in an ongoing challenging retail environment while sales and earnings were impacted by reduced store traffic and increased promotional activity across our industry our expenses and inventory were well controlled as we emphasized cost discipline and our freshness and velocity strategies at the same time we continued to invest in our brands our stores and infrastructure in support of our long term growth
8228529 to this end we announced plans to implement a new enterprise resource planning system to transform the information technology infrastructure for our integrated business model we made significant progress on the transition of famous footwear to st louis and we continued to improve our product design competencies across our brands we believe these initiatives along with the diversification and growth from new brand launches such as fergie and our partnership with vera wang to design and market her lavender label collection will enable brown shoe to become a stronger more resilient company in the future even so we are taking a cautious approach to the back half of 2008 by appropriately reducing guidance and tightening our standards for capital management as a result we now expect 90 new store openings for famous footwear for the year versus our original plan of 130 while we expect the retail environment to remain uncertain we believe we are in a position of strength and expect to win market share while executing to our long term strategic goals

8228576 i may even come back to zimbabwe given half a chance
8228577 tourism has slowed to a trickle in the last few years
8228578 it is a shame because as well as zimbabwe being the bread basket in that area of africa with agriculture and farming it was also a tourism success story
8228579 it has been a real challenge for us because not always what the media says is what is going on on the ground

8228581 we have very very under occupied hotels a very low degree of trade of tourist type items those shops are barely functioning
8228582 the wildlife is nowhere near as abundant as it was because of all the poaching and illegal hunting this is all linked to the failing economy
8228583 unemployment is rife so the locals have no money and no food they see the wildlife as meat for the pot

8228664 per preparare la pasta ripiena occorre un uovo medio ogni 100 grammi di farina setaccia accuratamente la farina per farle prendere aria ed eliminare lumidit versala a fontana e rompi le uova ai centro poi con laiuto di una forchetta amalgama lentamente il tutto infine impasta ricordati che questa operazione richiede un certo vigore se sei alle prime armi quindi comincia con piccole quantit per esempio tre etti di farina e tre uova
8228665 in genere questo tipo di pasta si sposa con condimenti semplici che non coprono il sapore del ripieno per gli agnolotti al plin piemontesi per esempio lideale il burro mentre la tradizione vuole che i cappelletti marchigiani siano cotti in un brodo fatto con le stesse carni del ripieno

8228674 you dont need to be a rocket scientist to read these tea leaves
8228675 i think the prime ministers intentions are painfully obvious despite the fact he was the one who introduced the bill that said wed have a fixed election date so stranger and stranger but yes im sure the party is ready and we all have work to do
8228676 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect upon
8228677 its not a question of wanting to go to an election its the reality
8228678 he wants to go to an election before canadians see he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the economy
8228679 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation

8228683 ben stiller is one of the great talents of american entertainment a memorable actor an accomplished director and writer an emmy award winner and an innovative producer
8228684 our favourite poet in the world is robbie burns michael and i were originally going to do a musical on his life with gene kelly directing and anthony perkins as executive producer but they both died

8228690 i left my family at the airport got back to bangkok on another plane flew back to the set not knowing if i was going back into gunfire or tanks shooting and finished the movie
8228691 there were tanks on the street it was a terrifying experience
8228692 er hat einen einzigen magen und ern hrt sich normal allerdings mit seinen beiden m ndern

8228694 well bob saget hands you a chocolate milk that he just made and you wake up three hours later lying on your stomach
8228695 maybe its a male thing but we are like pack rats there was this shirt from when i was 8 and i was like no i might wear that some day but things like that had to go
8228696 kelly had already called in sick to work for radio 1 on sunday because she was doubled over with bad stomach pains
8228697 when she got home she reached up to get a glass from the cupboard to have a drink when the entire thing fell off the wall and smashed into her face
8228698 she had blood pouring out of a lump in her head while black and blue swelling started almost straight away around her eyes
8228699 she was suffering from a stomach upset all weekend which meant she couldnt go out anywhere and then this happened she is fine now though

8228701 thats my blackmail dont eat your dinner and you wont get my clothes
8228702 shes certainly telling friends shes planning to write a book its supposed to be about her allegedly but come on you know lindsay will be all over that book shes the only one people want to read about
8228703 ive shut up about this long enough shes using my daughter
8228704 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realises who the people using her are
8228705 having secured approvals from all the various committees in the countries involved in the trial we are pleased to report this clinical progress on vitortm with patients entering the trial as expected we look forward to providing an update on the trials progress in due course
8228706 mijn huis wordt gedwongen verkocht omdat we de maandlasten niet meer konden opbrengen nadat mijn vrouw tijdens haar werk gewond was geraakt ze was bijna een jaar uit de running en al die tijd moesten we het zonder haar inkomen stellen ik kan op geen enkele manier alleen van mijn salaris dit huis betalen over een week sta ik op straat misschien ga ik op zoek naar een appartement thats life in america
8228707 op dit moment is het extra aantrekkelijk vanwege de sterke euro daardoor is de koopkracht enorm toegenomen bovendien is het voor kopers een interessante markt omdat er zoveel huizen te koop staan het is een echte kopersmarkt de mensen met geld op zak hebben het voor het zeggen als je het omrekent in euros heb je een kapitale villa voor een ongelofelijk laag bedrag ik verkoop meer woningen dan ooit
8228708 in drie dagen tijd hebben we 80 woningen bekeken op een resort als je dat doet kom je veel menselijk leed tegen ik vond het buitengewoon onprettig je krijgt het gevoel dat je een gier bent die boven hun huis cirkelt
8228709 i wanted to get a job in the can before my daughter was born it was actually very pleasant for me i didnt have much to do with sharon stone
8228710 and thank god because i heard she was a f king nightmare
8228711 i am excited that we have built this collaboration in order to reach the smaller drug research groups who dont want to build assets to store handle and plate compounds but just want to receive ready to screen assays from a high quality collection in exactly the format that they need to perform their drug discovery work
8228712 this represents an exciting new technology that allows a much broader base of researchers to access the world of diverse compounds in a cost effective manner
8228713 the assayready4u tm products will be offered via an innovative web based one stop shopping storefront the researchers will effortlessly select compounds assay test concentration plate format plate manufacturer and controls with a few clicks of a mouse thus optimizing their valuable time for research
8228714 i think things are actually progressing better than maybe some of us might have thought in terms of the relationship between the two of them
8228715 they havent known each other very well or very long and sen obama ran against his wife and theres still some bruised feelings but i think the president and sen obama are trying very hard to reach across that divide
8228716 we are thrilled to be working with lgc to bring fluidigms integrated circuit for biology to researchers in the uk
8228717 lgcs reputation for uncompromised quality makes it a perfect partner to introduce the special capabilities of integrated fluidic circuit technology and our biomark system to life science researchers as an international leader in scientific excellence and technical measurement lgc is well suited to exploit the increasing opportunities for more accurate dna quantification that digital pcr offers
8228718 lgc is pleased to add fluidigms biomark system to our portfolio the system will initially be used by the scientific teams in lgcs research amp technology division to look at the accurate quantification of rare target sequences for applications such as health diagnostics and monitoring the efficiency of drug therapies
8228719 we are currently carrying out tests at a laboratory in alcorcon to determine if the disease is creutzfeldt jakob or not
8228720 technologically speaking there is no better time than now to join the over 12 million americans who have benefited from lasik
8228721 there is absolutely no truth to the reports that r kelly received money from a south african woman accused of swindling investors by convincing them to invest in a non existent r kelly tour in 2005
8228722 mr kelly has no knowledge of this woman has never received any money from her and has not been contacted by any law enforcement authorities regarding the matter he will of course cooperate fully with any legitimate investigation of this matter since he has nothing to hide
8228723 i think if that is eventually where we have to go i dont think they can say theyre the least bit surprised
8228724 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and thats something im going to have to reflect upon
8228725 its not a question of wanting to go to an election its the reality
8228726 he wants to go to an election before canadians see he is ill prepared to face the difficulties of the economy
8228727 we learned with you through the media that the conservatives were impatient for the time to schedule this meeting
8228728 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in a space of a few weeks
8228729 in the lack of certainty about an election date it falls back to the government to create that certainty
8228730 if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide any degree of certainty that well be here until october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009 i think all the signs are clear that theyre all committed to precisely the opposite
8228731 if thats what we have to do thats what we will do
8228732 he is looking for an excuse for an election the prime minister wants this election on his timing not on the opposition parties timing
8228733 except that this is the prime minister who campaigned on a fixed election date the idea being that future governments could not exploit their ability to manipulate the date of the election towards their own favourable timing well thats what the prime minister is now doing
8228734 fixed election dates prevent governments from calling snap elections for short term political advantage
8228735 they level the playing field for all parties and the rules are clear for everybody
8228736 the powers of the governor general remain unchanged including the power to dissolve parliament at the governor generals discretion
8228737 we learned with you through the media that the conservatives were impatient for the time to schedule this meeting
8228738 we need an election to provide the prime minister with a number of new mps from which to build a better cabinet the harris retreads in the present cabinet should be shuffled into new less prominent positions
8228739 harper has shown that he only wants to further his political career and the life of his party he forgets a big percentage of canadians did not vote for him and offending those who support other parties at every turn is disrespectful he should be doing his job to the best of his ability for all canadians not just conservative canadians
8228740 if you dont vote you dont have the right to complain
8228741 if there is any humanity and empathy in my work which i think there is i would rather owe it to her
8228742 a monumental contribution and captured the mood and spirit of a whole generation in their reflections and attitudes
8228743 i saw a fight breaking out i went over there and broke it up i found out later that that was yung berg on the ground that they was working on
8228744 im like woah fall back put him out because i have ties in the club where it happened at im like no fighting just put him out leave it alone i didnt even know that was him on the floor
8228745 i went over there and broke it up like stop hold on take him outside
8228746 i never touched that boy but the bottom line is that its all about respect when you come to detroit you gotta have respect or be respectful but thats anywhere

8228778 clearly the candidates views on healthcare and prescription drug issues will be extremely important in determining who will win in november
8228779 out of 12 major issues more than 50 of voters put healthcare in the top third when asked which they will consider in choosing a president and almost 70 put it in the top half
8228780 interestingly across all income levels a significant portion of voters dont think either major party candidate is a good choice for meeting their healthcare and prescription drug needs
8228781 in fact more than a third of our highest income respondents those making 75 000 or more a see either mccain or obama as representing their healthcare views clearly both the republicans and the democrats need to do a better job communicating their healthcare positions and convincing americans they can effectively address the countrys healthcare challenges
8228782 all americans will ultimately have access to meaningful and affordable coverage
8228783 those who need it will receive income related subsidies to keep health premiums affordable
8228784 tns media intelligence cmag data tells us that in june alone political and advocacy groups ran healthcare focused messages 23 000 times in 161 markets across 47 states at a cost of 16 6 million yet few healthcare ads appear to be sticking in consumers minds
8228785 though which specific healthcare messages are most important to voters vary by age group overall themes of coverage and affordability are of universal interest

8228790 das programm steht es werden rund tausend arbeitspl tze wegfallen
8228791 wir glauben es gibt keinen grund dass das mit der schlie ung einer site aufh ren sollte deshalb haben wir ein freies tool geschaffen um das zu erm glichen
8228792 weve had some some i dont know what the word is here in pittsburgh weve had some long games
8228793 i dont know what happened but i maybe have to concentrate more so that doesnt happen again
8228794 you know what i can be upset in one batter one inning and its over
8228795 as soon as the game is over its over for me too
8228796 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie or something
8228797 imagine being able to throw something on the field and you cant be ejected
8228798 this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8228799 if it takes too long this is not like football youve got a pitcher thats standing there i tell you what itll probably be used as a ploy by some managers just to freeze the pitcher for five or six minutes and cool him off if hes going really well baseballs got to look at this thing carefully but i want my red hankie
8228800 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there
8228801 people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball south side

8229018 but barack obama knows what we need to get the american economy back on track
8229019 barack obama understands that we must preserve programs like low interest student loans because thats how he was able to afford to go to college
8229020 barack obama understands that as americans we can achieve economic success but also lend a hand to help those who are struggling
8229021 we could still do some catching up in september or october
8229022 i know personally a number of people whove received the award to be part of that list of which they are members is a thrill
8229023 i felt there was a big future in using magnetic resonance for the study of condensed matter
8229024 the leadership of illinois in defining the american research university over the course of the last century is well known
8229025 that story of course is one that is a tale of individual and team accomplishments professor slichters work and the students he mentored is a truly significant element of that story we continue to benefit from his presence at illinois
8229026 deserving of special recognition by reason of their outstanding contributions to knowledge in the physical biological mathematical or engineering sciences
8229027 we figure numbers for next year both in attendance and financially should soar next year
8229028 because although there was an admission increase we nearly doubled our pool parties and sold more season passes than in the past
8229029 we didnt raise the price of admission as much as gas prices went up
8229030 we were still one of the best bargains around for family fun
8229031 when you get temperatures in the 90s and its really hot and humid folks dont even want to venture outside
8229032 the cool evenings and school starting a little bit earlier than normal might have affected attendance a little bit but we tried to offset that with reduced staffing
8229033 model that we saw with microsoft windows and office a game where network effects drive a winner takes all marketplace or the cooperating applications come together to build value greater than any of the pieces do alone
8229034 as to the violations of standards of practice to my knowledge the certified professional board has not made a finding on any violations the provisions cited above may be relevant to an investigation by the board the court may in its discretion make a complaint to the standard of practice committee of the certified professional board
8229035 the sealing of my mothers file is a symptom of a disease that plagues the court
8229036 if it only saves 100 000 its not worth it
8229037 dispatchers are the central nervous system of the police department
8229038 im sure a lot of it had to do with the election
8229039 this will probably be the first election where development is not an issue
8229040 he said im not getting up to go over there and give a three sentence speech
8229041 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8229042 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8229043 these are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8229044 a colleague and a friend who has served his country with honor
8229045 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8229046 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8229047 barack obama has a different vision and a different plan
8229048 we need leaders who will appeal to us not as republicans or democrats but first and foremost as americans
8229049 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer
8229050 and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite
8229051 the only thing theyre going to do is in old brooklyn terms rabbit punch every day and obama has to show the american people that he can rabbit punch that he can be in that street fight
8229052 i think there was a reluctance initially in the obama campaign to engage in that i think they now realize they have to
8229053 john mccain has a great biography has been a pow
8229054 that you dont know whether i can be trusted to lead
8229055 but im just going to remind everyone here this election is not about me
8229056 its about you its about whos going to be fighting for you
8229057 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8229058 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8229059 senator clinton ran her presidential campaign making clear that barack obama is not prepared to lead as commander in chief
8229060 nowhere tonight did she alter that assessment nowhere tonight did she say that barack obama is ready to lead millions of hillary clinton supporters and millions of americans remain concerned about whether barack obama is ready to be president
8229061 barack obama has a plan to save the dream of homeownership for families whove lost their homes or fear they can never afford one unlike john mccain who has so many he cant keep track of them all
8229062 if you look past the speeches to his record its clear john mccain has never believed in renewable energy and he wont make it part of americas future
8229063 for all his talk heres the truth john mccain voted against establishing a national renewable energy standard he voted against tax incentives for renewable energy companies and for all his talk of drilling he refused to endorse a bipartisan effort to expand domestic oil production because that bipartisan proposal would end tax breaks for big oil
8229064 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement over the issue of abortion
8229065 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8229066 wir k nnen besser wirtschaften wir haben die besseren ideen f r die wirtschaftliche perspektiven
8229067 how are they ever going to prove he isnt going to do it again they cant they cant explain why he did it in the first place
8229068 id be dead if i didnt get out of there
8229069 it doesnt seem right that he can ever get out
8229070 he killed two people i dont care if he was crazy he should never get out
8229071 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
8229072 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline
8229073 californians deserve the opportunity to vote on a high speed rail proposition that includes taxpayer protections and financial guidelines
8229074 with these technical changes voters can now be assured that if the bond is approved high speed rail would be built as planned and with fiscal controls ensuring financial accountability
8229075 insertion evasion and denial of service eluding network intrusion detection
8229076 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
8229077 there are several things were accomplishing this week at the convention
8229078 last night we were successful in making sure the american people knew where senator obama was coming from and throughout the rest of it were going to make sure that folks know exactly what the choice is between obama and mccain
8229079 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
8229080 it was one meth head talking to another about life
8229081 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8229082 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8229083 but russian leaders are guilty too because they kept this conflict warm for many years and tried to use it as a political instrument
8229084 a grand tour de force in highly technical yet still melodic and aggressive death thrash played by highly skilled and ass kicking musicians its clear that submission hold no fears towards colleagues such as meshuggah strapping young lad soilwork or textures whatsoever
8229085 i believe submission has its own trademark our song structures are not common and there is a huge variety within our songs the music is kind of technical but still with hit potential also we have a range from very groovy and melodic parts to fast blast beats in metal more is more and i think submission climbs that demand without losing perspective
8229086 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8229087 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8229088 no loitering no crack selling no cat selling the facts
8229089 persons deeds as a public benefactor does not exempt him from the rule of law
8229090 we thank them for their role in protecting the publics land
8229091 jurors understood what was at issue and they didnt see it as a felony crime deserving jail time
8229092 our existing garages do not have the capacity to serve any significant increases in development
8229093 the challenge is to give us clear direction dont keep giving us mixed signals
8229094 we all would have liked to have had housing but the hotel will still give us that same 24 hour presence
8229095 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8229096 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8229097 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8229098 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8229099 weve always been in favor of using it for this purpose
8229100 the way major league baseball has it set up specifically for home runs fair or foul in play or out of play if you have the technology you certainly should do everything you can to get the calls right
8229101 its about getting a call right in some of these ballparks its hard to tell for these umpires i think its a good thing for baseball
8229102 if there is any doubt just 1 percent you will probably go out there and try to get it looked at
8229103 its important for the right calls to be made in those situations
8229104 if it gets out of control with instant replay i think that would be a negative thing for the game
8229105 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8229106 only 45 percent of street addresses and the continents populated areas are mapped this presents a problem when it comes to developing gis

8229109 im sitting on an airplane after finishing hibernate a developers notebook its rare to find a book on a new java technology that you can get through on a domestic flight that this notebook effectively and succinctly tackles object relational mapping makes it and hibernate even more impressive many books in this category would need to be checked luggage with this book you travel first class
8229110 a simple persistence framework deserves a simple book and this one delivers the examples are well described and easy to understand yet sophisticated enough to demonstrate hibernate in a real world context jim im a new fan
8229111 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart
8229112 i know that i love him i know that much
8229113 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
8229114 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
8229115 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
8229116 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
8229117 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
8229118 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
8229119 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
8229120 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
8229121 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
8229122 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
8229123 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
8229124 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
8229125 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
8229126 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with
8229127 that sort of side of things hasnt really hit me yet theres many levels and layers to everything i can almost talk about it like im removed from it thats where the professional help will help me work through that it hasnt hit me yet

8229145 it should be good were sort of working on ideas for setting lots of things on fire which is what we tried to do for festivals but theyve got loads of rules and they wouldnt let us
8229146 most of our ideas tend to involve setting something on fire so were trying to do it we couldnt do it as festivals so were trying to do it for this tour set roadies on fire and stuff and just see how they take it
8229147 i was a little skeptical about the subject the fly i said well how is it going to be reading for an opera but it just takes somebody that has the experience of composer howard shore to write the music and he has done a score that goes fabulously well with the story

8229158 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house
8229159 and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8229160 they know the strength of america remains the greatest force for good on this earth
8229161 the confusion here is between john mccains rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on sen obama
8229162 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8229163 but confidence in oneself and confidence in ones country are not the same
8229164 he suggested that the end of the cold war proved that there was quote
8229165 for the sake of our own security and the defense of our values in the affairs of the world american leadership is critical while we have our share of critics around the world when people in the oppressed nations of the world need support and solidarity and hope they look to america
8229166 when they talk about our country it is not with distrust or disdain but with respect and affection
8229167 of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

8229206 but im an american its the best country in the world they call it the land of opportunity and it is
8229207 my mom taught us to suck it up whatever you want to do you can do and thats what i did
8229208 it was unfortunate that for whatever reasons the flight crew were not able to talk to any of us
8229209 we really didnt see them during the main situation at all they didnt say anything they werent visible we have not heard a squeak
8229210 no one at ryanair there was no physical presence and absolutely no sense of any sort of frontline communication with us
8229211 some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
8229212 we have been through a genuine life threatening emergency the runway had fire engines all the way down the line this was a full on situation
8229213 passengers sometimes misunderstand and expect theres going to be a surge of oxygen when in actual fact theres simply a steady stream of oxygen
8229214 ive been in one of these myself the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
8229215 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew deploy their oxygen masks and they cant be making pa announcements while they have their oxygen masks on
8229216 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft when its safe to take oxygen masks off
8229217 if i would ask you in response to the same question how fast the american forces can leave iraq for example the answer would be as soon as we have august 19 2008

8229220 we condemn any act that causes harm to any sudanese civilian

8229230 rs 1 300 on state bank of india sbi about rs 1 620 on bhel reliance industries has broken rs 2 200 and the last major support left here is rs 2 140 which we have played round with todays trade so theses are some key numbers i would be looking at very carefully if these stocks break these key levels then there is not much of an upside which is going to be there in the market one would possibly see a clear slice of 5 6 across the board
8229231 so these are stocks which i would keep in focus and levels specific as i said 4 250 4 200 thats the zone i would like to watch on the nifty very clearly so shorting opportunities are possibly developing i would wait it out till some key levels breakdown but if one is risk taker i wouldnt mind going in a small way here
8229232 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8229233 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones

8229637 it is not clear whether there is one or more or whether they belong to abdul wahid were not expecting him to say yes
8229638 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane
8229639 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8229640 we categorically deny the responsibility of our movement in this hijacking operation
8229641 no one declared responsibility for the hijacking all the rebels until now denied the operation

8229656 most of the shop owners have complied with the signboards deadline
8229657 however there are some shop owners who are deliberately raising the bogey of oppression and coercion by mns activists
8229658 maharashtras police barring a few north indian ips officers are marathi and are aware of the attempts to destroy marathi
8229659 they dont let out houses to marathi people insult maharashtra and treat marathi as the language of their servants
8229660 a misconception has been spread that the mns is raising the issue of marathi signboards for electoral gains

8229670 as i said earlier this week substantial investment in education must be part of the governments long term economic strategy this must include proper investment in school buildings and ensuring stable learning environments for our children to be taught in
8229671 the current funding allocation for schools seeking extensions due to overcrowding is 1 200 per square meter or less than half of the cost of commercial building which is currently 2 700 per square meter

8229685 based on our careful review of safety data from this trial i am comfortable recommending that the trial proceed to enroll patients in the second cohort in which patients randomized to treatment with active ck 1827452 will receive a higher dose than in cohort 1
8229686 we look forward to sharing these data with the medical community at an appropriate scientific and medical forum and are now pleased to proceed forward with the next stage of this clinical trial
8229687 we believe these data and data reported recently from other clinical trials support the advancement of ck 1827452 in continuing trials

8229689 this is a very meaningful development for this product given that the air force has some of the most stringent fire safety code requirements in the world until now the air force only had one option now these same bases have access to a product that not only prevents these fires from occurring in the first place but can be installed at a fraction of the price we look forward to supporting the usafs fire safety code requirements going forward and in supplying the safe t element technology in other applications that are classified under the life safety code national fire protection association nfpa 101

8229694 were no longer in the world of the 1990s and our schools cant continue as if we were

8229702 he will presumably have graduated when we return this fall its definitely going to require some finessing and the right balance between taking the right amount of poetic license but not doing anything that would question the authenticity and believability that is so important to our show
8229703 he has too much respect for the fans as well as both actors to leave them hanging like that

8229708 i felt an eerie sensation go through me as i battled to get an answer to the question but will i stand it even when i tried to dispel the idea that circumcision was not painful some element of fear lingered within me
8229709 then it all started with my friends and agemates announcing their intentions to face 2008 imbalu i pondered and called my father in secret and told him my decision like it is required in our culture who later told clan elders and who also met me to ascertain my seriousness

8229713 as surgeons we know it is painful but it is a requirement for all boys here to get circumcised at times a child may feel like not undergoing the ritual but because it is a cultural requirement you have no choice but to stand it

8229733 our strategic calculations show that if the zionist regime wants to make the smallest move against our interests either independently or with america in the shortest time all the territories under the zionist regimes control will become unsafe
8229734 that country is completely in the range of the islamic republics missiles the missile capabilities of our armed forces is such that the zionist regime with all its capabilities would not be able to confront it
8229735 the israelis know that if they take action against iran definitely the capabilities that the islamic world and especially the shiite world has in the region would deliver a hard blow to them

8229833 two things i learnt in the process blood is actually classified as a food and its prohibitive to consume any amount of it that sound you just heard was 10 000 goths sighing
8229834 it is our belief that there is much need for shopping centers market places that are also centers of community and cultural activities
8229835 the truth is incontrovertible malice may attack it ignorance may deride it but in the end there it is
8229836 i am the way and the truth and the life
8229837 for this purpose i was born and for this purpose i have come into the world to bear witness to the truth everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice
8229838 there is no such thing as truth either in the moral or the scientific sense
8229839 if you look for truth you may find comfort in the end if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin and in the end despair
8229840 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth
8229841 if you abide in my word you are truly my disciples previous about this blog lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry because you have rejected the word of the lord he has also rejected you
8229842 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
8229843 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
8229844 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
8229845 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
8229846 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
8229847 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project

8229850 but it did and there is nothing i can do to change it
8229851 theres not a day that goes by that i dont regret the bad decisions that put me here
8229852 you could see he was in true remorse for the shame he caused his family
8229853 he said he had stopped drinking and was making positive changes in his life and preparing for the future after prison
8229854 he seemed to be doing quite well by all accounts
8229855 he was sober since feb 13 the day he was hospitalized was attending church on a regular basis
8229856 the way we had left it i told him what his options were post conviction
8229857 but not to make any decisions right away to sleep on it
8229858 but the key thing is we need to separate out whats helpful and what needs to be looked at and perhaps set aside
8229859 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8229860 vamos a creer que lo ocurrido no ha pasado y empecemos desde el principio como personas educadas que somos
8229861 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8229862 we are on the same team and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8229863 but we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8229864 we will someday launch a woman into the white house
8229865 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the traveling pants suits thank you because you never gave in and you never gave up
8229866 i know were at the democratic convention but if an idea works it really doesnt matter if it has an r or a d next to it
8229867 promises more of the same a plan that would explode the deficit that will be passed on to our kids no real strategy to invest in our crumbling infrastructure and he would continue spending 10 billion a month in iraq
8229868 we want to have an opportunity to vote what they want to do with us is to vote by acclamation its very unfair
8229869 a lot of women who are very disappointed because they feel like this will be the only time in their lifetime that they see a woman able to have the nomination for president its going to take some real mastery and artistry to bring everyone together but i think that from what ive seen i think it will happen
8229870 this is largely much ado about nothing significant i will admit to you that i was disappointed a lot of people were disappointed but we are a family and families have family fights but ill tell you what brings families together is an outside threat
8229871 i dont expect all the strong hillary supporters to be strong supporters for obama
8229872 theres a small group of women who are devoted to hillary personally and to the idea of having a woman elected president who are having a difficult time not having that dream becoming a reality but today we will address that respect it and move on
8229873 i worked for her in 11 states and if it moved me to support obama it should move anyone
8229874 im hoping that will help get the clinton supporters behind obama
8229875 she transferred her mission and purpose to the election of brack obama
8229876 i think the party officially unified and is ready to battle
8229877 wenn jemand mit 40 km h in ein kind rast kann das zu schweren unf llen f hren auch mit einem velo
8229878 this party is united this is a party that wants to elect a democrat and thats what were going to do hillary wants to do that shes doing everything she possibly can to make it happen
8229879 i am convinced that after two presidential elections where ohio has fallen short that in this year ohio will answer the call will keep its faith with the people of our state and with the people of this great nation and when the votes are counted after the votes are cast on nov 4 ohio will be in the obama column
8229880 i think this year youll see a big difference in ohio from what youve seen in the past
8229881 ive said that if you want to study whats going on in election reform new voting machines new laws new procedures new people new issues and you had to pick one place to go ohios the place to go ohio has really experienced just about every facet of the election reform debate thats gone on in this country since 2000
8229882 there are a lot of workers quite frankly some of them union members
8229883 we cant tap dance around the fact that there an awful lot of
8229884 and they all want change but they just cant accept the fact that voting for a black man named barack obama is the only way to make that change happen
8229885 one we can cross our fingers and pray to god that people like that dont vote and the other is to educate them and thats what we in the labor movement are going to do
8229886 shes using the money as an excuse and were just trying to take away all the excuses
8229887 there is no excuse on this its just her blatantly not following what we put in law
8229888 i wish they would have offered up more money three weeks ago but now they may be asking something of boards of elections that is going to create more problems than help
8229889 we are appalled that house speaker husted has attempted an end run around secretary brunner calling on boards of elections to ignore her directive regarding an unclear underfunded legislative mandate
8229890 that places boards of elections at the mercy of a postelection legislative session nearly four months from now when state budgetary figures are uncertain

8229904 there are times when it may be necessary for physicians to set aside their personal beliefs in order to ensure that patients or potential patients are provided with the medical services they require
8229905 it seems that somebody is implying that you need to practise with a conscience but not your conscience

8229921 every man conducting himself as a good citizen and being accountable to god alone for his religious opinions ought to be protected in worshiping the deity according to the dictates of his own conscience
8229922 leave the matter of religion to the family altar the church and the private school supported entirely by private contribution keep church and state forever separate
8229923 i hold that in this country there must be complete severance of church and state that public moneys shall not be used for the purpose of advancing any particular creed and therefore that the public schools shall be non sectarian and no public moneys appropriated for sectarian schools
8229924 i believe in an america that is officially neither catholic protestant nor jewish where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the pope the national council of churches or any other ecclesiastical source no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all
8229925 last year i was on pat robertsons show and we discussed our basic christian faith for instance separation of church and state its contrary to my beliefs to try to exalt christianity as having some sort of preferential status in the united states that violates the constitution im not in favor of mandatory prayer in school or of using public funds to finance religious education
8229926 i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
8229927 our reliance is in the love of liberty which god has planted in us our defense is in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men in all lands everywhere destroy this spirit and you whave planted the seeds of despotism at your own doors familiarize yourself with the chains of bondage and you prepare your own limbs to wear them accustomed to trample on the rights of others you have lost the genious of your own independence and become the fit subjects of the first cunning tryant who rises among you
8229928 declare church and state forever separate and distinct but each free within their proper spheres
8229929 almighty god hath created the mind free all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments of burdens or by civil incapacitations tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness and are a departure from the plan of the holy author of our religion who being lord both of body and mind yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either as was in his almighty power to do
8229930 i consider the government of the united states as interdicted by the constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions their doctrines disciplines or exercises
8229931 thank god under our constitution there was no connection between church and state and that in my action as president of the united states i recognized no distinction of creeds in my appointments office
8229932 i could not do otherwise without transcending the limits prescribed by the constitution for the president and without feeling that i might in some degree disturb the security which religion nowadays enjoys in this county in its complete separation from the political concerns of the general government
8229933 next in importance to freedom and justice is popular education without which neither justice nor freedom can be permanently maintained its interests are intrusted to the states and the voluntary action of the people whatever help the nation can justly afford should be generously given to aid the states in supporting common schools but it would be unjust to our people and dangerous to our institutions to apply any portion of the revenues of the nation or of the states to the support of sectarian schools the separation of church and state in everything relating to taxation should be absolute
8229934 condemn no man for not thinking as you think let every one enjoy the full and free liberty of thinking for himself let every man use his own judgment since every man must give an account of himself to god abhor every approach in any kind or degree to the spirit of persecution if you cannot reason nor persuade a man into the truth never attempt to force a man into it if love will not compel him to come leave him to god the judge of all
8229935 there is not a precept in the new testament to compel by civil law any man who is not a christian to pay any regard to the lords day more than to any other day and is without the authority of the christian religion the gospel commands no duty which can be performed without faith in god whatsoever is not of faith is sin but to compel men destitute of faith to observe any christian institution such as the lords day is commanding a duty to be performed without faith in god therefore to command unbelievers or natural men to observe in any sense the lords day is antievangelical or contrary to the gospel
8229936 i am ashamed of some christians because they have so much dependence on parliment and the law of the land much good may parliment ever do to true religion except by mistake as to getting the law of the land to touch our religion we earnestly cry hands off leave us alone your sunday bills and all other forms of the act of parliment religion seem to me to be all wrong give us a fair field and no favor and our faith has no cause to fear christ wants no help from caesar
8229937 when religion is good it will take care of itself when it is not able to take care of itself and god does not see fit to take care of it so that it has to appeal to the civil power for support it is evidence to my mind that its cause is a bad one
8229938 dick durbin is not only the most popular democrat in the state
8229939 even up to the time that i walked on the stage where they were handing out obama signs people were thinking what is this
8229940 when he was giving the speech you knew that something was going to change
8229941 its not seen as a weird place among us it seems more natural thats the only word to describe it
8229942 it was never formally designated as a clothing optional beach
8229943 people go down there and are uncomfortable some people are uncomfortable with nudity some people are uncomfortable with sex acts in public some people arent but to those who are what do i tell them
8229944 if you wouldnt do it in front of a police officer dont do it here
8229945 its the big hammer this heavy hand of government trying to shut it down
8229946 it does seem states try to play the fence a bit but unfortunately it does lead to user conflict
8229947 it is that kind of vagueness that can lead to conflict
8229948 i dont think any of us expected to see the day when thered be more than 50 percent support for oil drilling
8229949 youve got some of the strongest environmentalists in the country yet this is where ronald reagan had his ranch
8229950 the santa barbara county board of supervisors has always split as close as anyone can on issues of preservation versus development
8229951 i did a lot of research that brought me to realize that 1969 cant happen again
8229952 its obvious whats going on the presidential elections going on
8229953 high price of gasoline and the need of the country to become more energy independent
8229954 but from our perspective our position hasnt changed the governor has been very clear in his opposition to increased drilling off the coast of california
8229955 people want wind power solar power less dependence on foreign oil
8229956 this national and now local dialogue that is now taking place we believe is very healthy
8229957 it is an acknowledgment i believe that the public understands that supply really does matter
8229958 one of the ways to address instability volatility in the global markets
8229959 exposing coastal areas and beaches to oil drills and environmental degradation for a few weeks supply isnt a national energy policy
8229960 a virtual bathroom wall upon which college students across the country scrawl slurs smears and secrets true or otherwise about their classmates
8229961 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
8229962 there are several things were accomplishing this week at the convention
8229963 last night we were successful in making sure the american people knew where senator obama was coming from and throughout the rest of it were going to make sure that folks know exactly what the choice is between obama and mccain

8229971 just about everyone realizes that gov strickland is the key to any real hope of a democratic victory in ohio
8229972 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever
8229973 hes sleeping better than ever because he thinks and i quote americans overall are better off thanks to president bush
8229974 and would you believe he said last week that the fundamentals of the economy are strong john mccain has no problem hitting the snooze button on the economy because hes never been part of the middle class and i would say to him sen mccain its time for your wake up call because we just cant afford more of the same
8229975 you know it was once said of the first george bush that he was born on third base and thought hed hit a triple
8229976 well with the 22 million new jobs and the budget surplus bill clinton left behind george w bush came into office on third base and then he stole second
8229977 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8229978 weve had a democratic governor and a democratic majority in congress for nearly two years but gas is 4 a gallon unemployment is at a 15 year high and businesses are running from ohio
8229979 its time to stop pointing fingers and start providing leadership

8229985 la domanda di revoca formula censure che non integrano i presupposti dellart 395 c p c ma costituiscono la reiterazione di contestazioni gi esaminate dallordinanza resa sullappello cautelare non risultando pertanto ammissibili
8229986 misura cautelare concessa in prime cure dal tar del veneto rilevando che non appaiono ragioni di danno ambientale
8229987 doglianza inammissibile in quanto lordinanza non ha effetti decisori e le considerazioni ivi svolte sui profili di fondatezza ed ammissibilit del ricorso non sono vincolanti per il giudizio di merito ma costituiscono allo stato soltanto una delle premesse per valutare la sussistenza dei presupposti della domanda cautelare
8229988 the stormont executive is doing nothing to solve the crisis which currently exists it is a crisis of the executive parties own making what do people generally do when there is a crisis and major disagreements they talk to each other
8229989 this executive has not met for over two months now and will not meet until mid september this is a total disgrace the executive is in chaos but the parties involved wont even meet to talk to each other what does that say about them
8229990 the dup and sinn fein have been flippant and lazy about the crisis they are in
