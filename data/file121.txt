1210000 does george friends little brother i changed the name have one
1210001 take the best of the past with you but never try to go back to it
1210002 let the free systems of the word prevail dont fuck up what god made perfectly and protect the less fortunate with your mind first and your fist only as a last resort
1210003 when we looked at the 23 tests they were all done in completely different ways
1210004 darwin was right on that there are many different ways of evolving the same function
1210005 sonny has joined us for one season with the option of another season
1210006 in the medium and the longer term they are well chosen deliberate buybacks which will provide once we get some water into the system the type of relief the river does need
1210007 theres no water there for farmers theres no water there for irrigators theres very little water there for the buybacks
1210008 were committed to making sure that we do start to get some water into the river system to help the environment but the fact is that particularly with some of these licences at this point in time theres a shortage of water
1210009 all they did was buy the cheapest water they could to make it look like theyve got the 35 gigalitres theyre aiming for which cant be delivered
1210010 over 40 per cent of what they bought this year was in the lachlan river or north and it never flows into the murray river system except once every 50 years
1210011 down the bottom in the murrumbidgee and the murray the water they bought was general security and there is no general security for irrigators at the moment
1210012 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1210013 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1210014 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1210015 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1210016 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1210017 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1210018 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1210019 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1210020 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1210021 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1210022 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1210023 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1210024 robert novak has announced his immediate retirement following the diagnosis of a brain tumor
1210025 robert novak has announced his immediate retirement following the diagnosis of a brain tumor a prognosis the sun times political columnist describes as dire
1210026 awkward sad funny typo from novak ap story on nytimes com
1210027 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1210028 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1210029 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1210030 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1210031 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1210032 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1210033 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1210034 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1210035 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1210036 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1210037 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1210038 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1210039 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1210040 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1210041 who are open to doing something on the production side
1210042 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1210043 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1210044 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1210045 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1210046 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1210047 i dont agree with you about the usefulness of this or that text for the reconstruction of history
1210048 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1210049 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1210050 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1210051 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1210052 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1210053 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1210054 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1210055 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1210056 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1210057 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1210058 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1210059 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1210060 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1210061 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1210062 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1210063 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1210064 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1210065 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1210066 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1210067 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1210068 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1210069 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1210070 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1210071 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1210072 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1210073 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1210074 what i see in jerry is a strong desire to know and understand the word of god with a zeal to share it using it often to correct rebuke teach admonish edify and encourage
1210075 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1210076 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1210077 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1210078 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1210079 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1210080 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1210081 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1210082 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1210083 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1210084 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1210085 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1210086 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1210087 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1210088 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1210089 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1210090 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1210091 at least i know ive got a job for the next three years
1210092 i signed a couple of weeks ago luckily because my last two games havent been that great
1210093 i got in at the right time and held the club to ransom and everything so it was good
1210094 at the moment simmo skipper adam simpson we cant shake him at the moment hes 32 and hes still going
1210095 his experience and character and leadership ability that hes shown at the footy club during his time here hed be the next candidate in front of anyone else
1210096 your first years of footy you can come in and fly under the radar a bit maybe get a couple of kicks and those middle stages are when youre probably still a bit immature
1210097 i probably didnt realise that until the last couple of years that playing footy consistently every week is really hard
1210098 now i think ive got a firm grip on things and i understand whats involved each week
1210099 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal
1210100 for where your treasure is there will your heart also be
1210101 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is good and acceptable and perfect will of god
1210102 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness
1210103 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things
1210104 i believe not having the pools has robbed me of an opportunity
1210105 the community would have benefited a lot from the pool because it would have taken some kids away from the streets
1210106 is a life saving skill that i believe every child is entitled to i dont think its a luxury i believe its an entitlement
1210107 i am going to stay principal until i fix that pool i have to do this
1210108 i was hoping to learn to swim here because we have a pool but then i found out it was closed so ill wait until college
1210109 me not knowing how to swim any depth of water still scares me
1210110 the pool issue was something that the school always brought up because everyone was aware we had one
1210111 so it was just something that we had to personally go to the department of ed and bring up to them
1210112 remember were talking about working class people there isnt a whole lot of money

1210120 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1210121 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1210122 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1210123 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1210124 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1210125 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1210126 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1210127 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1210128 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1210129 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

1210134 this is surprising since an earlier thermal and evolved gas analyser measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate

1210147 a dream that will come true is not a real dream
1210148 we are also a political party we have our own strength we have our own supporters who have given us the mandate we have long enough experience of 50 years being in the countrys political scene
1210149 of course we would not let ourselves into something that would fool us we are not that na ve im perplexed as to why people think pas should not be talking with the others is pas that bad we cant even talk with each other
1210150 the muzakarah is to address issues which both parties could share as muslims for the nation as a whole there are no specific issues we are looking at issues which concerned the ummah current issues old issues unresolved issues
1210151 we expect something good for islam out of the meetings something good for the struggle of pas as an islamic party if we dont take up this opportunity this could mean we are neglecting our responsibility
1210152 there are many other things we can do for the ummah dont be too shallow or negative dont think only about crossing over or power sharing
1210153 we were tasked to explore more specific issues we can look into if they arise in future this is to maintain silaturrahim good relationship with fellow muslims but people see it as if we cannot be friends with others
1210154 yes during the first talks they umno made so many offers but we rejected them from the very beginning and during the subsequent meetings the matter was not brought up at all if we were really greedy for power we would have already accepted it but we insisted we wish to remain in pakatan rakyat
1210155 this is a major milestone we can share with our sport and broadcast partners who worked closely with us to develop a balanced games schedule that satisfies the respective international sport federations ifs television audiences around the world and spectators who will attend the games
1210156 as with all games the schedule will maintain a degree of flexibility in timing however now that the overall schedule has been refined we know it will be of great interest to spectators so they can plan their activities but its also a key planning document for others broadcasters and service providers can begin to hone their plans for 2010 our team can start finalizing all crucial systems to ensure an exemplary experience for all and perhaps most importantly the worlds greatest winter athletes can further develop their game plans as they prepare to perform on the worlds largest stage in 2010

1210170 more often than not the obama campaign is discussed as the home team

1210172 aim of new unity initiative is more diversity in top media management
1210173 with more than 50 percent of the population projected to be people of color in less than a generation

1210182 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction

1210841 i think the fed is going to stand on the sidelines holding at 2 0 percent were getting a very mixed economic picture right now
1210842 i think the housing market is really the central element of this crisis
1210843 yes consumer price increases are so high that the inflation hawks will be screeching like crazy at tomorrows fomc meeting expect some strong language about inflation in the statement but no action
1210844 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside

1210846 i wish my victims would know how truly sorry i am and how none of what happened was their fault
1210847 it was a process it seems a well thought out process that starts as friendship
1210848 im bitter man and you cant make eye contact with anyone man
1210849 i got a letter from gary underwood that stated graphically how im attracted to you
1210850 its like a prisoner of war type thing you put it in a place and you hope that door never opens
1210851 the counselors told me without a doubt this is a result of what was happening to me and what gary underwood did to me
1210852 i do the best that i can but at the same time theres always something in the back of my head i always have to be numbed somehow so i can forget and if i dont im even worse
1210853 the focus of the market is on prospects of a future rate hike
1210854 if theres any word suggesting a rate hike in the feds statement the dollar will rise
1210855 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
1210856 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
1210857 no further evacuations are planned at this time and based on current information and forecast we do not expect any impact on shell operated production in the gulf of mexico
1210858 exxonmobil is determining which of its facilities may potentially be in the path of the storm preparing those structures for heavy wind and rain and identifying personnel for possible evacuation to shore
1210859 currently there is no impact to production and no personnel have been evacuated
1210860 at the moment people are taking the view that the glass is half empty rather than half full
1210861 rather than looking at the positive side that weaker commodities take the pressure off inflation people are seeing it as a product of slower growth
1210862 slowing demand and the hope for more supply is weighing on the market even as the geopolitics and the weather is getting wild
1210863 do you have the guts to follow through and make this happen
1210864 its too bad we dont have another local paper to give us another angle

1210891 as long as theres one american kid over there im voting the money for these things
1210892 its the one way we can save lives before getting them out
1210893 seventy percent of all the kids killed or wounded are from ieds
1210894 if you can extend life expectancy by 80 percent by having mraps how can you not fund it
1210895 from march of 2003 to july 19 2007 if wed had mrap vehicles in iraq its reasonable to say that between 938 and 1 120 americans who were killed by ieds would still be alive
1210896 but some things are worth losing elections over this is one
1210897 for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh this is a profound mystery but i am talking about christ and the church
1210898 we believe that the strength of a nation depends upon the strength of its families weve already seen the results of redefining the concept of marriage over the last few decades do we want to continue experimenting are we better off morally and spiritually as a nation can our nation survive the social re engineering of its most basic unit marriage if you want to catch one glimpse of what could be our future look no further than scandanavia
1210899 any activity within our power that we engage in to enable us to do what we cannot do by direct effort
1210900 that art which owes its continuous evolution to the apollonian dionysiac duality
1210901 i no longer call you servants i have called you friends
1210902 philosophy is about the life and death issues that matter most
1210903 finally in terms of my own experience of these last 25 years after the republic i translated rousseaus emile the greatest modern book on education rousseau was one of the great readers of plato as was nietzsche my interjection and from my time on that work i gained an even greater respect for the republic emile is its natural companion if one takes these two books together one has the basic training necessary for the educational wars and wars they are now that doctrine tells us that these two books are cornerstones of an outlived canon
1210904 if there is a great interval of virtue or vice or wealth or anything else between the parties then they are no longer friends and this is most manifest in the case of the gods for they surpass us most decisively in all good things m uch can be taken away and friendship remain but when one party is removed to a great distance as the god is the possibilty of friendship ceases
1210905 asked what is the friend he answered one psyche dwelling in two bodies
1210906 can we really say that we would allow this to happen if it was happening anywhere else but africa
1210907 when we are the sum of our wants we are easily used by others
1210908 i have come to change the government not to praise it
1210909 those who disagree with me are racist and want to destroy the
1210910 if i persuade someone to profess faith in christ and i havent learnt anything from that person then all i have done is gotten someone to say something no conversion has happened for if we cant see the goodness in peoples lives now we cant envision any path from their current life to one of greater godliness
1210911 good works which god prepared in advance for us to do
1210912 if i persuade someone to profess faith in christ and i havent learnt anything from that person then all i have done is gotten someone to say something no conversion has happened
1210913 if we cant see the goodness in peoples lives now we cant envision any path from their current life to one of greater godliness
1210914 calvinists have held that the sin of adam was immediately imputed to the whole human family so that not only is the entire race depraved but also guilty on account of the first transgression
1210915 sinned translates a greek aorist tense indicating that at one point in time all men sinned
1210916 god has redeemed me from my sin he has not redeemed me from adams
1210917 is trying to be a good person good enough if goodness is the presence of god and thus the path to greater godliness i would be compelled to say yes
1210918 lord i realize that i cant be a good person on my own effort i just cant im sorry for being so selfish as to try lord i no longer want to reject you and today right now again i turn my life over to you i turn my pain my failure over to you and seek to live no longer on my own strength but on the strength of your spirit in me amen
1210919 you will gain character because honesty will reach out from deep inside you and tattoo itself across your face
1210920 be sure not to do your rightness before human beings with the intent of being seen by them otherwise your father the one in the heavens will have nothing to do with it
1210921 my strong presumption is that these areas of confusion are likely due to misunderstanding on my side
1210922 the task of confessing the faith in the context of the particular circumstances and challenges in which it is situated
1210923 think of the way aristotle unveils natures in physics ii nature is the bottomless depth that manifests itself in the concrete life histories of things it is what makes things intelligible yes but with an intelligibility indwelt by an irreducible inexhaustible mystery the dearest freshness deep down things as hopkins says that is why it can give rise to the wonder that according to aristotle is the source of philosophy and that for me is key not to oppose intelligibility and mystery
1210924 the finitude of man which i affirm is not rooted in any limitations in being human as nietzsche and heidegger supposed but in the always partial disclosure of being within any period of time which aristotle and aquinas supposed
1210925 please lord bring the day when we no longer think in these terms
1210926 and now i know why this friend of mine has always appealed to me so greatly and why kierkegaard is bugging me to read more of his work
1210927 ethan on off on off on off on off wait why isnt it turning on water about to hit the floor better get a towel laugh
1210928 i believe in jesus christ but i dont believe in religion wtf is it possable to have a non religious christian that gos too church or have they finally realized there product the bible in unsellable to th masses
1210929 do you think a 30 minute sermon once per week is what you should rely upon for your spiritual growth
1210930 i guess you wont be seeing much of him for awhile
1210931 are you ready to not see much of each other for two years
1210932 how can i contribute to the mission of this community
1210933 what i would say is this you dont have to buy anything you dont want we must understand that belief is something that comes along as you experience you dont have to fake anything the way faith works is this you put into practice what you believe if youre attracted to jesus what do you believe about him that you can act on experience shows again and again that when you allow people to act on the little that they do believe the rest will follow
1210934 no good tree bears bad fruit nor does a bad tree bear good fruit
1210935 greater love has no one than this that he lay his life down for his friends you are my friends if you do what i command i no longer call you servants because a servant does not know his masters business instead i have called you friends for everything i have learned from my father i have made known to you
1210936 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
1210937 does your letter in the times this week imply that you are calling for the resignation of the abc
1210938 no i am not suggesting that the archbishop of canterbury should resign and for the record it was the times of london that approached me about writing an essay on why the church of uganda bishops were not attending lambeth
1210939 it seems to me that the maturing of the global nature of the anglican communion beyond its colonial beginnings would involve separating the role of the spiritual leader of the communion from that of the primate of all england
1210940 however i do think its time to realise that the anglican communion is no longer an extension of the church of england
1210941 and may i just add that i agree with archbishop rowan and others when he says that
1210942 but what we in the global south have strongly maintained is this when you are known to be the
1210943 the crisis in the communion is about authority biblical authority and ecclesiastical authority
1210944 it seems to me that the functions proposed for the pastoral forum are exactly what the primates of the communion have been charged to do
1210945 exercise an enhanced responsibility in offering guidance on doctrinal moral and pastoral matters
1210946 descartes 1596 1650 observed that an increasing number of his intellectual friends no longer bought into premodern epistemology in fact some of them were closet atheists as a devout roman catholic descartes wanted to be able to convince them of the truth of catholicism but found the common givens where too few to make significant progress in discussions with them
1210947 the relative freedom from monolithic ecclesiastical control achieved by the magisterial reformation
1210948 we should be concerned only with those objects regarding which our minds seem capable of obtaining certain and indubitable knowledge
1210949 t his truth i think therefore i am was so firm and sure that i decided that i could accept it without scrupple as the first principle of the philosophy i was seeking i knew i was a substance whose whole essence or nature was to think
1210950 these six meditations contain all the foundations of my physics but please do not tell people for that might make it harder for supporters of aristotle to approve them i hope that readers will gradually get used to my principles and recognize their truth before they notice that they destroy the principles of aristotle
1210951 its that by beginning with i the foundation is so unstable
1210952 s cholars who think of themselves as belonging in some sense to the postmodern camp tend at this point to divide into two camps on the one side are those who conclude that we human beings cannot have objective knowledge about anything all we can ever sensibly mean by truth is what is true for some individual or group let us call this position hard or strong postmodernism on the other side are those who admit that although human knowledge is necessarily perspectival we human beings can in measure approach the truth in some objective sense how they reach this conclusion we shall think about in a moment let us call this position soft or weak postmodernism i hold that it is possible and reasonable to speak of finite human beings knowing some things truly even if nothing exhaustively or omnisciently
1210953 but as soon as i had completed this entire course of study at the end of which one is ordinarily received into the ranks of the learned i completely changed my mind for i found myself confounded by so many doubts and errors that it seemed to me that i had not gained any profit from my attempt to teach myself except that more and more i had discovered my ignorance
1210954 this means that for the premoderns epistemology does not begin with the self with me it begins with god
1210955 ive always known that but here it is clarified really well
1210956 in other words the emerging church has numerous strengths and we should be grateful for them but they are not exclusively theirs in fact i could list a substantial number of local churches that share the strengths of the movement but would not want to be identified with it
1210957 criticism of a primarily pastoral movement called the emerging church for what is a failure of academics
1210958 hey were just doing pastoral work dont expect us to understand the historical theological philosophical implications of what were preaching
1210959 while those involved acknowledged conversations between brett favre and vikings coaches none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1210960 we respect the commissioners decision and the thoroughness of the process we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making our focus has been and continues to be on our football team and having a successful season
1210961 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1210962 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1210963 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
1210964 it was freezing and we had a laugh but it would not have been funny if someone died
1210965 okay well take manny off your hands for you but you have to pay his salary pay for the draft picks well get when we dont re sign him pay mr lorias mortgage and build us a new stadium oh and were not giving you anything in return either deal
1210966 the first time that the issue of interrogations comes up

1210968 what part of role playing exactly leads people into these hornets nests of insanity

1210977 its been a pleasure to get to watch you sing
1210978 you cannot practice and become the kind of singer you are its a god given gift you are using your gift to the best of your abilities and everybody is recognizing you for it right now
1210979 it is so awesome to see you in the final two of this show
1210980 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1210981 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1210982 the prospering of gods cause on earth depends upon his people thinking well
1210983 the most important contribution phenomenology has made to culture and the intellectual life is to have validated the truth of prephilosophical life experience and thinking it insists that the exercises of reason that are carried out in the natural attitude everyday life are valid and true truth is achieved before philosophy comes on the scene
1210984 inner experience and it alone is decisive here shows nothing of such creative processes our mental activity does not make relations they are simply there and given an appropriate direction of interest they are just as noticeable as any other type of content strictly speaking creative acts that produce some new content as a result distinct from them are psychological monstrosities
1210985 it is not the case that we can think because we have language rather we have language because we can think
1210986 it is precisely because concepts do not confer a new characteristic or nature upon the object of the thought or cognition that we are not locked inside thought or language and faced with the futile task of finding something unmodified by thought or language the riddle of objectivity is the result of a massive misunderstanding and misdescription of subjectivity thought
1210987 true vanhoozer states and i applaud it that language does not bar us from reality but he adds as a part of the same sentence though reality comes mediated by language the problem is how to spell out this latter clause in such a way that the former can be true how to have mediation without modification if in his clauses we replace the word language with the word experience or consciousness or even thought we find our location in the problematic of modern thought persisting ever since descartes discovered consciousness once you discover it you get out only by a miracle
1210988 abandoning the investigation of being modern philosophical research has concentrated instead upon human knowing rather than make use of the human capacity to know the truth modern philosophy has preferred to accentuate the ways in which this capacity is limited and conditioned
1210989 human language may be conditioned by history and constricted in other ways but the human being can still express truths which surpass the phenomenon of language
1210990 we can be thankful that god did not give the multiplication tables to moses because then we would not be able to teach them in our public schools
1210991 the reaction on the part of fundamentalism was mistakenly to attack reason
1210992 historically conservative christians became suspicious of any talk of jesus as teacher because liberals or modernists used it as a way of saying that he was not the divine son and supernatural savior but just a good man
1210993 almost no one would consider jesus to be a thinker addressing the same issues as say aristotle kant heidegger or wittgenstein and with the same logical method
1210994 it is often said that we no longer live in the world the bible talks about that the world defined by the bible and taken for granted by it is not congruent with ours
1210995 we and our contemporaries are less different from the corinthians or the thessalonians than the corinthians and the thessalonians were from those who knew christ directly
1210996 are the expression of necessities that men encounter in the world necessities that men must respect
1210997 the poets were theologians who would reinterpret the myths and formulate shifts of position and of relation among the gods and the other mythical beings to bring out new aspects of what had to be aspects that different circumstances or greater insight permitted to come into view
1210998 in a certain sense his first initiation to phenomenology came about indirectly and outside of orthodox philosophy through the theory of theater
1210999 no you dont have to certain about anything youre not certain about in fact certainty is not something you can choose anyway certainty and uncertainty are not things that are under the will
1211000 you are telling me i could be a christian and still have doubts
1211001 i can acknowledge that you know i have read the gospels and i think that jesus was the greatest teacher there ever was in fact id like to live my life like him but it feels like i have to buy an awful lot more
1211002 the pharisee takes as his aim keeping the law rather than becoming the kind of person whose deeds naturally conform to the law
1211003 t he present undertaking is not for the sake of theory as our others are for we are not inquiring into what excellence is for the sake of knowing it but for the sake of becoming good since otherwise there would be no benefit in it at all
1211004 on the directive or subservient role of reason in ethics
1211005 in each of his actions the human person is eyewitness of the transition from the is to the should the transition from x is truly good to i should do x
1211006 you are who you are not who you would be if the system was different
1211007 philosophers have often had a too limited understanding of what makes us rational they have taken our rationality as primarily the power to abstract universal concepts from particular experiences the power to carry on syllogistic reasoning and the power to have insight into self evident truths
1211008 how concepts relate the mind to its objects the gods eye view vindicated
1211009 aeschylus has prometheus admit that he both brought fire to men and that he also hid from men the time and circumstances of their death because men henceforth did not know the day they were to die they were caught in a combination of certainty and ignorance they knew that they must die but they did not know when or how this combination of assurance and blindness is necessary to men as a spur to use fire and all that fire allows to hold off death as long as possible
1211010 wojtylas poetical reflections always accompany philosophic reflections and on some decisive points precede it it is noteworthy for example that love and responsibility was published in the same year as the jewellers shop the latter is a poetic reflection on the identical problem discussed in the former so much so that the interpretation of the philosophical text is enriched if one reads it alongside the poetic text
1211011 here i submit is the fundamental distinction within moral phenomena the one which is of primary human interest and from which all the others moving toward the periphery of the moral life and ethical theory can be clarified
1211012 how reason can survive the modern university the moral foundations of rationality

1211086 to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
1211087 there is nothing in that language that the plaintiff must demonstrate a transfer

1211096 we applaud the fcc for taking enforcement action against comcast
1211097 we commend free press public knowledge and the other groups who pursued the complaint against comcast we also applaud aclu activists and the public for speaking out at field hearings and sending in thousands of personal comments about comcasts illegal practices
1211098 todays fcc penalty against comcast is a step forward toward freedom on the net we urge the commissioners to remain vigorous in their defense of consumers rights and the open internet
1211099 kevin martin deserves credit in this case for leading the commission to limit comcasts abuse of the internet but commission decisions are only as permanent as the commissioners who voted for them and we are far from a point where we can all relax secure in the knowledge that the internet as we have always known it is safe more needs to be done soon power will change hands in washington and we urge party leaders to nominate fcc commissioners who will make it a priority to restore and protect network neutrality principles the aclu will continue to work towards legislation that will free the internet from corporate censorship and the fleeting policy decisions that accompany a commission filled with political appointees

1211155 we know gilad is alive we know where he is being held and we know who is holding him we hope to bring this to an end soon
1211156 i felt that since we represented defense with our gloves we should do something to honor the best in that area
1211157 and what better way than with a glove a golden glove at that
1211158 she acts like a dog only she doesnt jump on people and doesnt bark
1211159 and we dont have a pen in the backyard with a bunch of slop and mud around
1211160 you dont want the little p s by the way they allow potbellied pigs
1211161 people were very attracted to the young little ones we had quite a few come in to the shelter when they get older
1211162 we think hes a hero but hes a humble guy he just doesnt want to be known that way
1211163 we have no information now to suggest there were any problems
1211164 we havent even seen the aircraft or examined the wreckage yet
1211165 i would hesitate to go in that direction at all
1211166 our happy days in the sunlight are now at an end my children
1211167 the coyotes have come to the prairie to harm us and destroy our peaceful lives our young are no longer safe and the prairie is now a dangerous place we must retreat to the safety of the world below the ground and find a new way of living there
1211168 we must see to the safety of our young and the survival of the colony so henceforth all assembled here should begin burrowing deeper beneath the ground never again to risk the dangers of the world above
1211169 gray one is there no other way for the colony to survive i do not think i could bear to never see the sky again
1211170 little gopher how do you come by such an impertinent question
1211171 gray one i can only speak for myself a life without ever seeing the sky and feeling the sunshine again is a terrible thing there must be another way for us to be safe and not surrender the life we have all come to enjoy
1211172 if we were to approach the coyotes perhaps we might prevail upon them to leave us in peace
1211173 those are very brave words coming from one so young would you ask another do do something you would be unwilling to do yourself
1211174 gray one i would be willing to approach the coyotes a life underground would be no better than death so if i approach the coyotes at the cost of my life it would be the same thing but
1211175 if i approach the coyotes and an understanding is reached then i believe it would be worth the risk
1211176 please gray one i mean no disrespect please may i have this chance
1211177 if you understand that you risk much in doing so you may do as you feel you must little gopher
1211178 please bird can you tell me where i may find the coyotes
1211179 that is a very foolhardy question gopher why do you ask me such a thing
1211180 there is a thing i must do i must find the coyotes please can you help me
1211181 it is a far distance to travel gopher if you wait for the sky to begin to brighten again go toward the brightness there and travel without stopping by the time the sky is brightest you will find the coyotes
1211182 then you will need more help than my few words i will help you find the coyotes but i will not be able to protect you
1211183 thank you bird you are very kind may we start soon
1211184 i see the brightening gopher if you are ready we shall set out to find the coyotes
1211185 he has just been absolutely outstanding and hes the type of guy that works hard you walk in the video room when hes watching tapes and you can stand there for a half hour and he wont know youre there hes concentrating and trying to get the job done
1211186 its really my pleasure to be able to manage a guy like doc theres not much management to it
1211187 you pretty much put him out there and let him go and pretty much leave him alone
1211188 its nice anytime you can pitch with the lead especially early on it makes a big difference
1211189 you focus on being aggressive the little things dont hurt you as much the key thing is trying to stay aggressive and make them put the ball in play and really use the cushion to your advantage
1211190 i dont know how he gets it to look like that really
1211191 you go up there and its the same speed but it seems like its slower or seems like its a little sharper he knows how to pitch
1211192 you never know in this game sometimes theyre with you sometimes theyre not
1211193 theres a chance he might be able to dh or maybe play sometime soon
1211194 as far as when we still dont know we just dont want to have him to have a setback on it dont want to lose him again its getting close

1211199 the barbecue which is a gauge of the success of an event ran out of beef on the saturday at about three oclock
1211200 theres no question that it had a significant economic impact but again we deal with these things and well bounce back
1211201 its so nice to see everyone and see that theyre doing well its very important
1211202 i was dying now i can do all sorts of things
1211203 is what wopr concluded after playing endless drawn games of tic tac toe against itself in the movie wargames by recognizing the simple
1211204 we have to find a new planet to colonize as the human race will be extinct given what we have done to the environment
1211205 we can t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
1211206 google china can a multinational internet company succeed in china
1211207 job growth matters but only if you could get it where jobs are needed the most we found that jobs had a bigger impact on reducing poverty in smaller metropolitan areas because if you live in a small area you can get to where the jobs are but if you live in columbus or cleveland or new york or atlanta it is going to be harder to get to the jobs
1211208 i am neither geek nor nerd i am not a hacker a phreaker a programmer or any variety of technoid dweeb
1211209 this will bring us to a stage in the process where we will know where we are going for the reactivation of these wells

1211216 it was only cheap if you were a vegetarian willing to eat beans and tofu
1211217 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1211218 novaks survived cancer before and doctors can work wonders these days heres hoping
1211219 byu wont even win the conference let alone go to the bcs the road games against tcu and utah are too much for even a bcs conference team to handle
1211220 i think theyre going to be a spread football team as much as they can
1211221 theyre obviously very smart coaches so theyre going to do a nice job of getting the ball into their best players hands whether that be a quarterback a tight end a wide receiver a running back its michigan theyre going to have good players i expect them to have enough players to do what they want to do on offense but also have the ability to get the ball in their playmakers hands
1211222 last year they were a power i formation and now we think theyll run a spread similar to us
1211223 were kinda going against their offense every day with our offense and last year we faced a couple teams that ran the i formation so well play like we do against our offense and go in and watch film and change it from there
1211224 i didnt see myself playing in a stadium that big ever in my career
1211225 it holds like over 100 000 so its crazy were not worried at all because we have a couple older players that were on the 04 team that have been spreading knowledge about playing in games in those situations dont get me wrong were going to be excited but at the same time were not going to be overwhelmed
1211226 he drives the bus that takes us to lunch and the dorms and stuff
1211227 i actually drive the shuttle bus here at the u and just by chance they rented from the shuttle bus service to drive two a days so i asked my coach if i could do it
1211228 its parked out front and when im done on the field i take people up to lunch if im not driving the bus im usually taking people around in my car anyway at least this way someone else is paying for the gas
1211229 im just lucky im able to do it because i need that money

1211258 the impression that green building has to be modern weird solar ugly

1211454 when everythings orangey goofy like this troubles a joke just an orangey joke
1211455 why cant i ever stop where i want to stay i slide right through the day always throwing hack weight right off no never never ever ever right off no never never ever never
1211456 the proceeds of the sales will be donated to protect natural habitats
1211457 a day to honor our brothers and sisters an uplifting celebration to commemorate and honor individuals who were involved in our development and who have shaped our values and beliefs this includes brothers and sisters who have passed on as well as those who are still among us
1211458 similar to the practices customary on mothers and fathers days
1211459 when we fall in love were just falling in love with ourselves
1211460 hey man im making moves and i am so much stronger than you i am so much stronger i am so much stronger than you
1211461 because its green but i dont know what the hulk would taste like
1211462 flavored like a tropical fruit smoothie made with strawberries pineapple lime and a twist of guarana
1211463 id like a twist of guarana with my tropical smoothie my good man
1211464 if i wake up tomorrow ill paint the city in white and bloody red maybe then can i remember what it was like to what it was like to be with you
1211465 lets make it hard for people to find information about us online
1211466 go theres no time to waste we cant get to another place with this me and you was it all that you thought it would be did i set you free was it all that you thought it would be
1211467 a chance to win one of 100 autographed copies of the cd booklet signed by ron himself

1211469 he knows the sun all is pretty oh so pretty this cant possibly be the place to stay everyone wishes they were somewhere else
1211470 feel the hate in my heart wish them dead in the street
1211471 are neither very fun nor terribly twinkly but he is at least being ironic
1211472 and arguably consistent with studies showing warmer weather may lead to aggressive behavior
1211473 and what will you do when your suntan is fading and the summers gone
1211474 theres no way they would have voted this way without outsider information
1211475 we have direct evidence showing that congressional officials opened the letters of constituents read their email and with the craven complicity of the major telecommunications companies recorded phone calls left by thousands of innocent citizens having dragnetted the contents of those calls they decided to vote down telecom immunity an act explicitly proscribed by expert industry lobbyists and congress own traditions and standards
1211476 whistleblowers within the congressional leadership have indicated to me that a large number of these intercepted calls came from effs own membership
1211477 when i heard about the immunity bill i have to say that i picked up my phone and called washington
1211478 seconds after calling my congressmans number i heard clicking then there was this muffled voice i got the creepiest sensation that i was being listened to a day later my representative voted exactly the way i had said he should right down to the word it was like he was in my head you think that was a coincidence
1211479 our founding fathers did not prohibit the federal use of evidence gathered from the mass surveillance of popular sentiment per se
1211480 although it has been traditionally a power used only under extremely rare conditions such as close elections
1211481 we felt that our organization had outgrown its mission district office space and that it was time to branch out into a new direction
1211482 once our trial lawyers get our hands on that money we will be unstoppable
1211483 our new office heralds an exciting new chapter in the history of this organization
1211484 and i will never have to worry about finding a parking space in the morning
1211485 the only thing worse than losing my admittedly frivolous lawsuit to that bunch of commie loving hippies is having to read fake silly quotes of mine they wrote
1211486 its un american plain and simple and i will complain about it on air until my core constituency has even less respect for me
1211487 michael savages frivolous and baseless lawsuit is a direct attack on first amendment freedoms and on any citizens right to comment on public issues
1211488 his suit is an abuse of the judicial system and a transparent attempt to punish those who challenge his hate filled rhetoric
1211489 there is enough information at that website to allow anyone to know anything
1211490 such access poses a significant threat to the well being and integrity of this administration
1211491 knowledge is power and if the sum of human knowledge falls into the wrong hands we risk a disaster incomprehensibly larger than sept 11 itd be like sept 11 and the dixie chicks combined times a million
1211492 with such concrete evidence as to the true extent of music downloading i think its clear we have an obligation to push forward and properly reprimand the assailants
1211493 70 of individuals noted they use limewire more often than they eat pizza
1211494 thats just not right when i was in school i ate pizza all day everyday pizza is awesome sharing copyrighted material is not awesome
1211495 at least the results of this study seem slightly more accurate than the other studies weve seen
1211496 he was up there talking about packets and tubes and then he gradually began mumbling and leaning into the screen eventually falling and knocking it over
1211497 i really dont see what the big deal is the internet is boring as hell
1211498 undermine the private sectors willingness to cooperate with the intelligence community
1211499 since congress has so far failed to protect telecoms against lawsuits wholesale domestic spying is more difficult than ever spyspace will give our agents the access they need to protect americans in their homes all legally and all without warrants or other restrictions
1211500 i think its neat im not doing anything wrong so i dont have anything to hide and if i can save the government the few seconds it takes to get a warrant im helping my country fight evildoers
1211501 im trying to contain an outbreak here and youre driving the monkey to the airport

1211510 sie k nnen ihr db ebay ticket nicht umtauschen oder erstatten lassen bitte haben sie aufgrund der besonderen konditionen des angebots verst ndnis daf r
1211511 nach meiner berzeugung kann sich die bahn hierauf aber nicht berufen da es sich bei den tickets praktisch um gutscheine handelt die keine konkrete fahrt zum gegenstand haben
1211512 die bahn verweigert das widerrufsrecht hier also zu unrecht wir werden die bahn daher abmahnen
1211513 auch die tatsache dass die karten nach dem 31 10 2008 erstattungslos verfallen sollen halte ich rechtlich f r unzul ssig auch deswegen werden wir die bahn abmahnen
1211514 es gibt unz hlige ebay mitglieder welche bei weit geringeren verst en sofort des feldes verwiesen wurden

1211520 in the next round its different because you can say youve got the uefa cup but that doesnt make it any better if you dont get there
1211521 its like everything else youve just got to win your games and make sure you do enough to get through
1211522 we didnt do enough in the first leg we werent bright enough and weve got to be in the second leg we know what we have to do and i dont think you can approach the game with any great fear
1211523 we can approach it with confidence because if we play well enough we know we can go through
1211524 it gets to you just after the season finishes when you realise youre going to have to face the qualifiers before youre really up and running and thats the worst part of it but it happens and youve just got to get on with it and you have to be ready for it
1211525 our players have had a realisation of what they have had to do in games but as i keep saying to you last seasons part of it doesnt count
1211526 the knowledge that they gained and the confidence they gained from playing last year can have an effect plus if we start to play at the same level as we did last year
1211527 well have to do that to get through this game well have to play at a really good level to get through and thats up to us to ensure we do that
1211528 i dont know whether thats as good as kaunas can play i just know that we can play better than we did in that game and thats what well have to do concentrate on our own performance and thats what well do
1211529 never mind whats happened before it is an awkward place to come and play theyre in their season were not
1211530 ba ba ba ba doo doo doo doo doo i dont know how i know but im gonna find my purpose etc
1211531 and they say people dont randomly burst out into song
1211532 repression is a gift from god and we must honor it as such
1211533 i just came from a place with no cell phones
1211534 this is the most romantic night ive had in a long time
1211535 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1211536 based on the information that we had the packers thought it was appropriate to bring this matter to the leagues attention
1211537 we respect the commissioners investigation of this matter and we now consider it closed
1211538 we provided the league with all information requested so they could be comprehensive in their decision making
1211539 hes a bigger guy who has some strength and anchors pretty well
1211540 they basically told me they would open the spot back up for competition thats why they brought me in
1211541 they watched me play i started in the league the last five years and they thought i could help the team out and potentially start they didnt make me any promises i was given an opportunity to come in and start thats what it is i felt good about what coach mike tomlin said im not afraid of competition thats the way it is every year
1211542 the center has a lot of responsibility on this offensive line
1211543 were responsible for calling out the defense and the defensive personnel the linebackers whos doing what declaring the defense were pretty much responsible for all the blocking calls everybody has their own individual calls but the center sets the tone and decides how we block the play
1211544 i have watched some film with coach zierlein in meetings and we need to get better all the way around
1211545 sean was in his first year last year and they had different breakdowns all over in protection
1211546 the thing people dont realize about the offensive line when there are a lot of sacks they want to blame it on the five guys up front obviously there are times when guys get beat but we have to protect as an offense every single person on offense has a responsibility its the collective group that needs to get it done
1211547 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1211548 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1211549 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1211550 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1211551 he expects to catch every ball and i expect to defend every ball
1211552 when you have those two types of individuals something has to give when its 100 degrees out there and youre tired and youre frustrated sometimes emotions get involved
1211553 im glad practice was short because i still got to get in some cardio and get in shape other than that i felt good i felt out of whack from not being out there but give it a couple days
1211554 i just havent been setting and hitting anyone or putting a lot of pressure on it as far as the pain it feels ok
1211555 thats not my thing i play ball thats my thing weight really dont matter to me my thing is being in condition as long as im in shape it dont matter
1211556 i can play heavy its just about getting in shape
1211557 im out there to try and get right and get ready for the season opener on sept 7 thats my main goal to be ready to play ive been in this league a long time preseason thats more for young guys anyway it doesnt really matter
1211558 i can play anytime it dont matter to me i always feel like i can play thats coachs decision
1211559 as long as we have him opening day were fine
1211560 i dont care about camp hes the heart and head man in that defense he plays two or three plays and he comes out on third down anyway im not concerned about casey hell be all right when its time to go
1211561 i like the way roy lewis showed up in the goal line drill he showed up very nice
1211562 a guy in his position showing that capability of being physical is a window of what hes potentially capable of doing
1211563 would you be ok with the post office opening your mail deciding they didnt want to bother delivering it and hiding that fact by sending it back to you stamped address unknown return to sender
1211564 is todays vote really a triumph for the net neutrality crowd
1211565 if network operators cant manage traffic loads one way theyll need to do it another by banning discrimination based on application or content the fcc and net neutrality proponents more broadly are pushing network operators closer and closer to what is increasingly their only viable alternative option usage based pricing
1211566 doesnt directly address the issue of congestion in the network
1211567 and said do you want to be a software development company or do you want to be a medical management company supported by software
1211568 as a matter of fact if you have it on premise youre short changing yourself because youre throwing half of your resources at supporting that server infrastructure
1211569 anyone who thinks that the cloud or even their own data center or infrastructure should provide the reliability has it backward if you want real reliability write more resilient applications
1211570 if youre a large enterprise somebody in your organization is using cloud computing but theyre not telling you
1211571 so theres a good chance that in the next five years youre going to inherit things that were born in the cloud anyway and now youll have to manage them
1211572 this combination extends aegis capabilities across multiple geographies and domains which is one of the key strategies of becoming a global outsourcing leader

1211574 we believe that this combination will deliver superior value to peoplesupports stockholders
1211575 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1211576 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1211577 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1211578 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1211579 we cant let that happen we have to take back what was ours to begin with
1211580 customers are telling us id get up 10 minutes earlier for this

1211703 we dont have plans to call congress into session it wont make a difference if democratic leaders are unwilling to bring up a bill for an up down vote
1211704 minority house republicans achieved a major strategic victory in the political public relations war this past friday with their sit in after pelosi abruptly adjourned and cut off the lights and c span coverage of the rally that followed house members made over 50 speeches to gallery standing ovations after the attempted silence from which grainy cell phone pics made it to fox news and the fact of same made it to msm sunday shows obama flipped on oil drilling on friday we won a great victory that will most likely result in the dems allowing a vote in september the result of which will be a major drop in prices that will bring needed relief to lower income families suffering from the facts on the ground it is essential that this great pr victory not be lost the greatest threat to same does not come from the msm or the dems rather it comes from republicans that would move their goal posts to be whether president bush calls a special session the first since 1948 the goal is a law that removes the congressional moratorium on expanded off shore oil drilling not a special session that would make such a law less likely the dems would not pass such a law under duress and would be less likely to pass same afterward we have then so much on the defensive now that obama has caved lets not grab defeat from the jaws of victory the presidents ending of the executive moratorium is now helping americans with the drop in price from 4 11 to 3 69 in sc now this matters kudlow amp co on msnbc agrees
1211705 i wouldnt jump into a thick carpet of algae but theres no reason not to get into the water when theres an algae bloom
1211706 most dogs are happy wherever their master hangs his hat
1211707 they are often allowed on the beach during the off season but not during the high season
1211708 its not a bad idea to stop every two hours or so to give the dog a chance to stretch his legs
1211709 we also want to attract people with tours of the large modern mines
1211710 but this is the bed that ive made i have to lay in it for the time being and i have to overcome
1211711 after she was attacked my wife made a police report as soon as he realised the police were coming to get him he got angry and set his room on fire
1211712 the estimated losses amount to about 200 000 ringgit 62 500 dollars
1211713 this was the highest rate since december 1991 when the inflation rate was 13 2 per cent
1211714 higher annual inflation rates were registered in all commodity groups
1211715 because our religions are different so it is not convenient
1211716 because now its the olympics so we have some more performers from other minorities
1211717 earlier this year we had them but because of some business they were called back to their home towns
1211718 it is the window of ethnic policy of the government harmony and progress of 56 nationalities in china
1211719 our suppliers have not been able to honour their commitments to us in supplying tickets for the summer olympics despite having received written assurances from these suppliers we are given to understand that they have placed themselves in to bankruptcy despite having been paid in full by our company
1211720 there is not much going on here in winter and spring and sometimes it is a little too quiet
1211721 you know when more than 500 people a day squeeze through the streets it can be a bit much
1211722 most of the people who live here were born in the place or have at least lived here for many years they are not planning on leaving
1211723 such a small town generates a strong feeling of community everyone helps everyone else
1211724 colonial administration nor a body of doctrine sufficiently well developed to enable her moslem policy effectively
1211725 eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
1211726 if only muslims were clever politically they could take over the united states and replace its constitutional government with a caliphate
1211727 on july 21st 2008 when asked about the inclusion of imam siraj wahhaj on the list of 170 unindicted co conspirators former us federal prosecutor andrew mccarthy said on cnns situation room
1211728 a situation where people get very angry or worried about something that is not important
1211729 sure sounds peaceful to me as along as we all eventually become muslims
1211730 i learned that day that i am not good at walking
1211731 what would be the coolest teen choice award to win
1211732 were a little apprehensive since the last one was a hoax
1211733 setelah salat subuh saya sempat melihat pintu ruangan ini sedikit terbuka namun saya tidak kepikiran ada yang aneh karena pintunya memang tidak digembok setelah itu saya kembali masuk rumah dan baru masuk ke sini untuk mengecek keadaan sekitar jam 06 00 wib saat masuk ke sini saya kaget melihat banyak tanaman saya yang dicabut dan hilang setelah itu saya laporkan ke polisi
1211734 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1211735 if some says that theyre all about diversity then look at their spouse if its a person of the same race then its probably just a temporary youth oriented fad
1211736 i wouldnt care if my kid married someone of another race
1211737 why do white people think that blacks want to be around them as if being white adds value to being black in america
1211738 honestly i was shocked by this but thats baseball now im just looking forward to playing for the yankees and maybe i will play against detroit again in the playoffs its time for me to take the trade and go somewhere else right now im going to be there for two months i hope i can stay there well see what happens but at the same time im just going to concentrate every single day there and try to make the yankees make the playoffs again
1211739 gee kim its not difficult at all im not really crying someone is cutting onions
1211740 it will be interesting to see what 10 bats gets us
1211741 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1211742 forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair give me the wisdom to do what is right and just and make me an instrument of your will
1211743 to allow muslim workers to pray twice a day and return to work without leaving the plant
1211744 he is going to have surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to correct the damage he says hell be okay and is looking forward to a full recovery
1211745 if you dont know where you are going any road will get you there
1211746 we are disappointed in this outcome but our complete review and this final decision is in the best interest of our program
1211747 we outlined for josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and unfortunately those expectations have not been met josh needs to learn from this experience we hope he can move forward in a positive manner

1211749 if youre in a conventional offense and huddle up its gonna cost you plays no question
1211750 i think ill have a second or two less from the time you get the play
1211751 it should make for a more standard way to officiate the game
1211752 wow they captured so many great moments in my life and its so wonderful to be able to look back on them and remember
1211753 we spend money to come here with our families its an inexpensive place to stay if they were to say evacuate then yeah we would do it but otherwise no
1211754 this is not the time of year for anyone along the texas coast to be interrupted by these storms
1211755 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1211756 kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless
1211757 loved that dog more than anything in the world he was my partner and my best friend
1211758 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1211759 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1211760 we are sure that this is nothing more than imposing the reform project that was rejected in december
1211761 there are things that can be done without the necessity of reforming the constitution
1211762 restrict or prohibit the import export distribution exchange or sale
1211763 the government believes it can advance toward a centralized state run economic system but thats going to cause more conflict with the business community
1211764 the ecb will likely maintain the refinancing rate at 4 25 percent
1211765 despite increasing downside risks to growth ecb president jean claude trichet will probably renew warnings on the central banks commitment to fight second round effects he should stick to the neutral bias mantra
1211766 clearly a further interest rate hike is a real possibility and the ecb is very likely to keep talking tough on inflation
1211767 nevertheless we believe that 4 25 percent will mark the peak in euro zone interest rates although any cut is extremely unlikely to occur until 2009
1211768 we expect markedly weaker euro zone growth softening labor markets extended tight credit conditions and the strong euro to largely contain and then increasingly dilute underlying inflation pressures over the coming months
1211769 the boe should leave the rate at 5 percent this week
1211770 unchanged interest rates seem by far the most probable outcome
1211771 but it is not inconceivable that interest rates could be either raised or cut
1211772 if in the future lax los angeles airport is unable to keep up with the need for additional gates we would be forced to relocate our a380 services to san francisco
1211773 should that ever be required it would be a major economic loss to los angeles and we would regret it weve made a large investment in our a380s for the benefit and enjoyment of our passengers and we do not intend to lose it on the ground
1211774 we built it in time for the inaugural a380 flight i dont understand why theyre saying that
1211775 i can see why hed be concerned if we were to say you have to park out there on the remote side of the terminal but thats not the case as it stands
1211776 unless qantas have plans to expand that were not aware of theres no reason for that
1211777 all of the experts agree if the first drug doesnt work the execution is going to be excruciating
1211778 i just didnt know what to do i was in terrible shock
1211779 they treated me as guilty they all believed that it was me
1211780 i said i have got records at work that show that i was at work but they didnt do any research
1211781 it was really really bad i didnt know what to do i had given up hope i felt that no one was going to believe me
1211782 i felt that it was really going to be me that they were going to lock up for good
1211783 i had never been to a court before i was just so confused and shocked
1211784 police made me think that it was me that id done all these things so in my mind i had to go through it to think whether i really did rape anyone or not thats how much they put it on me
1211785 i was just thinking about my parents i was going to give them a hug and let them know that their son didnt do this
1211786 if you drive it we can finance it so we can fill it
1211787 kudos to dcu for making us feel even if just once this week that something is getting cheaper now could the government do that for us too
1211788 your money is safe and sound with agriculture we consistently receive the highest rating for safety and soundness by the national credit union administration
1211789 service credit union is strong secure and responsible your money is very safe at service credit union where our members have never lost a dime but have prospered through their wise saving and prudent conservative investments and borrowings service credit union is an insured financial institution through ncua
1211790 strikes are the garment industrys hiv we are very worried about this
1211791 we know that some factories are about to close due to strikes and demonstrations and some factories are considering limiting output
1211792 it is true that hiv aids destroys health but the virus happens to those who dont protect themselves
1211793 the mention in the last statement that downside growth risks appeared to have diminished somewhat now looks like a premature conclusion
1211794 the extension and enhancement of the liquidity facilities suggests the fed remains concerned about financial stability and thus is unlikely to raise rates in the near term
1211795 with oil and commodity prices not growing nearly as rapidly as earlier this year headline inflation rates are set to moderate by the end of the year
1211796 is likely to continue with hawkish rhetoric reiterating their vigilance against inflation but also noting that their expectation that slack in the economy should help mitigate inflationary pressures over several quarters
1211797 we are pretty well positioned for the downside risks we might encounter from here
1211798 i worry a little bit more about the prospects for inflation
1211799 this meeting statement will likely do more to cement the notion of a fed on hold for the long haul as inflation risks stabilize but growth risks fail to abate further
1211800 the players are positive of being able to revenge the defeat of last year
1211801 we need to work hard but we know how to win
1211802 of course we won the final but that was the last game and this is the start i think both teams are balanced
1211803 we played them a couple of weeks ago they are a good team and well organized we have to deal with their counter attacks their set pieces are also quite good
1211804 we are looking forward to playing against norway we respect norways style but the most important thing for us is to play our own game in our style and play as a team because everyone will need to step up to beat norway
1211805 its not rainers fault he played very well at wimbledon
1211806 he did play the semis even if it was after the olympic deadline june 9
1211807 i have been training for two weeks the hard court season is very important for me i cannot call the atp or itf every two days asking about the situation
1211808 i will be happy to play davis cup for germany its not the fault of the german tennis federation but the olympic committee
1211809 it was a big goal for me to play at the olympics and play for the country
1211810 obwohl sich die macher der inoffiziellen seite m he gegeben haben weist bereits der deutsche name peking auf eine f lschung hin
1211811 doctors professors kings and queens the big ol box of new orleans
1211812 more successfully than any previous compilation doctors captures the sprawling eclecticism freewheeling fun and constant interplay of tradition and innovation that is at the heart of crescent city music
1211813 if you do know someone whos unfortunate enough to have never heard these cuts press this monumentally adventurous box and its attendant booklet upon them its never too late to learn
1211814 this four cd box set doesnt miss a crescent city beat for anyone who has enjoyed the new orleans jazz amp heritage festival this is jazz fest in a box 1 2
1211815 excellently compiled wonderfully annotated new orleans fans will know much of this by heart though they may not remember it sounding so good those who dont know what its like to miss new orleans will quickly understand
1211816 a perfect storm when it comes to reissues this box set is musically exciting a complete representation of its subject matter and just plain fun to listen
1211817 one of the best impressions of a citys musical blueprint that youre likely to ever find
1211818 an unacademic uncategorized album that suits the citys time warped party spirit
1211819 we are still heartily of the opinion that decent libation supports as many million lives as it threatens donates pleasure and sparkle to more lives than it shadows inspires more brilliance in the world of art music letters and common ordinary intelligent conversation than it dims
1211820 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american public
1211821 you dont get everything you want a dictatorship would be a lot easier
1211822 if this were a dictatorship it would be a heck of a lot easier just so long as im the dictator
1211823 a dictatorship would be a heck of a lot easier theres no question about it
1211824 i only drink it when its given to me and theres no other choice and even then i might politely decline
1211825 whats the similarity between american beer and making love in a canoe
1211826 maybe thisll break you of your habit of leaving bottles on top of the bar for them to potentially fall and break
1211827 i wish i was in new orleans in the ninth ward
1211828 which some of the cocktail geeks have already figured out
1211829 claret is the liquor for boys port for men but he who aspires to be a hero must drink brandy
1211830 im stunned that youve taken up the gauntlet on behalf of the venerable mystery cocktail my beloved grandmother if only she were still among us would be pink and giggling with delight
1211831 someones guess as to the contents of the then possibly still secret recipe of the sazerac iffy but possible
1211832 you really kind of beat the crap out of yourself during your vacations dont you
1211833 this is one of those rare spirits that absolutely detonates in your mouth
1211834 should we stop at the carousel bar for a vieux carr before we check in
1211835 my brother ive been drinking for 14 hours and odd as it might sound id really like something tall cold and non alcoholic
1211836 its basically a post katrina history of the city it will be rooted in events that everybody knows
1211837 what its not going to be is a happy stroll through david simons record collection it should not be a tourism slide show if we do it right it will be about why new orleans matters
1211838 if it were up to me id shoot it in the fall
1211839 taking bacon out of the package and putting it in a pan
1211840 you people should be playing songs like this every day
1211841 the worst part of this disease is that it is difficult to detect before clinical signs appear and when they do appear the disease has often progressed to the point that even supportive care is not enough to keep the animal alive
1211842 some cats can even serve as carriers of the disease and can pass the virus to other cats without manifesting any signs
1211843 if you plan to bring a new cat into the household then it might be a good idea to test it for exposure to the virus even the test has its limitations however because there is more that one strain of this virus but only one strain causes infection this means that a cat may test positive for a strain of the virus but may not have the disease
1211844 when a cat with fip has died all toys litter boxes and food and water bowls should be replaced before a new cat is brought home
1211845 in most cases it is not the virus that kills these animals but secondary problems and secondary infections brought on by a suppressed immune system the reason these diseases are so serious is that there is no cure for them if you have an animal that is suffering from repeated infections and that seems to have an overall unhealthy appearance it would be a good idea to test for both felv and fiv
1211846 there must be transmission of the virus from one cat directly into the bloodstream of another cat
1211847 the high number of new zealanders being harmed by pharmaceuticals each year shows an urgent need for measures such as electronic prescribing mandatory reporting of adverse events and much more careful medicines management
1211848 thats an extraordinary number of people suffering from an adverse reaction to drugs if 24 000 new zealanders experienced an adverse reaction to dietary supplements it would be considered a national scandal
1211849 we know they are just the tip of the iceberg because reporting of adverse reactions to medicines is voluntary not mandatory
1211850 the 1910 adverse reactions to medicines were reported to the centre for adverse reactions monitoring the figure could be considerably higher as reporting to the centre is voluntary and generally only includes serious reactions from patients
1211851 many of these reactions are preventable and an urgent nationwide strategy is needed to reduce the number of new zealanders harmed in this way
1211852 the fact is that pharmaceutical drugs can cause serious harm if they are wrongly prescribed or if they interact with certain other drugs we need much more careful medicines management in new zealand
1211853 the green party strongly supports a move to electronic prescribing in hospitals as one way of reducing medication error mandatory reporting and publication of all adverse pharmaceutical events would also enable us to assess trends over time and focus on hospitals which have particular problems in order to put reliable and effective systems in place
1211854 we are delighted to be able to confirm mr barry as our new ceo
1211855 his depth of experience across a variety of key health sector management roles through a number of years brings the sort of leadership that has been fundamental to pegasus success through its 16 year history
1211856 dr mccormack signaled his intent to leave pegasus 18 months ago and during that time the board has been through an extensive executive search process to fill the new ceo role we are very pleased that mr barry will have the opportunity to work alongside dr mccormack for some time before his departure
1211857 over the years we have built a skilled and experienced senior management team supported by sound infrastructure at its heart however pegasus health remains a clinically directed and clinically led organisation the reason we exist is to support doctors nurses and practice teams in providing the best care they possibly can to patients and to ensure robust general practice services for the people of christchurch
1211858 while much of my career has been spent in secondary care i am very aware of the pivotal role general practice plays across the health sector general practice teams can make such a difference to the health of not only their own patients but the communities they work in
1211859 i feel both privileged and excited about being a part of general practice at a time of so many opportunities and challenges
1211860 the president will congratulate the thai people on the return to democracy in thailand
1211861 but that isnt new news committee chairs to that all the time
1211862 from the state court administrators perspective there would be no obstruction of justice with how we handled this
1211863 one artist imagines himself the creator of an independent spiritual world and takes on his shoulders the act of creating that world and its population assuming total responsibility for it but he stumbles and breaks down because there is no mortal genius capable of bearing such a load just like man who once declared himself the center of all existence but was incapable of creating a balanced spiritual system and then when failure occurs it is all blamed on the eternal disharmony of the world on the complexity of the shattered contemporary soul or the stupidity of the public another artist realizes that there is a supreme force above him and works away gladly as a small apprentice beneath gods heaven even though his responsibility for everything he writes or draws and for the souls which perceive it is all the more strict but still it was not he who created this world nor is it he who provides it with direction and he has no doubts of its foundations the artist is only given to sense more keenly than others the harmony of the world and all the beauty and savagery of mans contributions to it and to communicate this poignantly to people and even in the midst of failure and down at the lowest depths of existence in poverty prison illness the sensation of a stable harmony will never leave him
1211864 if she would not have had that vision test i would never have known
1211865 im so relieved and going to make sure i do everything they tell me to make sure this works for her for life
1211866 how this lens is going to work in a childs eye we dont know weve never done studies
1211867 its an exciting thing in a patient who has had conventional therapy and failed
1211868 you suddenly realize youre up next and every move we make will be analyzed and spoken about
1211869 for us the end of the games in beijing is the signal that were on the straightaway and the training time is almost over theres no doubt were going to be coming back home with a considerable new level of scrutiny and weight
1211870 see bt purchased ribbit this could be the first move of the carriers to take control from google microsoft apple
1211871 what we expect the competition to do and we think it will much more likely be the apples and googles of the world is to start positioning around a device such as the iphone or an approach to connectivity such as googles ad based web model

1211876 y es que el director general lleg bien jarra lo bueno es que uno de sus lambiscones le trataba de explicar qu era lo que pasaba porque el director general de repente exclamaba pues creo que me parece bien pero no entend a nada de lo que ah se argumentaba acab mareado pero por el aroma del director general el cual se nota est acostumbrado a llevar vida de junior ya sabes las buenas relaciones los colocan en buenos puestos
1211877 wait a minute stop it boy what do ya think youre doin thats no way to treat an expensive musical instrument
1211878 reason to doubt the lawfulness of many abortions authorised by certifying consultants
1211879 remarkably high bearing in mind that under the act the consultants must form the good faith opinion that continuance of the pregnancy would result in serious danger to the mothers health
1211880 this is a chance for me i realize that and im trying to make the most of it
1211881 with antwan down thats one less linebacker in the mix
1211882 but im not dwelling too much on it im taking the same approach ive had ever since ive gotten here and that is to do everything i can to make the team and then take it from there
1211883 playing with my hand in the dirt just like i did in college
1211884 ive been an outside linebacker the last six years so yes im comfortable there
1211885 all through the spring they had me outside too its just a combination of what the coaches want and me being able to use all my talents just put it together
1211886 my last two years in houston i played strong side linebacker in a 4 3 and when we went to an over front i played a position which is just like the weak side inside linebacker here so ive done it
1211887 i wouldnt think it has much to do with peek going down
1211888 i still have to come to work regardless antwan and i played in houston together and we got better down there together as well
1211889 many people including i must admit me took this sentence to mean that a special briefing had taken place alerting the white house to some positive news about life on mars
1211890 why now after all these years what made you do this
1211891 because i hate this i want my life to be less complex less secretive i want to be able to hold someones hand without someone staring i want my parents to finally breathe a sigh of relief i want to kiss in a public place and not feel ashamed i want to be able to tell the world that i am in love and all i want is to be free
1211892 well if there were fewer cows because people stopped eating them
1211893 sexuality is what society will turn its head for more than anything else
1211894 feminists should stop eating meat because here are a bunch of anecdotes about how men treat women like meat and about how pornography looks at women like meat and how meat is thought of vital to masculinity therefore it is imperative to you as a feminist who are disgusted by all pornography all erotic representations of women and masculinity in general to stop eating meat out of principle
1211895 truffaut said it was hard to make an anti war film because war was exciting even if you were against it
1211896 set out in 1963 to deliberately make a war film that would be neither dramatically involving nor formally compelling
1211897 like all copromises this one has its drawbacks it does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution what ive said is i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1211898 while the compromise is a good first step and a good faith effort i believe that we must go even further
1211899 everybody in chicago that i know friends and family were like come on ive got a place for you to stay
1211900 im not smart enough to predict what hes going to do
1211901 all i know is hes happy to be here and i can tell that and hes on a good team with a hard fight and hes going to be one of the ones fighting

1211934 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all

1211997 overall this is a great situation and i love playing for wade phillips
1211998 hes treating me as a human being its all about respecting me as a man and treating me as a man period ill play hard no matter what the situation but when you have a head coach who treats you like that youll go above and beyond
1211999 i didnt make a big deal out of it you just chalk it up for what it is
1212000 honestly of all the head coaches ive had i can definitely say yeah this is by far the most respect ive ever been given
1212001 mooch mariucci i felt showed favoritism toward the quarterback in certain situations in philly it was a battle from the start ive been wearing spandex in practice my whole career and right away he wants me to wear shorts i guess they tried to throw their authority around
1212002 its probably like one of the worst experiences that ive had i didnt show it but it was hard but i dealt with it
1212003 look its not just me youve heard so many comments about how this team is much different under this coach and how weve responded to him im not alone trust me overall this is a great situation
1212004 i personally dont think parcells used him in a way where we could win more ballgames
1212005 you could see that in seattle they had guys off the street playing corner and we didnt even go after them i dont think parcells couldve been any worse for t o in order to get respect youve got to give it wade gives him a lot of respect as he should he hasnt done anything not to deserve it
1212006 oh yeah from when he first got here things are completely different
1212007 he used to get by with his sheer athletic ability but now hes concentrating on running excellent routes and being a complete receiver some of that was because terry glenn was here and he was a playmaker too it was equal opportunity and if he wanted to get more balls he had to step it up
1212008 hes a real positive teammate and hes a real plus from the leadership standpoint of the team hes in the best shape hes been since hes been here and he still has his gear and with the type of player he is someone who doesnt rely on blinding speed or quick cuts to get his edge im not worried about a dropoff
1212009 theyre asking for it they stepped up to go first in this drill and line up against each other and what it does is it lifts everybody else up when people see the way they want to compete they raise their level of competition and pretty soon you get what you had when michael irvin was here
1212010 through a lot of repetitions theyre on the same page theyre so connected its starting to look like troy aikman irvin
1212011 its just that now weve been through so many together and he cares about everyone around here and is totally invested in what were all trying to do
1212012 hes done a tremendous job for us one of the things i learned playing here in the 90s was this when your marquee players are the hardest workers it sets the tone for the entire group as a coach its great when you can say watch 81 run this route and know that everyone else will aspire to that standard
1212013 so am i ive worked very very hard for this we all have

1212208 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
1212209 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
1212210 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
1212211 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
1212212 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
1212213 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
1212214 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
1212215 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe

1212221 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
1212222 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
1212223 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
1212224 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

1212275 the us would not oppose the gradual disbursement of the loans
1212276 while this is not a bullet proof way to stop idb disbursements it certainly will put a few more large rocks in the road
1212277 after several years of investigating the withholding of these loans we now have clear and detailed evidence of egregious intervention by the us government and the idb to stop life saving funds to haiti
1212278 with their transgressions now public they must heed the call for monitoring and transparency we urge them to implement the necessary oversight mechanisms to prevent a reoccurrence of behind the scenes malfeasance and above all to fulfill their obligations to the haitian people

1212283 the travel channels original list of beaches to be aired on their show only featured about three beaches from the caribbean in jamaica the bahamas and anguilla in working closely with them i was able to convince the producer to include other important destinations in the caribbean such as barbados st vincent and the grenadines and st barths
1212284 to have an entire show dedicated to the caribbean would not only promote the islands as a destination but also gives me the unique opportunity to include some new real estate developments and hotels that are associated with maco the show also gives me the opportunity to showcase islands which would not normally be featured on a travel show such as trinidad st vincent amp the grenadines and grenada

1212333 the footings of the levees are being destroyed in the construction process so that the department of homeland security can erect 18 foot concrete walls in their place it is incredibly short sighted that the government would open the levees at the same time that the danger is highest for devastating floods in the middle of hurricane season

1212374 i had put a disclaimer in jodhaa akbar still a controversy happened so i guess i will have to take more care as far as dealing with facts is concerned
1212375 i took harman much before his love story 2050 was released i think he is a good actor and not only that he is also a wonderful dancer and his comic timing is very good besides harman and priyanka look good together it doesnt matter if his film hasnt worked
1212376 i think bollywood has lost touch with literature we need to revive that practice we still have some lovely old classics that have not come to screen yet its just that we need to explore them rather than making remakes or sequels of other films
1212377 when i created my original stories for lagaan and swades i had to do a lot of research for jodhaa akbar i had to research on the facts of history with whats your rashee i have a ready story but the tough part is doing comedy
1212378 i havent done comedy ever it is difficult and the fact that i have based my story out of a book doesnt make it any easier for me in fact it has made it tougher for me
1212379 a film should not be known by the number of awards it gets
1212380 mr podolak has been taking control of his disorder and has been seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist for behaviour therapy
1212381 the idea of the offender being released without serving any prison time is in my opinion far removed from reality
1212382 the defendant should be put away for a while in the hope he may reform and rehabilitate
1212383 our ambition is of course to be a world map were almost halfway there
1212384 i have no dish no cup no blanket no pillow i have received nothing from the government
1212385 i simply wanted to make a colorful bright shoe that would go well with the warm weather i made it blue grey and pink so it can work for both genders plus its something you can wear to miami and stay up for three days and still look fresh
1212386 always be ready to speak your mind and a base man will avoid you
1212387 the travesty of durban ii as a vehicle for getting serious about combating racism is more obvious than ever as a regime whose president is a holocaust denier acquires an important role in shaping the result
1212388 one shudders to imagine the brainstorming among such human rights paragons
1212389 the authority figures surrounding durban ii remind us once again that this forum is an instrument serving those states bent on defeating human rights not protecting them
1212390 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1212391 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1212392 but theres no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person then
1212393 its not like im walking around with a black mark on my head or something
1212394 for those groups who are interested in rehabilitation and reconstruction my government is ready to accept them in accordance with our priorities and the extent of work that needs to be done
1212395 we will consider allowing them if they wish to engage in rehabilitation and reconstruction work
1212396 for those groups who are interested in rehabilitation and reconstruction my government is ready to accept them in accordance with our priorities and the extent of work that needs to be done
1212397 we will consider allowing them if they wish to engage in rehabilitation and reconstruction work
1212398 i dont think we have any doubt that there will be a lot of goodwill coming through but again it will depend on how we carry out this goodwill or administer this goodwill with the cooperation of myanmarese authorities we expect no obstacles
1212399 the top american military officer has warned israel against orchestrating uss liberty part ii to provoke a us led war against iran
1212400 a group of activists including tony blairs sister in law lauren booth plans to break israels blockade of the gaza strip by sailing into the palestinian territory
1212401 the local iranian press quoted deputy prosecutor of tehran hassan hadad saying that the brothers have been accused of trying to overthrow the government
1212402 their families have had no news of them we dont know where theyre being held and they havent been given any access to legal counsel
1212403 irans hiv aids programme has been acclaimed internationally for seriously addressing the aids epidemic
1212404 to fight aids effectively the government has realised that it must engage in global efforts to combat the disease work with civil society and confront taboo issues including sex and drugs the detention without charges of the alaei brothers has a chilling effect on all of those efforts
1212405 we urge the government of the islamic republic of iran to release them immediately so that they can continue their important medical and public work for the betterment of the people of iran and the world
1212406 as crazy as that sounds to say i wish i was still with my wife
1212407 if this is a ploy her being intimate with a 19 year old kid is pretty good acting
1212408 for me to be able to handle my 50 year old wife sleeping in a bed with a 19 year old boyfriend and using my gym and driving my cars and living in my house i guess weve got a pretty good act going on cause thats a lot to take on
1212409 it wasnt an argument it was hey i dont love you i dont want to be with you i dont want to see you anymore it was the real deal
1212410 without a doubt this one is the most formidable opponent ive ever run into
1212411 you talk about dirty tricks brass knuckles steel knuckles cheap shots tripping people up ive never seen anybody in the wrestling business that has more dirty tricks than she does
1212412 this is a simple divorce theres no custody theres just a big pile of junk that weve accumulated we should split it
1212413 but my wife s lawyer has told different magazines theres gonna be a war
1212414 she really wanted to treat guy after a few weeks of going through the mill
1212415 he s thrilled with his present it s comical to think of him in the driver s seat and madge in the sidecar like wallace and gromit
1212416 there is an urgent need to amend the law as in other western countries abortion is allowed even a day before the delivery in special circumstances like when the couple knows that the child may be born with severe disability
1212417 there are special circumstances provided under law when a woman can go in for an abortion like when a doctor says that having a child would prove a risk to the life of the woman cause her grave mental or physical injury or that the child may be born with severe disabilities
1212418 its the need of the hour that we should legalise abortion as otherwise this will invite illegal means which is more dangerous for our society
1212419 their choice as they are the only ones who will have to look after the child after it is born
1212420 it is irrational and unfortunate that a couple who has sought legal help from the judiciary didnt get justice we cannot push a mother to have an abnormal child as it is her responsibility to take care of the child at the end of the day
1212421 if there is a medical opinion with regard to the abortion of the foetus then even the judiciary should rely upon it and give its nod for abortion as then it will not be illegal
1212422 the six people declared sane by deponent dr sathyanathan of the institute of mental health should be immediately handed over to relatives further details should be provided about the mental health of the others within two weeks

1212427 she has such an incredible heart and such a generous spirit
1212428 she does so much out of the glare of the lights to make the world a better place
1212429 the accused deserves no mercy since he took the life of a child who trusted him in her innocence

1212431 we are not trying to cause the economic collapse of the roman catholic church but to illustrate to the court the magnitude of the plot against our order
1212432 delay in confronting global warming and the protection of the great lakes will only make the problems worse and the solutions more costly
1212433 it is imperative that lawmakers act now to stand up for the great lakes a national resource that millions of people depend on for their drinking water jobs and way of life

1212435 employees can be productive no matter where they are starting from a conference room 50 yards from their desks
1212436 when mobile employees are visiting clients theyve got the relevant data at hand
1212437 the benefit is mainly qualitative knowing what the customer issues are
1212438 our research shows that 88 percent of best in class businesses have a defined mobile strategy theyre far more judicious in how they apply mobile technology and do a lot of upfront research on usage

1212440 alex was standing about a metre away from kylie he even got out his video camera to record the show
1212441 kylie had organised for alex to be standing as close to her as possible she made sure he had access to all areas and even allowed him to film her on his video camera
1212442 because kylie and alex are such good friends she spoke to him loads about the tour during the planning stages so it was only right she invited him over to see the finished product

1212445 a slut shares his sexuality the way a philanthropist shares her money because they have a lot to share because it makes them happy to share it because sharing makes the world a better place
1212446 in many cases online and in store sales channels will blur into one becoming fully integrated there is still a need for physical locations but the number of stores required will vary according to sector having an internet presence is now vital and the combination of an in store and online presence with strong links between the two is essential
1212447 the internet is widely perceived as a cheaper and easier way of finding lower prices and bargains in most sectors as the cost of broadband falls consumers become accustomed to internet shopping and retailers continue to enhance their online propositions the channel will find itself well placed to capitalise on the falling consumer confidence and lower levels of disposable income impacting the retail market
1212448 treats are for when the dog has been good not when it has just ripped the hell out of your litter
1212449 put it this way at 3000 00 a pop we do not have a box full but we do keep a couple why
1212450 why dont you get sandy to wear one so we can photograph her
1212451 it would make a great main picture for the homepage
1212452 where is sandy i would like to say goodbye to my model
1212453 i did make it clear to the team that i wouldnt be coming back this season after the olympics
1212454 i want them to be able to get a team together and didnt want to leave any doors open
1212455 i wanted to make sure they had their opportunity to get a full strength team and not wait for anyone
1212456 its disappointing but it gave me the opportunity to prepare for this major event
1212457 it just means the same thing its meant the last two months well go with what we have we just got to keep playing and fighting were good enough if we get rolling as weve beaten the good teams weve just been too average this league is very good and were just not playing at a good level
1212458 we are sure that this is nothing more than imposing the reform project that was rejected in december
1212459 there are things that can be done without the necessity of reforming the constitution
1212460 restrict or prohibit the import export distribution exchange or sale
1212461 the government believes it can advance toward a centralized state run economic system but thats going to cause more conflict with the business community
1212462 the governor has been pushing republicans and democrats to come to a compromise
1212463 it is very difficult for the economy to recover with the heavy hand of the government treasury in its pocket
1212464 this is mr salesman the guy who could sell anything
1212465 if hes going to sell his party on a sales tax and the democrats who view it as regressive he ought to lay it out before the people and say this is the way were going to get out of this problem
1212466 hmmm i wonder what they had for dinner on their side of the world
1212467 the allegations are serious ones and the standard of proof required reflects this knowingly providing false or misleading information is a significant test
1212468 firstly what is in question is whether a debtor creditor relationship actually existed if it did then it is not unreasonable to assume that the member knew or ought to have known and should have disclosed a debt and the name of any other person who may have discharged it
1212469 secondly if a debtor creditor relationship did not exist was a gift received and was the name or the donor known or reasonably discernible or was a donation made that covered expenses in an election campaign
1212470 high public interest and the impolications for the reputation of members and the institution of parliament
1212471 a deliberate policy to ensure victims are restored as far as possible to their previous state
1212472 this scheme quite honestly does not seem to have been particularly well thought through
1212473 missing 20 percent the fundamental philosophy of acc was not compromised
1212474 the end result produces a safe sensible and principled outcome
1212475 i started telling people the doughnuts were going and people were actually quite furious
1212476 i just get the feeling that if its not boutique or prissy the council just doesnt want to know and this is a real loss for the city
1212477 its iconic far more than i realised and maybe far more than some of the councillors realise
1212478 if people are around the riff raff dont raise their heads
1212479 these are awesome i dont know what ill do when theyre gone ive been coming here for years
1212480 we employed a retail expert and one of the specific recommendations he had was to eliminate temporary vending stands in the mall part of that was to lift the look and appeal of the area
1212481 in general we are trying to clean up the area from the clutter that had crept in
1212482 caso haja algum crime envolvendo travestis e prostitutas as pessoas flagradas poder o ser arroladas como testemunhas

1212486 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1212487 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1212488 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1212489 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1212490 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
1212491 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
1212492 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1212493 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1212494 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1212495 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1212496 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1212497 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
1212498 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1212499 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1212500 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1212501 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1212502 que lancem seus pr prios candidatos para ver quantos ganham v o desaparecer querem desaparecer ent o que desapare am s s

1212509 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1212510 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1212511 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1212512 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1212513 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1212514 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1212515 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1212516 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1212517 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1212518 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1212519 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1212520 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1212521 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1212522 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1212523 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1212524 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1212525 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1212526 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1212527 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1212528 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1212529 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1212530 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1212531 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
1212532 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1212533 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1212534 people who take on a mountain like k 2 have to be prepared to write themselves off and im not
1212535 you have to be very comfortable with the chance you wont come back but thats part of the allure the risk
1212536 its high hard requires every skill and is more difficult than you can imagine
1212537 the reason ive chosen not to climb it is because i have a family
1212538 or theyre mamas boys and their mamas wont let them climb it
1212539 but ultimately it was an avalanche that killed them an ice fall is impossible to predict this was an absolute tragedy when the ice broke loose and tore out the ropes
1212540 with the right kinds of capital improvements at the stations theres a good chance of spreading those improvements to the rest of the neighborhood
1212541 he went swimming a couple of times then he went to find out how deep it was
1212542 he said he found a rock and he was standing on it and a couple of minutes later he was floating in the water and he said help im drowning
1212543 i knew terry was a very good boy and hell be sorely missed by the whole community
1212544 i grew up around the river the rivers dangerous we got a swimming pool
1212545 if theres not adults the kids shouldnt be in there
1212546 he always had a smile on his face but you could see the glint of the devil in him
1212547 the last conversation he had with his grandmother was going to the festival
1212548 come over here give me a hug i love you see why we want you to listen see why
1212549 your cousins gone it couldve been you it couldve been any of these boys
1212550 he was always a staunch advocate of the underdog he always was a defender of the weak
1212551 i witnessed it growing up in the 60s during the riots id be in the car with my father and siblings and if he saw someone being beaten up he got out and intervened
1212552 another time a man had been beaten at brighton and california avenues he was bloody and my father jumped out put him in the car with us and took him to allegheny general we were just kids we were frightened but we saw him functioning this way and seeing him like that influenced me
1212553 if you fail to give appropriate answers you will not get it
1212554 the entire reason that the fda denied over the counter access to these devices was not to limit access but to make sure patients were being cared for by a dentist who would help minimize the side effects
1212555 it is well known in the medical profession that paper surveys are very limited and often inaccurate in ruling out diseases
1212556 i dont want to tell potential competitors how we do what we do
1212557 we believe we have a set of processes that are based on gathering the necessary information and crosschecking them in a way that is really powerful and clinically valid
1212558 were extremely careful to make sure that the product is not available to anyone in any way unless they answer the questions in exactly the way they need to answer them
1212559 a fallacious argument that argument would prevent you from selling aspirin to someone who has a headache because they might really have a brain tumor
1212560 we are trying to make a health care service more accessible and affordable
1212561 a dentist needs to fit it and follow the patient closely over time
1212562 in my experience the non customized appliances are typically bulky and ill fitting and not adequately adjustable
1212563 has been 80 90 effective based on my experience and that of fellow physicians and dentists
1212564 to have no dentist in the loop allows patients to get into real dental problems that can lead to the loss of teeth or very expensive dentistry in the future
1212565 what we find is that if people have a hard time its either in the fitting process or they find it awkward to have something in their mouth when theyre sleeping
1212566 our product really works for a large part of the population
1212567 boil and bite appliances have been around for at least 20 years and from time to time manufacturers attempt to sidestep proper medical protocol in an effort to maximize sales the consensus of our profession is that the patient is placed at great medical and dental risk when this occurs
1212568 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1212569 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
1212570 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
1212571 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
1212572 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
1212573 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1212574 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1212575 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1212576 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1212577 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1212578 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1212579 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1212580 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1212581 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1212582 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1212583 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1212584 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1212585 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1212586 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1212587 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1212588 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1212589 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

1212592 we have a paid security person who is there for sunday services and some weekday services and we always have him for weddings and funerals
1212593 its a dirty shame that it comes down to that
1212594 unfortunately the way society is today you have to be better safe than sorry
1212595 prior to that incident we had ushers but they werent really looking at the kind of things theyre looking at now
1212596 if anyone sees someone struggling physically or emotionally more people will respond
1212597 if you come to the lords house were going to make you feel very very welcome
1212598 if youve come for some alternative motive for harm were going to hug you till you leave or till we get you to a safe spot
1212599 i think the conversation should happen all across the country whether its a church in the inner city or the far reaches
1212600 when you minister broken people youre going to get everything on a sunday or wednesday or daily basis
1212601 some churches because of their size they need armed security
1212602 you have to be able to protect those in that group that really want to come and hear a word from god
1212603 basically we were a very unsecured building not keeping a close watch on our property not locking up not keeping an eye on who was in and out of our church
1212604 you have to ask yourself has a lack of an incidence at our church been because of steps weve taken to keep our property and people safe or are we just lucky
1212605 it is imperative that bill deweese resign as majority leader
1212606 as the democratic leader he should take responsibility and resign
1212607 i am saddened that josh would take this public shot at me
1212608 technically hes not a part of leadership but he is the symbolic head of the reform movement so his comments carry weight
1212609 will be a terrible distraction for democrats in the fall when we have serious issues to deal with such as health care transportation and the poor economy mr yudichak said
1212610 it would have been more appropriate for josh to request or if he feels that strongly demand for leaders to bring the caucus together on this issue in private
1212611 there remained in place the express order that counsel remain silent
1212612 on april 8 we certainly did not want a mistrial
1212613 he would have had no inkling at all of the change in your position would he
1212614 if this jury was capable of returning a partial verdict wed never know that
1212615 wecht could have been acquitted of one or more counts
1212616 why shouldnt the court have given the opportunity to ask questions and explore that
1212617 he believed he understood what the position of defense counsel was
1212618 i dont know how clearer the jury could be in that statement
1212619 this could be a lot clearer this is not the fault of the jury this is the fault of the judge for not giving the parties the full content of the note
1212620 that jury could have been ready to acquit wecht on every count but one but well never know
1212621 the government and the public have the right to see this case to verdict as well
1212622 dr wechts right is a constitutional right to be free of multiple jeopardy
1212623 the people have the right to one full trial to convict the defendant
1212624 we will simply never know the answer to too many questions simply because of procedure here
1212625 ive always wanted to work for a foundation and try to bring about changes using the tools available to philanthropy

1212629 her is a little bit about what i ve observed about the honduran educations system
1212630 kids day there is a party with food at school parents are expected to pay for the cost of the food
1212631 here in honduras below i will give a few examples of the idiosyncrasies of honduras that i have come across
1212632 has mel zelaya the honduran president done a good ok or bad job governing the country in his first two years in office

1212634 he is having a little bit of surgery this afternoon or tomorrow to help correct the damage
1212635 he says hell be ok and is looking forward to a full recovery
1212636 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1212637 he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1212638 bernie mac is still alive and being treated in a chicago hospital for pneumonia and is expected to make a full recovery
1212639 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1212640 we cant let that happen we have to take back what was ours to begin with
1212641 customers are telling us id get up 10 minutes earlier for this
1212642 if you fail to give appropriate answers you will not get it
1212643 the entire reason that the fda denied over the counter access to these devices was not to limit access but to make sure patients were being cared for by a dentist who would help minimize the side effects
1212644 it is well known in the medical profession that paper surveys are very limited and often inaccurate in ruling out diseases
1212645 i dont want to tell potential competitors how we do what we do
1212646 we believe we have a set of processes that are based on gathering the necessary information and crosschecking them in a way that is really powerful and clinically valid
1212647 were extremely careful to make sure that the product is not available to anyone in any way unless they answer the questions in exactly the way they need to answer them
1212648 a fallacious argument that argument would prevent you from selling aspirin to someone who has a headache because they might really have a brain tumor
1212649 we are trying to make a health care service more accessible and affordable
1212650 a dentist needs to fit it and follow the patient closely over time
1212651 in my experience the non customized appliances are typically bulky and ill fitting and not adequately adjustable
1212652 has been 80 90 effective based on my experience and that of fellow physicians and dentists
1212653 to have no dentist in the loop allows patients to get into real dental problems that can lead to the loss of teeth or very expensive dentistry in the future
1212654 what we find is that if people have a hard time its either in the fitting process or they find it awkward to have something in their mouth when theyre sleeping
1212655 our product really works for a large part of the population
1212656 boil and bite appliances have been around for at least 20 years and from time to time manufacturers attempt to sidestep proper medical protocol in an effort to maximize sales the consensus of our profession is that the patient is placed at great medical and dental risk when this occurs
1212657 owning the building less than a year and already re tenanting it is a very good testament for the region
1212658 but they will all negotiate just ask for it its like buying a car a lot of people think the price is set but its not
1212659 real estate commissions are determined between the sellers and their agents but the best advice i can give home sellers is that it is far more important to focus on an agents performance especially in todays housing market
1212660 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices

1212673 theres no indication that either alcohol or drugs were involved
1212674 he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point
1212675 this is an unacceptable position for the department to take
1212676 the belief that nothing would be done fear of ostracism harassment or ridicule and concern that peers would gossip
1212677 an oversight framework including clear objectives milestones performance measures and criteria for measuring progress
1212678 we will work in the area of sexual assault prevention not just responding to the tragedy of sexual assault but we want to be a model in how we prevent sexual assault

1212681 hey sen obama are the gaps youre referring to the institutional inequalities like racism poverty lack of housing a healthcare system that only serves the wealthy and mass incarceration that continue to fuel the epidemic hope so
1212682 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids

1212693 we strongly support reducing mercury emissions from the merrimack coal plant in bow
1212694 but we think that this raises the question of whether this investment now estimated at nearly half a billion dollars that will be included in future energy rates should be reviewed to determine if it is the most cost effective approach
1212695 the question is at what point does merrimack station reach the uneconomical point and whether the legislature having weighed in in favor of that makes a difference
1212696 so you can see this merrimack station is one of the most significant investments weve made
1212697 that one plant provides about 35 percent of our customers needs so its a critical baseload plant within the psnh regulated generation portfolio

1212701 is that for women they should become more jealous if there is some sign that their partner is becoming emotionally involved with another woman
1212702 this other woman gets an opportunity to display her caring skills and her caretaking skills
1212703 and there is maybe some danger that her husband will develop an emotional attachment to that other woman
1212704 there for a reason you have to watch out for being hypersensitive which can stop being functional and start to become a self fulfilling prophecy

1212711 her own exhortation to her supporters plus the sense of urgency about doing everything we can to help barack obama become the next president of the united states has motivated an awful lot of us
1212712 we all wanted to make a dramatic statement that were with him every step of the way
1212713 what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1212714 if you are like me you are hungry for a change in direction
1212715 im proud to join in the celebration and the fund raising
1212716 i think the campaign is strong and doing well its going to be a long slog between now and election day and there are by no means any foregone conclusions and i think thats important for supporters of senator obama to acknowledge and important for the campaign to remember theres a lot of work still to be done to persuade the american people that the change in course that the democratic party is offering through senator obama is timely and right i think it is and i feel strongly about it and i think that case is there to be made but im taking nothing for granted
1212717 hes even dangerous i think for the direction of this country
1212718 im a firm believer if we dont protect each others rights there may come a time when our rights will need to be protected and there may not be anyone to protect them
1212719 if we dont have equity and justice for everyone we dont have it for anyone
1212720 im hopeful that our new president will take some of these issues more seriously once hes in office

1212725 bible prophecies serve a double purpose to impress on our minds the existence of a god who is in control of all events and to warn us of future crises
1212726 many of the bible predictions have already come true to the very date foretold and world history confirms this this compels us to take yet to be fulfilled prophecies seriously
1212727 it is only logical to assume that god would not warn us of the mark of the beast without providing sufficient evidence whereby we can identify what it is and which powers will be responsible for implementing the mark of the beast on the world and more importantly how to avoid receiving it our when our eternal destiny is at stake

1212733 about 60 of everything that is selling is foreclosed properties
1212734 a feeding frenzy of buyers is coming in and picking up property at the 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar that owners had paid for it
1212735 were not looking for things to rally vastly until the end of 2009

1212801 this fear of freedom is also to be found in the oppressors though obviously in a different form the oppressed are afraid to embrace freedom the oppressors are afraid of losing the freedom to oppress
1212802 conditioned by the experience of oppressing others any situation other than their former seems to them like oppression formerly they could eat dress wear shoes be educated travel and hear beethoven while millions did not eat had no clothes or shoes neither studied nor traveled much less listened to beethoven any restriction on this way of life in the name of the rights of the community appears to the former oppressors as a profound violation of their individual rights
1212803 any attempt to soften the power of the oppressor in deference to the weakness of the oppressed almost always manifests itself in the form of false generosity indeed the attempt never goes beyond this
1212804 true generosity consists precisely in fighting to destroy the causes which nourish false charity
1212805 discovering himself to be an oppressor may cause considerable anguish but it does not necessarily lead to solidarity with the oppressed

1212815 here is the node you who hate change and fear revolution
1212816 undoubtedly voices will be raised to appeal to peoples selfishness but those of us who consider ourselves revolutionaries will never cease to struggle against individualistic tendencies and will always appeal to the generosity and solidarity of our people
1212817 i am not going to say the names of any political prisoner unless i am willing to free them i am not going to say i am a revolutionary unless i am willing to die for it

1212822 the jews who participated in the warsaw ghetto uprising including those who went on what they thought were suicide missions had a higher survival rate than those who went along peacefully never forget that
1212823 one of the smartest things the nazis did to the jews was coopt rationality coopt hope would you rather get an id card or resist and possibly get killed

1213135 cnn is a network that reports the news in an objective and balanced fashion
1213136 on this occasion jack was offering his strongly held opinion of the chinese government not the chinese people a point he subsequently clarified on the situation room on april 14

1213146 era necesario pensar en dedicarse a otra cosa en la uva siempre hab a trabajado a full estaba presente desde la poda y la producci n hasta el packing la exportaci n y la coordinaci n de los buques pero con dos hijos chicos no pod a seguir a ese ritmo
1213147 en europa estaba habiendo todo un vuelco hacia el consumo de hierbas frescas les gustaba esto de ver crecer la planta entonces pens los chilenos se mueven por lo que pasa afuera este negocio tiene un sentido
1213148 la persona que ten a algo similar tambi n vend a plantas pero en un formato muy simple sin mucho cuidado sin explicarle a la gente qu aplicaciones podr a darles adem s las entregaba en tama o beb si les sacabas dos hojas a la planta para hacerte una ag ita la dejabas pelada y si la plantabas era tan chiquitita que hab a hartas probabilidades de que se muriera yo quer a era ofrecer una planta que se viera gordita voluminosa vital bien envasada que la gente pudiera saber para qu serv a y tambi n mantener en su ventana
1213149 una mi fuerte motivaci n por ser una mam presente quer a a mis hijos pegados a mi lado saber lo que hab an almorzado no quer a dejarlos en pijama en la ma ana y volver en la noche y verlos ya acostados la otra raz n fue escuchar las quejas de mis amigas al momento de cocinar no encontraban hierbas frescas en los supermercados como la ciboulette o algo tan simple como menta para hacer una salsa a veces quer an tomar una infusi n que no fuera envasada en ese tiempo hubo varios cuestionamientos a la calidad de las bolsitas de hierbas pero no ten an otra alternativa
1213150 empezamos con 15 millones de pesos para equiparlo comprar maceteros y envases gastamos 10 millones en hacer un pozo porque quer amos regar las plantas con agua limpia contando todos los gastos bordeamos los 60 millones por supuesto no ramos sujetos de cr dito a n
1213151 al principio pensamos que conseguirlas era como ir a comprar semillas de trigo pero en el mercado con suerte encontramos seis o siete tipos de hierbas el negocio estaba en pa ales y quienes vend an hierbas secas se las compraban a microproductores que no ten an semillas para abastecernos como por esos d as estaba de cumplea os afuera de la parcela puse una pizarra que dec a en dos semanas m s cumplo 27 a os y quiero que cada uno me traiga una planta no quiero chocolates as podr a conseguir de las hierbas que crec an en los patios de mis vecinos y como no ten a plata para contratar trabajadores dos se oras que trabajaban en la uva se vinieron conmigo ellas me ayudaban a conseguir m s hierbas de entre la maleza que en este sector se dan por montones tambi n me daban el dato de se oras que ten an en su casa no s toronjil paico y ah part amos con una caja y una pala y lo sac bamos despu s ten a que meterme en libros de bot nica para ver a qu especie correspond an c mo se reproduc an fue un trabajo muy engorroso todas estas plantitas las fuimos plantando y esperando a que dieran semillas o matitas y de esas semillas y matitas fuimos preparando nuestros productos para cada planta que me llegaba fuimos desarrollando una ficha de informaci n que incluyera su origen y sus usos culinarios arom ticos m sticos y medicinales tambi n generamos una p gina web www mijardinsecreto cl el mismo nombre que tendr a nuestra marca mi jard n secreto
1213152 sal llorando de esa reuni n porque la ni a que nos recibi destruy nuestro producto me dijo que no se iba a vender que los chilenos est n acostumbrados a cocinar con ali o completo y a tomar hierbas envasadas y punto nadie te va a comprar esto nos han tra do tu producto mil veces y no se vende nos dijo y nos sugiri que nos dedic ramos a producir otras cosas yo dije esto no puede ser llev bamos casi un a o en el negocio ten amos una inversi n pero seguimos trabajando como hac amos yoga fuimos a ofrecer nuestro trabajo a las tiendas de terapias alternativas ah los clientes nos preguntaban si ten amos por ejemplo malvarrosa para limpiar los ambientes o lavanda gracias a esas peticiones comenzamos a aumentar nuestra variedad a salirnos de lo que era la hierba t pica las plantitas requieren de una vigilancia cuidadosa y era muy complicado que sobrevivieran bien en el stand de una tienda confinadas a medio kilo de tierra en un macetero expuestas a las luces nos dimos cuenta de que ten amos que ofrecer un buen servicio posventa cuidarlas mientras estuvieran en venta ponerles una mallita yo iba todos los d as a las tiendas a regarlas a ver c mo se manten an y pronto empezaron a venderse
1213153 cuando vimos que nos fue bien nos atrevimos a ir a otra cadena de supermercados en julio de 2005 ten amos muy clara la idea no quer amos ir a la secci n jardiner a sino que estar con nuestro estante en la secci n de vegetales que visita el 90 de las personas que van a comprar aqu s nos aceptaron la idea partimos en tres locales entregando nosotros mismos con la misma rutina de ir a regar las plantas de a poco nos fueron pidiendo m s y m s y necesitamos contratar un flete para entregar todos los pedidos ya no pod amos ir a regar nosotros mismos as es que ten amos buenos amigos que nos ayudaban en los locales de supermercado que les quedaban cerca de la casa nuestros buenos resultados hicieron que seis meses despu s nos llamaran para proveer a una cadena de tiendas para el hogar empezamos a trabajar con locales en santiago pero al poco tiempo de ambas marcas comenzaron a encargarnos pedidos para regiones as en marzo de este a o llegamos a producir para valpara so vi a del mar talca linares concepci n y los ngeles ya no era llegar y producir unas cuantas plantitas ten amos una responsabilidad y hab a que estar en buen pie para cumplirla cada d a nos iban pidiendo m s y m s hoy tenemos m s de 80 mil plantas para abastecer a nuestros distribuidores
1213154 hice caso al consejo que me dio una amiga llora una semana y empieza de nuevo otra cosa que me cost afrontar fue el tema de las devoluciones las plantas que se mueren antes de venderse no las costea el supermercado sino nosotros porque aun cuando tenemos un se or que pasa tres veces a la semana revis ndolas hay algunas que se pierden claro que hoy puedo decir con orgullo que tengo una merma de menos de un 5 cuando empezamos era de un 30 una vez estaba en un supermercado regando y una se ora se acerc y dijo qu fea la planta c mo no les da verg enza vender esto yo me hice la tonta y segu regando qu iba a hacer discutir con la se ora no agachar el mo o y trabajar para que no siguieran diciendo eso
1213155 cuando mi marido dej de trabajar casi me dio un infarto por qu si este es mi proyecto le pregunt y l me dijo que me ve a sobrepasada en el trabajo m s los dos ni os clemente ten a dos a os y julieta estaba casi reci n nacida cristi n se convirti en mi principal puntal de apoyo l es quien me ayuda a gestionar los productos con nuestros clientes y ahora est encargado de coordinar todos los despachos a regiones adem s ha sido junto a mi madre mi puntal en todo este proceso este a o casi qued inv lida se me revent un disco de la columna y perd sensibilidad y movimiento en la pierna derecha me tuvieron que operar dos veces estuve un mes sin poder caminar y en todo ese tiempo fue cristi n quien tom las riendas del negocio deshicimos nuestro departamento en santiago y nos vinimos a vivir aqu a la parcela
1213156 hubo mucha gente que no entendi el proyecto que dec a que no iba a resultar porque en chile no hab a cultura para esto muchas veces hubo que trabajar de sol a sol armando envases imprimiendo etiquetas sin nuestra gente no habr amos podido salir adelante mi hijo clemente me dice estamos todos pechugones mam seguro que no entiende qu significa pero se lo ha escuchado decir a mis trabajadores

1213222 many many firms are na ve when they enter into the chinese market and dont even think about the fact that wages are increasing there
1213223 muchas pymes cometen el error de no considerar el packaging de sus productos como un diferenciador que potencia el valor percibido por el cliente
1213224 en varias oportunidades se copian envases del exterior y no se tiene en cuenta que esos mismos envases fueron desarrollados para otras culturas distintas de la nuestra donde el uso de los colores y las formas no tiene el mismo significado que para nosotros por eso es muy importante como primer paso identificar el mercado al cual estar dirigido el producto y luego dise ar el propio envase
1213225 algunas pymes ignoran las exigencias y normativas b sicas internacionales que rigen el comercio exterior entonces no realizar un trabajo met dico basado en un estudio de mercado que tenga como protagonista fundamental al consumidor sus costumbres tnicas y culturales la estructura familiar el h bito de compra y de consumo as como sus reacciones frente a determinados colores y formas estas caracter sticas no deben desconocerse
1213226 sucede que el posicionamiento de las empresas dej de medirse por la cuota de mercado ganado ahora compiten por una mayor participaci n en los clientes que exigen ser reconocidos en su individualidad y est n dispuestos a pagar m s por una oferta personalizada adaptada a sus necesidades y preferencias
1213227 el packaging es una excelente herramienta de diferenciaci n y personalizaci n de la oferta de una firma muchas pymes acuerdan alianzas estrat gicas por ejemplo con empresas fabricantes de envases con alto componente de dise o innovaci n y calidad lo que les permite lanzar ofertas personalizadas con alto valor percibido por el cliente sin que ello les genere mayores costos
1213228 teniendo en cuenta que para probar el producto primero hay que elegirlo el trabajo de packaging es fundamental para quienes deseen exportar productos diferenciados que vayan a parar a las g ndolas
1213229 es esencial analizar todas las variables antes de realizar env os y una inversi n asociada detectar las distintas connotaciones negativas que el producto podr a estar representando teniendo en cuenta las diferencias ling sticas culturales y hasta geogr ficas que puedan repercutir en la elecci n del producto uno de los secretos es hacer una investigaci n de los productos similares en el mercado de destino para ello internet es una buena y econ mica herramienta
1213230 esto se puede solucionar mediante un previo y peque o an lisis del mercado que incluya internet medios de comunicaci n informes de asociaciones y fundaciones vinculadas al sector exportador adem s el importador tambi n puede brindar informaci n muy valiosa sobre los requerimientos legales y comunicativos para evitar muchos contratiempos y as no desperdiciar esta primera impresi n en un nuevo marcado
1213231 los dos elementos claves en los que se debe centrar una pyme al desarrollar la identidad visual de sus packs son por un lado una clara presencia de marca que colabore con el destaque en la exhibici n y por otra parte resaltar el atributo principal del producto que idealmente sea aquel que lo diferencia de la competencia
1213232 si nuestro producto es el que m s vida til tiene en el mercado si nuestros procesos permiten que otorguemos la mayor garant a de calidad o si trabajamos con las mejores materias primas debemos hac rselo saber al consumidor clara concisa y visiblemente en el envase
1213233 la est tica es un elemento fundamental a la hora de destacarnos y generar la mayor percepci n de valor posible para esto debemos tener en cuenta la m xima posibilidad del proceso productivo de modo de absorber los mejores materiales de empaque que est n a nuestra disposici n
1213234 por definici n estas marcas masivas deben homogeneizar sus propuestas de producto y comunicaci n para alcanzar la mayor cantidad de consumidores en este escenario las peque as firmas encuentran espacios para la creaci n de productos innovadores y muy segmentados
1213235 en otras categor as los sistemas de envasado a mano permiten presentaciones con mayor artesanalidad y cuidado adem s por ejemplo de poder utilizar materiales m s nobles como papeles reciclados que son inviables en las producciones masivas
1213236 al no contar con medios de comunicaci n masiva el packaging adquiere una gran relevancia siendo ste mismo el portador de toda la comunicaci n del producto para lo cual hay que ser muy claro en el modo en que se organiza la informaci n en los pa os principales de los envases impacto claridad y seducci n son los valores principales de un packaging
1213237 los productos compiten en las g ndolas de un supermercado no s lo con calidad y precio sino tambi n con un dise o de presentaci n que los identifica y que utiliza el color como principal est mulo el color produce en el cliente un r pido efecto de atracci n y logra que en unos pocos segundos la mano se alce y tome un envase con un nico destino final el changuito

1213326 evidence consistently shows that school based education about sex relationships and hiv works
1213327 when adults are silent on the issue of hiv aids the consequences for children are often fatal
1213328 youth friendly prevention and information services are absolutely crucial and need to be part of all our education systems
1213329 better education programmes will empower young people especially girls to protect themselves and prevent the spread of the virus
1213330 unfortunately these groups are not adequately reached by hiv prevention treatment and care services
1213331 the aids conference represents a unique opportunity to examine our challenges but also to highlight the progress in the response the hiv epidemic in latin america and the caribbean
1213332 we encourage governments and civil society from latin america and the caribbean to share with the rest of the world the advances the region has made particularly the scaling up of treatment

1213341 but he might toss you in jail for a little while
1213342 i have never been anywhere near to a situation like this before
1213343 it pisses me off he said using the exact words hed used the first time he had said it
1213344 you wouldnt do anything to yourself without saying goodbye would you
1213345 arent they also supposed to check out evidence that might be beneficial to me too
1213346 and he was yelling and screaming at me it was the most unprofessional thing id ever heard
1213347 the mere diagnosis of a mental or physical disorder shall not be sufficient in and of itself to support a determination that a person is of unsound mind or lacks the capacity to do certain acts
1213348 but mental retardation and mental incompetence arent at all the same thing
1213349 an individual is defined as mentally incompetent if he is manifestly psychotic or otherwise of unsound mind either consistently or sporadically by reason of mental defect among which are retardation schizophrenia or other acute hallucinatory and delusory defects of mind certain types of epilepsy and other seizure disorders which render the individual coordinated and mobile but of unsound mind bipolar disorder which results in sporadic psychosis but not simply mild or moderate bipolar disorder and other disorders which consistently or sporadically render the individual starkly incapable of maintaining an awareness of and responsibility for his actions
1213350 the pages of history shine on instances of the jurys exercise of its prerogative to disregard instructions of the judge for example acquittals under the fugitive slave law
1213351 a person who defends himself has a fool for a client
1213352 a lawyer who defends himself has a fool for a client
1213353 normal then once he is confronted with that attraction he looks the other way
1213354 guy stuff nothing to worry about as long as he doesnt act on that momentary attraction okay now ive said pretty much what i was trying to say i apologize for my long windedness
1213355 what do i think when i see attractive underage women i see lovely blooms flowers on the verge of young womanhood i see them as young people moving through a position on a spectrum i see them as just perhaps past infatuation with horses and not terribly beyond playing with dolls with grown up bodies besieged with torrents and torments of hormones yes but also with sparkling eyes and an endless panorama of dreams i see them living and laughing and learning to love aware certainly of their own new found powers borne of their newly formed breasts for instance and aware no doubt as well of the attentions of the opposite sex whether those be the languid leers of young boys the lustful looks of older ones or the appreciative but diverted glance of still older ones men now like myself oh there are certainly the leering and creepy looks in that litany too but those just spoil the picture i see them as spectacles to behold i am aware of their physically matured bodies of course but i do not desire them like that it is true that i dont want to damage them but more than that is that such a thing strikes me as an unsatisfactory exchange it lacks connection it fails to enrich either party
1213356 the trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment shall be by jury
1213357 you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law you have the right to speak to an attorney and to have an attorney present during any questioning if you cannot afford a lawyer one will be appointed for you at government expense
1213358 well some people would say tat any adult who touches a minor should be locked away for years
1213359 that seems to be all the rage in the mountain states
1213360 i really really hate that guy i think ill add another charge
1213361 i did not realize hence i have a new understanding
1213362 it hasnt got a thing to do with this case
1213363 we might be able to get one who will testify that corissa is capable of forming some kind of intent
1213364 how could we have come this far in this conversation without you knowing that
1213365 because when youre that age you do things youre not supposed to
1213366 what if this had happened or what if it had been that instead
1213367 i am not going to tell you what you want to hear
1213368 she cannot consent there is strict liability on that point
1213369 the prosecutor will claim that just by having opened the door for corissa that you were enticing her
1213370 of course theres no saying whether the judge would throw you in jail
1213371 juries distrust sophistry convoluted or intellectually rationalized positions that defy common sense
1213372 you did not oppose a young and obviously impaired girls enthusiasm to go along with you
1213373 i thought you said that you were on her left
1213374 my god shes got no business being so sexy at so young an age
1213375 usually these things get resolved in a way that everyone can live with
1213376 when they find out someone has a private attorney they pile on the charges
1213377 any of the sexual offenses under title 76 chapter 5 part 4
1213378 yes i see your point about the misdemeanors but no prosecutor would actually use the law that that to parlay two b misdemeanors into 1 st degree felonies
1213379 the adult uses psychological manipulation to instill improper sexual desires that would not otherwise have occurred
1213380 consent on each side of the equation for the applicable constituent laws that is that of either supporting leg
1213381 dont plead guilty to anything that has sex in it
1213382 one thing no judge or jury wants to hear you say is that you used bad judgment
1213383 im not sure the young lady knew where you were going then or why
1213384 its not a great deal but its not a terrible deal either
1213385 and besides ten years from now you will have forgotten this whole thing
1213386 is he even licensed to practice in the state of utah
1213387 im screwed why did this have to have happened in utah
1213388 look our sexual consent laws are actually more lenient than most other state
1213389 so if i needed you this weekend you would be available
1213390 what if i just killed myself maybe some people would rethink the way theyd treated me
1213391 i see you use a dash in your log in name
1213392 so you like biking and hiking and hunting and fishing
1213393 are you going to try to make a baby with me
1213394 now if we could only do that two or three more times
1213395 where were your siblings when all of this was happening
1213396 my god nobody knows about this i am the only person she has told
1213397 excuse me officer but i dont hear out of that ear
1213398 in the state of utah its not okay to take anyone under the age of eighteen anywhere without consent of parent or guardian
1213399 so you and the young lady did talk about sex
1213400 tricks and would be able to get the judge to reduce it
1213401 this could be the greatest thing that ever happened to her
1213402 i dont know you very well and you do not know me but i know you impress me as a smart man as a thoughtful man and perhaps you can help me with my problem
1213403 relax by the time this thing is over ill be able to get it down to a minor charge only peripherally related to a sex charge
1213404 if in the process of committing kidnapping or unlawful detention the actor acts with intent to commit
1213405 traumatic for the girl so what he was doing was aimed to save her from the trauma
1213406 and dont we wish that we could have that back
1213407 that said he has to pay attention to the wishes of the victims family
1213408 i really hate that guy so i think ill add another charge today
1213409 so that we can all know we were talking about the same things
1213410 is there anything else youd like to say before we move on
1213411 i thought he was going to hurt me like leon did
1213412 but eric lind has managed to parlay it into a first degree felony
1213413 and we let him know how we feel about it
1213414 she had to call the aclu down here several times
1213415 sometimes it takes a while to get the new attorney up to speed
1213416 and then 25 minutes later i guess dickie robinson or whoever was in charge that day called 911 and then
1213417 and then five minutes later mark stepped into the picture
1213418 then after well my mother said he didnt sexually abuse me because
1213419 i was on the bottom he was on the top
1213420 i asked him if he wanted to go on a hike
1213421 anything about whether she wanted it the behavior in the car to continue
1213422 we have to make sure he doesnt do this to anybody else
1213423 no i was on top he was on the bottom
1213424 have you ever said that you were on the bottom
1213425 you realized this was a mans hand that was touching your breast
1213426 did you say any thing about i dont want you to touch my butt
1213427 and then he rubbed against you and you could feel his penis
1213428 is there some police interrogation or interview technique that explains why you would tell her you told me he raped you
1213429 you said that he raped me you deny you said that
1213430 ask the question again im not really sure what youre saying
1213431 why would you say that why would you say to a young girl you told me he raped you
1213432 you dont have to raise your voice to me either
1213433 gentlemen you can leave your attitudes at the door ill hold you both in contempt
1213434 did you see that the medical report indicates that there was no trauma
1213435 did you ask corissa how she got a superficial scratch on her stomach
1213436 well did you ask about the mechanics of how it happened
1213437 i think i did but she could not tell me how it happened
1213438 well did anyone ever tell you that part of the problem with going over a story six or seven times is that then we dont know if were getting the true story or the practice story
1213439 as far as after i verbally coached her on lying if she doesnt change her story that she has humbled herself and changed it to the truth
1213440 this isnt like a bunch of people go to a football game or something
1213441 mr lind how do i listen to corissa tell me about what she saw and what she heard and what she did and shes got a good memory and speaks forcefully and then find her to be mentally incompetent at the same time
1213442 may i ask you just for my edification to address your thoughts on the word detain
1213443 detain for me is sufficient if the person is with somebody else for any length of time and the parent doesnt know about it
1213444 unglazed pots that impart an earthy flavor to the chai
1213445 well kind of if you really feel the need to put a label on it all i really need is black nail polish and a couple more piercings dont i
1213446 why should i do the shit bet tells me to do why should i do the stupid yo yo thing and wear all the blingy labels is it against the law not to fit a stereotype
1213447 what the media tells you is not the definition of being black
1213448 take it out a few minutes early or microwave it at 5 second intervals until it starts to liquefy
1213449 at some point i would like to see the battle of pennsylvania at penn state
1213450 i also have no doubt that if you played every year in happy valley the weather would not cooperate every year these games are difficult to put on theyre risky theyre expensive and theyre dependent on things that are not within our control
1213451 players make more money playing better in college than they do in the national football league
1213452 as a player i say more power to ryan you want to see more guys around the league make as much as they possibly can the other side of it is whats ryan done to show that hes earned it or deserves it
1213453 here i am happy to sign a veteran minimum salary contract when ive proven myself and played and things like that if youre a proven veteran i think you deserve more money and you should get paid that way if youre a rookie prove yourself

1213643 someone made a scene that they were handing out the gospel of luke and they realized that these were evangelicals and an adult accused them of doing proselytism and thats illegal so that is why dr petrou was singled out
1213644 some of the legal things like this are being relaxed a little bit
1213645 and yet it still is on the books that it is illegal to proselytize
1213646 even though they were sharing the gospel it wasnt forced and it wasnt coerced in any way it wasnt taking advantage of people who might not understand what it is they were receiving
1213647 in fact what was being given out was a gospel of luke with a letter that explained who they were with the church one of the largest churches evangelical churches in greece and so because of their transparency the judge ruled in dr petrous favor
1213648 when youre part of that church it really is part of who you are part of your identity
1213649 just because of the nature of the church and the power it holds over the people and even the blindness of not truly understanding saving faith it is a difficult soil it is a hard ground to work
1213650 theyre effective because they know best how to reach their people
1213651 dr petrou has been part of the evangelical community for years
1213652 he really is seen as one of the leaders of the evangelical community hes written many books hes been involved with the director of a publishing company hes well known in the community im sure that this case was well publicized within the community of believers there and that most people were very encouraged by the outcome

1213655 we view world changers as a powerful resource for the church to give people a passion to fight oppression
1213656 after so many years of freedom and so many changes that are taking place lately we are inviting evangelical missions leaders together to discuss all those important issues of partnership and to analyze the situation and start planning for the future
1213657 russia is changing ukraine is more open belarus is on the edge of dictatorship again central asian former soviet union countries are turning into more persecuted places compared to other countries in the world so this is the right time
1213658 we would like to gather corporately to come up with a strategic plan for the future for evangelical independent groups for evangelical churches denominations asking how should we continue working together to get better results
1213659 this is a very important time when evangelical leaders can come together and can continue helping the evangelical church and working together shoulder to shoulder helping them to adopt new progressive ways for outreach ministries so they can continue changing their countries their communities and their families for jesus

1213671 somewhere during my treatment somebody asked me if having cancer had made me believe less or more in god i replied that i didnt know but it sure had made me believe more in people
1213672 but i want all of you any time youll spend working on this lecture is lost time because its time away from the kids and from me
1213673 at 5 i suppose that dylan will grow up to have a few memories of me but how much will he really remember and how about logan and chloe they may have no memories at all nothing
1213674 especially chloe and i can tell you this when they are older theyre going to need achingly to know who was my dad this lecture could help to give them an answer to that
1213675 my dad could have spent one last time on my moms birthday with her and me making something personally memorable but instead he decided to make a video on the internet for strangers that i too could watch over and over again

1213679 that you think in this fashion is a function of poor upbringing lack of education lack of experience and general insolence
1213680 frankly could only feel a sense of relief that prof randy pausch died this week before he could be canonized in the secular transhumanist religion as defying death even when he was supposed to die
1213681 affirming life doing lectures writing a book that doesnt keep him alive theres a school of thought that you can laugh your way or talk your way or affirm your way out of cancer and beat it but you cant you die and there are people that think he prolonged his life or made it more important because he left his family on his wifes birthday and left his kids and spent time making a video or writing a book that is a secular hymn to the secular religion and im glad its over because its fake you cant cheat death death comes anyway as religious as any religion
1213682 im simply relieved that he died that he is out of pain that he has gone to a better place and that his secular death defying antics dont have to embarass him or us anymore hes dead we all die and secular religion cannot save you from death what do you achieve by dragging yourself out to dinner let your family prepare you a dinner at home disease is not about proving something all the time
1213683 hes dead we all die and secular religion cannot save you from death
1213684 i dont believe in the religion of secular humanism the religion of making dream lists out of disney and tv aspirations and living them out the religion of making internet infomercials even out of pancreatic cancer sorry but i dont believe
1213685 he actually did think he had the answers which he believed were making lists of
1213686 so few children learn to read these days yourself included that it is a miracle
1213687 i dont see that making a big telephone which is all that the internet is is the miracle you think
1213688 live your dreams as conditioned by disney and mass media
1213689 im going to do what somebody in an internew video tells me to do
1213690 i am not celebrating this mans death im expressing a sense of relief that he died primarily because i think that other people who have cancer will not be misled into thinking that if they try real hard and maintain a positive attitude they wont die
1213691 but one thing that stands out is that randy didnt say
1213692 it is because the internet is a neutral platform that i can put out this podcast and transmit it over the internet without having to go through any corporate media middleman i can say what i want without censorship or without having to pay a special charge
1213693 but the big telephone and cable companies want to change the internet as we know it they say that they want to create high speed lanes on the internet and strike exclusive contractual agreements with internet content providers for access to those high speed lanes everyone who cannot pony up the cash will be relegated to the slow lanes
1213694 perhaps then wed see this idiocy in second life come to an end whereby people think servers are
1213695 voip provider a must pay us or well priotise voip provider bs traffic above them
1213696 but well make packets coming from company x arrive slower just because we can
1213697 uh could you show us your numbers and also compare and contrast to all the other pricing where other companies provide these exact same rich services for less well cat got your tongue
1213698 linden lab has a distributed network of offices with over 200 employees worldwide
1213699 i fail to see any freedom of speech issues here as freedom of speech doesnt also imply an operational full fledged printing production and media consumption entitlement
1213700 o 60 000 is a low salary they earn more than that
1213701 o costs of software as a service isnt only reflecting a salary of a programmer but part of the operational costs of the office equipment server farm etc
1213702 maintenance and programming and updating on a platform that provides streaming 3 d contiguous world imaging from an asset server dynamically updated constantly by user generated content
1213703 i dont need to make any citations to the fact that there are more than 300 when the linden blogs state this google it ask a linden theyll tell you i dont play this game the demand for citation goes back to you as you are talking out of your ass
1213704 theres every reason to go on challenging your patent bullshit
1213705 while youre right about overhead not being included in gareths first cost breakdown i think he was going for a general observation on overpricing rather than a literal attempt to identify the lindens gouging
1213706 gosh i dont hear you complaining about google being the monopolist on search dwarfing all the others now why do you suppose that is
1213707 we ofter super fast connections because we block torrents and games
1213708 finally and this is the most interesting part of our model the number of
1213709 plus user to user transactions in second life grew 12 in q2 and user hours grew by 6 for definitions see earlier blog post land ownership is a critical component of the second life economy and the news is very good on this front second lifes virtual world expanded by 45 in q2 resident owned land now accounts for over 1 5 billion square meters of space in second life our growth in q2 was due to a change in our land product and pricing strategy to make the purchase of land more accessible to first time buyers the strategy worked
1213710 and these figures of yours of course deeply lie about the economy because for ideological reasons you do not include in the
1213711 2 pmlf positive monthly linden flow looks at the flow of linden dollars into a unique users account before linden lab charges are applied to the account
1213712 you dont have an investment in microsoft word because all your documents are in word
1213713 real estate is a sound investment theyre not making any more of it
1213714 its especially evil of the lindens to remove land business from their report on business call purchases

1213725 it is the just the most enormous thing that has happened in traumatic brain injury research
1213726 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1213727 ive finally decided to get professional help its not something that blossomed up overnight im on medication trying to get better
1213728 ive really had a lot on my mind really been contemplating a lot of things
1213729 in the state that im in had he reported i would be at training camp physically but mentally i could have gotten myself hurt or gotten one of my teammates hurt
1213730 after finally deciding to get professional help i felt like maybe talking about my situation could be a blessing to someone else going through the same things
1213731 regardless of whether youre a celebrity or you play for the philadelphia eagles and youre in the limelight you still go through problems
1213732 football is important its a means to an end but my mental health i feel like is a lot more important
1213733 thats a helluva lot of money moneys good moneys a necessity but its not everything i cant put a price tag on my mental state
1213734 it is often used as a screening test for people without symptoms who are worried about their risk the accuracy of the test depends on whom it is used it is most accurate among populations with a high prevalence of coronary disease but in most people without symptoms the prevalence of disease is so low that the accuracy of the test is low too
1213735 maybe three patients in 1 000 with a low risk test will die from heart disease within a year
1213736 among those deemed at high risk more than three patients in 100 would die within a year
1213737 does the patient have coronary artery disease and is he or she likely to die or suffer a coronary event soon
1213738 the longer the patient can keep going on the treadmill the less likely he or she is to die soon of coronary artery disease or of any cause

1213750 the economy starts to tank people get tired of it
1213751 its people saying lets get together and help one another and it works
1213752 were pretty isolated from the ups and downs of the regular economy
1213753 you dont have to chase as many dollars to have a quality of life
1213754 it isnt just cutting back on things its about people not needing so many things and putting more attention into their personal interests and their family and friends being creative being of service
1213755 for me to be able to walk out my door and have everybody in the hall know me thats a really great experience
1213756 and if anything happens to me i know theres somebody next door wholl take care of me
1213757 you go to your room shut the door and dont come out

1213764 saving the planet may be the next big trend in retirement living
1213765 our commitment to green practices fits nicely with our overall objective of delivering high quality retirement living what we save on utility bills for example we can use to improve residents care
1213766 not all seniors know green design when they see it but its important to them
1213767 when i sit down with prospective residents to find out what they would like in their community many ask whether it will be green
1213768 the stayton will be a smart collection of sustainable design features
1213769 it will be a project that others in the senior living field will want to visit and imitate
1213770 a sustainable designed building can literally improve an older persons physical and mental health
1213771 we were able to stay submerged for only as long as our batteries had power
1213772 they grew up in texas and remember the really bad drought years
1213773 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1213774 it doesnt matter if youre joe the milkman or whoever
1213775 you know there was a spring around here somewhere and maybe thats kept us young
1213776 this was home it really was and it was great place to grow up
1213777 in fact for kids who didnt have parents who could take care of them this was the best place in the world to be the people here became my family
1213778 but also to be thoughtful and kind and caring about others thats what we all learned here
1213779 and when i first saw the new ones and how sad they were i didnt think i could do it they would have tears in their eyes after being left off and i cried myself
1213780 it didnt take long at all for them to adjust
1213781 it seemed like one time you saw them and they were upset the next time they were just filled with happiness and belonging
1213782 he was an adorable little redhead when he was in my class
1213783 ill tell you we were better off than a lot of kids who were living at home
1213784 we ate three good meals a day and there was no kind of abuse i dont know what a typical orphanage might have been but this was not a typical orphanage we were a family
1213785 and it became pretty obvious that was the case and the owners came up to me and told me you cant work here anymore
1213786 and we didnt see each other again for 33 months and didnt even talk to each other for 30 months but when i got home she was waiting for me
1213787 we looked at these older guys and we were happy when they showed us a little time or a good word
1213788 they knew i was quiet and shy and didnt think i would make it here
1213789 in those days when you won the championship you had dinner with the governor
1213790 he said watch him and whatever he does you follow him
1213791 said mcmannen who is the president of the barium springs alumni association
1213792 well the first thing the governor did was drop his fork and the next thing you heard was clang clang clang clang all around the table
1213793 i feel like what happened was a blessing in disguise
1213794 this is something i think has brought this team closer together you may think i sound crazy for saying that but i really think this is bigger than me and steve
1213795 i think that was a big step for this team to accomplish the goals we wanted to accomplish
1213796 because i felt like if i didnt forgive him then it would divide the team up and we could pretty much throw this season away
1213797 the more things change the more they stay the same
1213798 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is
1213799 by contrast theres almost no marketing for psychotherapy which has comparable if not better outcomes
1213800 the couch turns out to be an effective 21st century treatment
1213801 rather than disposing of the body it was prepared to be eaten
1213802 one of the arguments is really if you want to punish your enemy killing them is not enough if you can chop them up and eat them and turn them into excrement that is the greatest humiliation you can impose on them
1213803 the amount of evidence is so overwhelming it would be unfair to pretend it didnt happen it is too important to ignore
1213804 it was definitely there its recorded in all sorts of ways in our histories and traditions a lot of place names refer to it
1213805 you will get your english based historians who come out of an english culture who dont understand it and avoid it because they dont understand it
1213806 if you dont understand it youre risking misinterpreting it badly if you try to address it
1213807 if you dont understand the things you are talking about you take one hell of a risk
1213808 very very hard for a pakeha to get it right on these things especially when they dont know how to interrogate it from within the culture and interrogating it from within the culture means interrogating it from within the language
1213809 back in the 70s and 80s there was a tactical response group but of course they were never kitted out to this extreme
1213810 there would have been perhaps an improvised army helmet an old type ballistic vest and a remington 870 pump action shotgun not much else
1213811 far more dangerous place than it was 20 years ago
1213812 what we are wearing is a direct reflection of society today i have seen an escalation in violence towards police and a loss of respect for law enforcement in general
1213813 we get called to public disturbances brawls sieges riots protests and demonstrations but we are fully prepared for any other high risk scenario that could possibly come our way
1213814 if its a situation like a redfern or a macquarie fields riot the last thing youre thinking about is the additional weight its never a consideration youre totally focused
1213815 if they are heading out in the full kit its based upon the risk of the threat confronting us at the time
1213816 we had significant intelligence that there were people intent on causing violence and damage
1213817 this episode resembles in a number of ways the so called headwinds episode of the early 1990s
1213818 a significant disruption in terms of the financial sector as we have had this time associated with a short but not especially mild recession but then the really distinguishing characteristic was that the subsequent recovery from the recession got off to a quite a sluggish start that lasted for a year or two or three depending on how you read the data
1213819 i dont see those historical comparisons as being particularly compelling
1213820 were talking 30 years policymakers around the world have learned a lot since then the disruptions of the 1970s were in part a consequence of policy mistakes unlikely to be repeated
1213821 its widely recognized in central banks around the world that milton friedman was right on this issue
1213822 if you want price stability it takes disciplined monetary policy we recognize that and intend to provide that
1213823 lots of things happen once that doesnt mean that they are good guides to the future
1213824 as long as people are confident that we will provide long run low inflation and price stability some of these short run fluctuations in food and energy while they may be difficult to adjust to will not affect the longer term course of inflation we have to be careful not to squander that credibility that means that at some point were going to have to take action to reverse the interest rate declines that weve engineered beginning last fall
1213825 i understand at least in part why youre anxious i wouldnt try to talk you out of that one talk is cheap and your own experience is going to matter more two its not like we are going to observe immediately a significant acceleration of growth and a significant diminution of inflation
1213826 bob walshs knowledge of the world of blogging helped guide us in getting our companys blog
1213827 not long ago employers tackled bulging health costs one way by shifting more costs onto employees but businesses are turning to health and wellness programs as a way to both reduce healthcare costs and improve employee health a report released last week is giving employers some pointers as to how to create programs that engage workers
1213828 education combined with an activation program is more effective than education alone
1213829 if you guys want im willing to go to washington and talk to arlin spector is that what you want you are lucky im in a good mood today if you catch me in a bad mood maybe ill give him a call trust me you dont want that you dont want to open up that can of worms
1213830 we know that if the country is looking for another pop star barack obama is the guy hes a lot closer to britney spears or paris hilton than john mccain will ever be but were not voting for pop star in chief were voting for commander in chief and mccains experience serving his country
1213831 vamos es un grandioso juego que esta dif cil de ser mejora o al menos eso pensaba pero los chicos de
1213832 they take longer to ripen theyre not dyed they actually turn red or yellow
1213833 i think the red and yellow peppers are more nutritious they have more of anthrocyanins in them that preserve your eyesight etc like blueberries and strawberries and red wine so they are more valuable people know this at some level and suppliers can charge more for them
1213834 it costs more for ripe peppers as it does for vine ripened tomatoes or
1213835 i imagine that green peppers are cheaper because the growers have a longer time to get them to market before they go bad also since any bell pepper that is not ripe can be a green pepper there are more sources of green peppers have you not heard of eggplant ptarmigan
1213836 us gdp is 13 trillion so importing 700 billion of oil represents less than 6 of our national income so going broke fast seems exaggerated akin to saying im going broke fast because i earn 100k and spend 6k on heating and gasoline and will have spent 60k in 10 years
1213837 estados unidos es el mayor mercado mundial de drogas il citas
1213838 la raz n principal por la cual los pa ses andinos se enfrentan a dificultades para doblegar la producci n de drogas particularmente de coca na es la gran demanda que existe en estados unidos
1213839 el verdadero problema de la regi n no es causado por la regi n es causado por lo que ocurre en las calles de nueva york en las calles de todas nuestras grandes ciudades
1213840 a menos que se reduzca la demanda interna de drogas subsistir n los incentivos en m xico y otras naciones del sur para producir lo que nosotros consumimos
1213841 en harlem el barrio negro marginal ubicado cerca de los rascacielos de la famosa 5 avenida de nueva york es moneda corriente ver a los chicos y adolescentes con jeringas con las que se inyectan cualquier clase de droga sobre todo el crack que es mucho m s barato que la coca na
1213842 hemos visto lugares en estados unidos donde realmente hemos perdido el control de la seguridad p blica y lo que estamos intentando hacer es recuperarlo hay lugares donde 10 a 15 personas con armas ak 47 est n cultivando mariguana al aire libre y est n dispuestos a defender esos campos con esas armas
1213843 el problema ha crecido y tememos que el peligro aumente hay una enorme invasi n de narcotraficantes mexicanos creando plantaciones de marihuana en territorio de los estados unidos
1213844 estas organizaciones se han vuelto m s poderosas y son una amenaza grande para m xico y para los estados unidos debido al dinero que los consumidores estadounidenses aportan a estos narcotraficantes
1213845 no tengo los detalles de nuestra producci n de marihuana pero s que somos autosuficientes
1213846 ee uu es el m s grande productor de marihuana en el mundo
1213847 s lo entre diciembre de 1999 y diciembre del 2000 se fumigaron 60 000 hect reas de cultivo de coca en colombia las fotograf as por sat lite encargadas por estados unidos y la onu demostraron que a pesar de ello las zonas de cultivo se incrementaron en 162 000 hect reas pero el glifosato ya hab a cumplido su misi n hab a arrasado la biodiversidad amaz nica liquidado los cultivos agr colas del campesinado y los animales dom sticos de miles de empobrecidos y sencillos campesinos del sur de colombia y noreste de ecuador
1213848 altos miembros del gobierno de el presidente george w bush est n implicados en ese comercio y el sistema financiero est infiltrado por el narcotr fico y desde el punto de vista practico han fracasado estrepitosamente
1213849 no solamente carece de autoridad moral sino que desde el punto de vista pr ctico en la lucha contra el narcotr fico ha fracasado estrepitosamente y hoy en d a utiliza la lucha antinarco como bandera pol tica
1213850 resulta evidente que los flujos sumados de dinero blanqueado y dinero negro cubren buena parte del d ficit de la balanza de pagos norteamericana que alcanza cientos de miles de millones de d lares por a o
1213851 la mayor a de los traficantes que est n en nuestras prisiones fueron condenados en base a menos evidencias de las que nosotros hemos conseguido acumular
1213852 es hora de que george bush empiece a pagar por lo que hizo
1213853 el informe presentado por el eir de 120 p ginas de extensi n es un compendio de documentos oficiales transcripciones de audiencias legislativas fotos organigramas y gr ficos y sostiene que bush facilit la creaci n de una red de tr fico de armas y drogas para apoyar a la contra nicarag ense que en 1984 hab a dejado de recibir oficialmente la ayuda norteamericana
1213854 el eir asegura tambi n que bajo un manto de secreto pilotos privados conocidos como narcotraficantes llevaban armas y pertrechos a los contras en centroam rica y luego regresaban a estados unidos con cargamentos de drogas
1213855 ese peri dico en base a documentos oficiales testimonios judiciales y entrevistas asegur que la cia reclut a narcotraficantes nicarag enses para recaudar fondos para su guerra contra el gobierno socialista de managua seg n el diario las autoridades estadounidenses hac an la vista gorda mientras los nicarag enses le vend an coca na barata a las pandillas negras en los angeles
1213856 tengo las manos atadas porque son operativos de la casa blanca
1213857 distribuir coca na en forma de crack entre los j venes de los ghettos es una forma de guerra qu mica que cost m s vidas y destruy m s familias que una guerra convencional
1213858 cuando se trata de adicci n los ricos van a betty ford cl nica para las estrellas de hollywood y los pobres a la c rcel
1213859 estamos llevando a cabo una guerra contra la droga o es esto una versi n estadunidense de una limpieza tnica
1213860 hubo instancias en que la cia no cort de manera expedita o eficiente sus relaciones con individuos que apoyaban el programa de los contras y que alegadamente estaban involucrados en actividades de narcotr fico y no tomaron medidas para resolver las dudas
1213861 en realidad la cia no es solamente una agencia de espionaje del gobierno de estados unidos es una de las maquinarias de narcotr fico subversi n y terrorismo de estado m s potentes que haya conocido la historia humana
1213862 tan grave como lo anterior es que la cia utiliz la expansi n del consumo de narc ticos dentro de los barrios negros como una manera de implementar una limpieza tnica
1213863 las grandes epidemias de drogadicci n han coincidido con las guerras secretas que la cia ha desarrollado en el tercer mundo
1213864 1978 fue el a o en que se inici la gran operaci n de hacer a iberoam rica una vasta colonia productora de drogas en ese entonces jimmy carter el presidente estadounidense nombrado por la comisi n trilateral sent las bases para que la banca estadounidense se pusiera a la par con los narco bancos m s grandes del orbe o fuese absorbida por ellos

1213869 para 1978 la econom a del narcotr fico era ya la pol tica oficial expresa del fmi
1213870 los pa ses esperan que con obtener el visto bueno del fmi se le abrir n las puertas del cr dito de otros paises y de los bancos privados pero la aprobaci n del fmi requiere que se apliquen con buen xito sus programas si no se tiene xito entonces se seca la corriente de fondos de los bancos y los mercados monetarios esto quiere decir en primer lugar que los ministros de gobierno deben responderse la siguiente pregunta qu exportaciones pudieramos emprender que redit en ganancias inmediatas en efectivo para salvar esta brecha de la balanza de pagos s lo hay una mercancia que satisface este requisito las drogas

1214024 im not saying he went up there and intentionally killed her but he should be held accountable for his mistake
1214025 no one intended to kill anyone here there was a threat and joe responded to it
1214026 joe was justified in what he did and it was not just a random shooting
1214027 i think the difference was we presented the case so everyone could understand it and kept hammering home certain points
1214028 joe would want the community to move on and help stop the gang violence that is going on
1214029 if we couldnt justify it based on joes conduct in this case every officer on a swat raid from this point on would be thinking well look what happened to joe chavalia
1214030 i think the only reason the grand jury returned the indictment in this case and ill be real blunt about this is because they thought they had to respond to what was going on in the community had this case waited two or three months going to the grand jury it might have been different
1214031 come on six babies would have been screaming and carrying on

1214037 we put him on their best defensive player every game and he gave up one sack as a rookie that doesnt happen a lot we expect a lot from him and hes up to it every week
1214038 it was like gosh he makes it look so easy and even if he is off balance hes able to get himself back into position hes just one of those pros who just has it and not everybody has it like he does hes one of those guys who is going to be special for a long time in this league its fun to watch him play
1214039 there wasnt a whole bunch of things last year where it was man i was terrible
1214040 i think i did some things that were ok i think my technique can get better and that has been the thing weve been working on

1214049 youve got to let him play and see if it is rust or if its just time
1214050 hes playing well at second base and moving around like he used to well nobody can move around like he used to but hes still moving around good

1214119 its not going to be majorly different but hopefully the melodies will be nicer the guitar solos will be better the production will be better you just try to improve in every area
1214120 there isnt much to change but yet there is the last three albums have been very much guitar orientated and this one probably will be as well but i want to try to do some extra coloring in with the vocals
1214121 bands always say our new album is faster and heavier and then its never true so were not gonna say that but playing fast just works for us people who say we play too fast are probably right but guess what theres a million other bands that play slow people listen to dragonforce and go to the show because they know that were doing something other bands arent doing

1214137 i speak as an atheist myself but certainly it also gives you opportunities for contemplation and communal getting together and music and all the other things theres somebody i cant remember who it was somebody said that t hey d looked through all the indexes of what brought you happiness and the importance of social interaction music and exercise were all important leading this person to think that folk dancing was a thing that made you happiest quickest
1214138 perhaps the most basic factor that leads to a successful social interaction is whether the social interaction makes the people happy who are engaged in it in the self help introduction i mention 3 core categories of painful thoughts that lead to unhappiness these are low self concept paranoia and pessimism if a social interaction leads someone to feel better about himself feel liked or feel optimistic it is likely to bring happiness to that person and to be a successful social interaction
1214139 pushing yourself to mingle will make you happier than taking the hide in the corner approach
1214140 the weather is great and the fans are amazing even though i got booed a lot here hopefully theyll start cheering now that im an angel the fans are so great that everyone is wearing red and screaming and if youre losing in the eighth or ninth inning the rally monkey comes out
1214141 its the same thing ive seen as a visiting player you see the angels do everything right they pitch they hit they play defense and scioscia really knows how to manage a game
1214142 we have a job to do tonight and every night for the rest of the season but at the same time its my sixth season in baseball and ive never made the playoffs its obviously in the back of my mind that i could play in october
1214143 im not going to come out here and win games single handedly but what i am going to do is play my hardest offensively and defensively and hopefully the addition of me will put us over the hump
1214144 i need it but i dont want to use it
1214145 im hoping after the game that ill have something to say to you on that obviously hes not going to play tonight and i would think if the symptoms continue its looking more and more like he may not play in this series but thats something ill have to tell you hopefully when the game is over
1214146 what it tells you is how tough this guy is
1214147 this guy is something he wants to play and he wants to be out here im not so sure how much better he is from yesterday
1214148 he told me that he wanted to go in there to pinch hit or as a defensive replacement later in the game i told him no because one hes too valuable two youve got to understand the pain tolerance that he has i think we learned that when he sprained his ankle and three ive got to rely on head athletic trainer richie bancells and the training staff
1214149 it would be pointless to sit here and be mad over things i cant control
1214150 he promised me and assured me that hed be a little bit more consistent in visiting the training room so we can get him back but he told me hes ok to play
1214151 if he had to put a grade on it he said that hes 95 percent hes had a lingering achilles tendon problem since 2006 its just something that he has to work through
1214152 it flares up on him and then theres another problem with the arch of his left foot that has been bothering him
1214153 the hard part is how am i going to use them all and keep all these guys playing
1214154 thats the hard part but the good part is you have options we have a lot of good players up here that im going to have to find at bats for
1214155 this time of the year its a very good problem to have
1214156 everybody talks about needing a right handed bat to help us out
1214157 there is your right handed bat if we can get cuddy back swinging good that would be another big right handed bat swinging in the middle of our lineup who has got a track record of doing pretty good he can be a big influence on our ballclub
1214158 weve needed a lot of people be able to step up
1214159 i think that goes to show you why spring training is so important you have to figure out players even though you send them down its about them getting comfortable with you and you getting comfortable with them so then you have confidence when they come up here and they have the confidence that they can help us i know that has played a big part in it this year
1214160 having a little more depth and actually sending down really good players instead of six year free agents that hopefully if we need them can use them we sent down some really good players that could have and should have been on our club and those guys are now the ones that have come back here and done really well

1214167 ive spent over thirty years pioneering wellness programs always trying to grasp why it is such a struggle for people to attain and maintain the well being that is their birthright in the last decade i finally came to appreciate what pearce discovered long ago that the heart and key to wellness lies in how we nurture our young enabling them to thrive rather than merely survive
1214168 rarely does a single book encompass such far reaching vistas and disturbing revelations as the biology of transcendence
1214169 revolutionary significance for anyone seeking clues on how to develop the magnificent but frustrated potential that is ourbirthright

1214187 we believe perhaps the wholesale investors are in a good position to understand the value of the bonds the quality of the assets and the good position the funds in
1214188 the retail investors may be responding to the difficult market conditions and the emotional drivers around how difficult things are now so by leaving it open for them if they do require emergency funds or do need to leave the fund they can still do that
1214189 need to make the point though that if a large number of retail investors more than normal do decide to leave we may be forced to close the a class as well but certainly hope thats not the case

1214213 this is not just about michael vick but anyone who might have made mistakes
1214214 never in my wildest dreams did i foresee a day when marriage an historically child centered relationship would become almost completely adult centered promoting and protecting the freedom of adults to indulge their desires sometimes to the detriment of the well being and eventual development of children
1214215 but the numbers which are staggering indicate that we are at that point
1214216 is being pushed even farther into the margins of society
1214217 families neighborhoods communities and ethnic groups or social classes in which marriage is common have powerful advantages for children over those in which marriage is no longer the normal paradigm for having and raising children
1214218 to ignore the decline of marriage therefore not only puts individual children at risk it also sets in motion a self perpetuating cycle of disadvantage
1214219 marriage is the usual and generally reliable framework for raising children
1214220 communities in which marriage has virtually disappeared as a reasonable and normal precursor to childbearing
1214221 just maybe people will stop crying race and understand right and wrong for a change when the ref fixed games the white people didnt say please understand where he came from or its the culture it was wrong black or white im so sick that african americans cant separate right and wrong blame the white man or use their culture as excuse like having babies and leaving 70 not wanting to do well in school for thats being white not wanting to speak proper english just wanting to be known for being dancers and athletes and for calling women bad names and using such foul language in their common talk were not animals and people know right from wrong
1214222 are african americans ever at fault for anything repression is over debts for slavery is over i cannot believe that people pay you for your racist bs vick did wrong and he has to pay the penalty just like anyone else would and should pay who cares what color he is dont play the race card because he cannot make the correct decisions
1214223 the way to approach it i think is not to ask what would it be like to be black but to seriously consider what it is like to be white thats something white people almost never think about and what it is like to be white is not to say we have to level the playing field but to acknowledge that not only do white people own the playing field but they have so designated this plot of land as a playing field to begin with white people are the playing field the advantage of being white is so extreme so overwhelming so immense that to use the word advantage at all is misleading since it implies a kind of parity that doesnt exist
1214224 i was confounded to hear your apologist take on vick on national public radio aug
1214225 this entire incident has caused me to question my lifelong pursuit to stamp out the latent racism taught to me by parents
1214226 show me a capitalist and ill show you a racist
1214227 if vick was white nothing would be done what happened to wayne gretzky and his wife gambling and betting on hockey games go and get some information about that so when you come to work tomorrow you wouldnt even have a job youre not permitted to talk trash about the white people but you can about mr vick

1214231 why because of all the times they put us away for nothing id never convict another black man never let him go leave it to someone else
1214232 hey howard go back to your white girlfriend and your white neighborhood with your white bosses and all be white together we dont need you black people dont care about this theyre just dogs you care about them because your white bosses tell you to care
1214233 i am a 53 year old black man who grew up during the 60s civil rights era the black panthers and the nation of islam here in oakland calif my friends have called me an uncle tom because i dont have any sympathy for vick this case is not about race its about right or wrong period i never thought that in a million years that i would make this statement
1214234 and all these people want to say hes a victim a victim of what and what about all the black people who believe this is wrong but dont want to get beat down by their own and what about the black people who didnt mess up their lives and need help who speaks for them

1214292 they have created all sorts of lies and fabricated all sorts of imaginary stories on the leadership of the civil rights movement
1214293 it is not a black or white issue but an issue of animal cruelty
1214294 black white hispanic it doesnt matter breaking the law is breaking the law and vick shouldnt get any special treatment because he is a football player people need to stop using race as an excuse
1214295 black and white communities are accustomed to seeing each other doing well the dealership is at least as accustomed to selling to well to do white people as they are well to do black people although the city is so segregated and racism still exists its still a special place

1214298 i kept saying why am i here for a black producers party and they are playing rock and roll music
1214299 and the manager wouldnt change the music thats the lunch counter situation you cant say dont eat here anymore but they can make it very uncomfortable for you
1214300 the one thing that i say is everyone is welcome to their opinion
1214301 but my opinion is this unless a person has a trial he is not guilty of anything that is the fabric of our country
1214302 for a lot of african americans who have in the past either been accused themselves or seen people they admired not be given due process
1214303 they are skeptical about proceedings against well known african americans
1214304 we have to seriously begin to break out of these cycles
1214305 to let the n know the war is over and that the klan is back on the market
1214306 what the germans have done to the jews will be a mere tea party compared with what we are going to do with them
1214307 we come today asking you to shine your spotlight on those who are responsible for the killings of our brothers and sisters
1214308 you got a spotlight that can shine from heaven you have a spotlight the fbi doesnt have we just ask you to shine your spotlight
1214309 dogfighting is despicable it smells of sadism savagery and reflects the hardening of spiritual arteries it is cruel and betrays animals that show humans affection and trust and thus are easily led to a bloody end but that does not justify the violation of human rights in the principle of presumed innocence the mad rush to execute vick has been bloodthirsty itself
1214310 as a white person my history books were dr king was a very nice man there was none of this to the black community terrorism has always been on our soil
1214311 some people would say well that happened in olden days
1214312 we cannot forget the past until we have fully and properly confronted the past
1214313 some people are like hey man why cant we just move on its because we havent dealt with it properly
1214314 and i sit in my stadium in the middle of my bed and play ball or i will come up here and sit in my easy chair and play ball so nobody can criticize michael vick
1214315 you would think that michael vick is the largest criminal this country has ever encountered by the media play
1214316 the way they have portrayed this you would think hes guilty until proven innocent because now its his goal and his responsibility to convince america that hes innocent
1214317 im young but i believe in old school it might mean going to jail to get your point across

1214383 we like wordpress we use wordpress we support wordpress we wouldnt want to hurt the automattic inc guys or their users and customers and that is why we set up wordprexy com because we dont want wordpress to get hurt by our crooked legal system if wordpress gets back online in turkey were out

1214387 a fuller picture about the wordpress ban thus starts to emerge
1214388 wordpress is caught up in a long standing political and cultural battle between two competing muslim groups the ban therefore reveals little about slander or defamation and i am uncertain how effective blog protests will be though it is an intriguing idea to try to force the hands of turkish courts
1214389 which came to power by attacking secularist turks for their anti free speech views
1214390 what does this say about the promises that islamist parties make before actually acquiring power how does this bode for islamist democrats in
1214391 as it is known by public the entry of the publications to turkey of the blog service named woldpress com that gives the opportunity of opening free site to internet users is interrupted with the judgement this judgement is applied on 17 8 2007 and thus the entery of worldpress com service and the publications of all sub sites which takes service from this service to turkey is interrupted
1214392 they seem proud that they blocked all the sites instead of just the ones that they consider illegal under turkish law
1214393 ignoring the judgements that are given by the turkish courts
1214394 never received any notice from turkish courts about anything only barely coherent threats and bully attempts written much like the above
1214395 when they said they contacted us 17 times that means that they would blast the same email to multiple address and when they didnt get the reply they wanted they sent the same message over and over again
1214396 was that we block the name of their client being used by any blog hosted by our site much like you cant write democracy on blogs hosted by msn spaces in china
1214397 there is a lesson which all blog services and internet service providers should take from this judgement blog services especially the ones that give free service should be careful about the sites that are illegally active through their firms these services should not remain insensitive to the complints that they receive and especially to the judgements it is certain that the services which behave opppositely will meet with the same enforcement that wordpress met

1214403 but im very concerned about your resolution h con res 362
1214404 hes very unpopular so he wont win unless we attack them iran is a very ancient sophisticated culture they can take care of themselves we just need to leave them alone
1214405 iran is in compliance with the iaea and both the nie and the iaea have said there is no evidence that iran is developing a nuclear weapon
1214406 you dont need to do that just withdraw your resolution
1214407 if you can show me evidence that iran is allowing the iaea to do its inspection i will withdraw my resolution

1214410 if judgment is given for langston it puts them in a position to call for millions of pounds to be accelerated back to them
1214411 so clearly one has to think that the club is then facing administration and points deduction and everything else that will follow
1214412 the club does not have any cause to believe that this signed document is invalid and consequently it does not consider that it has any debts repayable to langston prior to 2016
1214413 you can clearly see that the argument on the part of langston is there was a clear breach of our agreement at the moment that security was given to someone else
1214414 the argument from cardiff will be no we felt free to do that because of the variation of the agreement and it then becomes a matter of the courts judgment which path was right

1214417 we arent thinking of what we are going to do but what we are not going to do we are never going to limit our turkish bloggers freedom of speech
1214418 for that reason instead of the whole site they couldve blocked the ones relating to that law
1214419 for that reason instead of the whole site they couldve just blocked only the ones relating to that law
1214420 kerim kalkan a lawyer for oktar said that the court first ordered turk telecom to block a couple of specific sites but the authors of the sites soon moved the allegedly libelous content to other wordpress sites

1214425 istanbul is the last stop for old judges before retirement theyre all too old to rock and roll and to learn web technologies theyre also too busy to research for these kind of childish issues that means if someone requests a domain blocking to any istanbul court the judge probably thinks there may be no risk for society or for my carr e er in its last minutes let me block now some other one can fix it anyhow
1214426 one of the few outlets for expression not blocked in turkey
1214427 this law is believed to be sufficient on its own as a substitute for a whole package as it covers a wide range of issues
1214428 they spammed 4 5 email addresses with it just like they used to with their complaints it was already in english i didnt translate it
1214429 the trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of ones time defending scoundrels for it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all

1214435 a student owned independent network dedicated to eliminate extremist ideologies and ignorance from the middle east
1214436 banning wordpress is a clear violation of free speech that effects the citizens of turkey wordpress bloggers and readers all over the world
1214437 certainly these disputes can be handled more judiciously by the turkish turkey blog archive petition launched to unblock wordpress in turkey
1214438 the freedom of the press is for those who own one
1214439 it is worth noting however that under us law wordpress likely could not be held liable for the statements of its users because of section 230 c of the communications decency act which provides that
1214440 if a uk lawyer sent such a letter the first thing you would expect to see is a summary of what the content that is alleged to be defamatory is then you would see an interpretation as to what those defamatory words were alleged to have meant to a typical reasonable reader in their ordinary and natural meaning finally you would see an assertion that the words were untrue and an indication of the evidence that supports that contention it is certainly not illegal here to publish anything defamatory at all if i write that peter sutcliffe is the grossest and most reprehensible serial killer we have ever entertained it is certainly defamatory it is also true it is also fair comment on a matter of public interest so it is not libellous that is a big difference apart from being a nutter i understand the plaintiff to have criminal convictions himself hence he has no reputation worth defending on our recent cases any proceedings here would probably be struck out under our civil procedure rules part 3 as an abuse of process the game is not worth the candle
1214441 there is a lesson which all blog services and internet service providers should take from this judgement blog services especially the ones that give free service should be careful about the sites that are illegally active through their firms these services should not remain insensitive to the complints that they receive and especially to the judgements it is certain that the services which behave opppositely will meet with the same enforcement that wordpress met
1214442 this ban doesnt harm free speech affected turkish bloggers can move to other providers and continue to speak my rephrasing
1214443 depending on the degree of spread of such ideas as akp being in league with the types of adnan oktar they may even effectively silence this character

1214445 were doing exactly what our forefathers did when they came to the new world from the european continent

1214447 were talking about the idea of learning to live there
1214448 just like we use resources here on earth in order to live off the land you can do the same thing on the moon
1214449 a metric ton of helium 3 would supply about one sixth of the energy needs today of the british isles
1214450 if we had gold bricks stacked up on the surface of the moon we couldnt afford to bring them back this material at several billion dollars a tonne is what makes it all worthwhile
1214451 as far as how the universe works were just barely out of the trees until we know what the moon is really all about the idea of trying to commercialise it is in my opinion a misplaced idea
1214452 the moon is such a rich scientific destination i think we need to look at it just the way we do the south pole
1214453 we should go there find everything there is to find out scientifically there are a number of resources that we know can be of great benefit

1214473 has secretly backdated millions of options to its top officers and directors for nearly a decade reporting false financial statements and issuing false proxies to shareholders
1214474 a year later there is still no sign of an end to these problems instead the sense of pressure on western banks has risen so high that by some measures this is now the worst financial crisis seen in the west for 70 years
1214475 fortunately for former senior bear executives like jimmy cayne alan greenberg and alan schwartz j p morgan chase agreed to indemnify bears officers and directors for six years against these lawsuits
1214476 if there is need for a study of the historic continuity of a single culture why cant this be african why cant african literature be at the centre so that we can view other cultures in relationship to it
1214477 mounts a nuanced but caustic political and social satire of african corruption of african society with a touch of magical realism or perhaps realistic magic as the wizards tricks hung on holding a not so enchanted mirror to his clients hidden delusions the result is a sometimes lurid sometimes lyrical reflection on africas dysfunctions and its possibilities
1214478 magic realism drives this mammoth novel set in the imaginary african country of aburiria and exiled kenyan writer wa thiongo roots the wild fantasy in the brutal horror of contemporary politics his ridicule of the powerful knows no bounds as the novel chronicles greed and corruption in aburiria and in the west including the global banks funding of the aburirian rulers marching to heaven tower of babel but even more than the crazy plot of coup countercoup flattery and betrayal what holds the reader here is the intimate story of one couple quiet secretary nyawira secret leader of the peoples resistance movement persuades her intellectual lover kamiti to give up his search for himself in the wild and they embark on a plan to change the world with kamiti disguised as a sorcerer set off by the global farce this unforgettable love story reveals the magic power of the ordinary in people and in politics
1214479 ngugi has perfected in wizard of the crow an art of radical simplicity of sharply defined conflicts that paradoxically is less reductive than ostensibly more nuanced accounts of africa proffered by historians and political analysts at once an epic burlesque of a sick lumbering state and a praise song to the manifold forms of african resistance the phantasmagoric saga of aburiria is as clear a view of africa as we are likely to get for sometime
1214480 i have every expectation that his new novel wizard of the crow will be seen in years to come as the equal of midnights children the tin drum or one hundred years of solitude a magisterial magic realist account of 20th century african history it is unreservedly a masterpiece
1214481 in its best scatological moments it echoes the great latin american novels of dictatorship by miguel angel asturias carlos fuentes and gabriel garcia marquez it now stands as a vivid portrait of postcolonialism and the banality of evil
1214482 ngugi writes with bite on contemporary african themes like corruption and sexual discrimination but he isnt caustic or heavy handed its magical realism meets africa and it hits the mark
1214483 in his crowded career and eventful life ngugi has enacted for all to see the paradigmatic trials and quandaries of a contemporary african writer caught in sometimes implacable political social racial and linguistic currents the tale is fantastic and didactic told in broad strokes its principal actors wear physical distortions like large firelit masks
1214484 the pull and promise of wizard of the crow is evident in the labyrinthine wonders of its opening chapters which involve the authors most raucus and ambitious combination to date of satire social realism and supernatural occurrence
1214485 the effort to throw off the se shadow chains of the colonia past while establishing an authentically african continuum has been at the thematic center of much african literature but in ngugi wa thiongos epic novel
1214486 this delirious comedy feeds on itself at its deepest level the novel is really about re centering the authors discourse in africa itself by a radical focus on multiple african voices there are many tellers of tales in this saga and each has an individual authenticity
1214487 aburiria is recognisable as africa in all its splendour squalor economic malaise and venality but it comes with more than a touch of magical realism despite the books faults it is hard not to be cheered by the spirit of gentle resistance that is at its core in defiance of everyday greed
1214488 wizard of the crow is the most ambitious entry yet from a writer whose output feels essential for those hoping to understand contemporary africa
1214489 the shades of humour range from the caustic when lampooning a corrupt politician to affectionate when exposing the frailty of ordinary struggling to survive it is also a love story that leaves lingering tenderness
1214490 wizard of the crow is an impish and hallucinatory satire on dictatorship as though saddam hussein had won a coup d tat in wonderland then sent alice and the rabbit to a soviet labour camp
1214491 this novel is restless epic allusive ngugi wa thiongo gives himself scope to tackle big themes to explore the nature of political oppression and corruption his book attempts to explode assumptions about the essence of reality it blurs and frequently juxtaposes visions of everyday consciousness and visionary truth this is a book about choosing sides a book above all about the individuals responses to moral dilemmas its a book of wonderful purple phases the greatest lyrical description of making love i have ever read a marvelous evocation of wilderness
1214492 why should a reader invest in wizard of the crow nearly 800 page bulk simply because this novel is a literary masterpiece woven in the rich nuance of africas oral tradition as real as spilt blood a mythical dance of great power

1214581 i melted the statue with a hair dryer until it dissolved into small droplets the size of bbs seriously roomie how in heck do you think i could have done this
1214582 look at those little pieces of stone they represent only half of the statue the rest must have been completely vaporized surely now you must believe me professor there is no way that a human being could do that
1214583 but it wasnt done by magic either theres no such skypath curse and theres no supernatural prophecy that has anything to do with this these happenings are all part of natural history and you know it you just enjoy being a stubborn old goat
1214584 yes you did it was on september 11th when you asked for my help you said you wanted me to translate the skypath scrolls and that professor kraus would help me learn byzantine greek i know thats not true because i heard her talking to you yesterday she said that all of your theories were bunk
1214585 is that all youre right that she doesnt believe me but youre wrong about the rest professor kraus is a skeptic of the best kind she puts no stock in the ancient prophecies whatsoever she wants to disprove them but she cant do that until someone has translated them thats why she agreed to teach you byzantine
1214586 well i guess that makes sense in a grownup sort of way
1214587 youll have to pardon me professor but i dont want to translate them any more every one thinks youre off your rocker and frankly i intend to agree if i go through with this ill lose my friends
1214588 i was going to release you from your promise anyway the scrolls dont matter anymore not since the statue got destroyed
1214589 because the statue of good has been destroyed its a sign that all hope has vanished when i asked you to translate the scrolls i knew i was asking you to do something difficult it would have taken you years even with professional help to accomplish that task i thought we had time but now we dont since the statue has been destroyed we may only have weeks or even days to start studying it now would be ludicrous
1214590 since theres no hope we might as well not try anything i guess this is the last time ill be in this office

1214598 there is reason to doubt the lawfulness of many abortions authorised by the certifying consultants indeed the committee has stated that the law is being used more liberally than parliament intended

1214607 but thats not really what i mean its more than just terrorism its more than just al qaeda there are greater things about to happen here that are not related to the physical causes or technical reasons that these horrible events have occurred the powers of fate often use unrelated incidents in close proximity to bring about ambient changes that portend to major shifts in the time line history is sending us a message that terrible things are about to happen
1214608 i know phillip thats why i need your help if we dont stop it it will get much worse do you remember that story that brian told you the other day he told me that youve heard the legend of the skypath scroll that was discovered on the college campus 100 years ago
1214609 she told me shed be willing to teach you if you were willing to learn she says you have the ability to translate the main body of the document although you will obviously make a few mistakes
1214610 i dont know why are you asking me this anyway wouldnt it be better if a faculty member like dr kraus herself would make the translation
1214611 but unfortunately thats impossible the college has an insurance policy that specifically stipulates that no one on the school payroll can ever attempt something like that without their explicit endorsement apparently theyre worried that another building might burn down or something worse
1214612 brian mentioned something about people dieing or some such he said that everyday the scroll was open something horrible happened i certainly hope its not real
1214613 there are many effective ways to defend against a curse if there really is one for instance you can surround the affected article with charms to irradiate the pathways so that the evil cant escape or else you can try exorcising it sometimes you can defeat the curse through simple technicalities in the language

1214770 as far as im concerned they should not be able to get out on bail
1214771 if his offenses are not on that list and you dont have a prior record then youre entitled to bond
1214772 thats a legislative problem not a judge gold problem all he did was follow the law if he hadnt given him a bond the appeals court would have sent it back to him and said give him a bond
1214773 judges have a fear that if they grant an appellate bond in a relatively notorious case that they will face exactly what judge gold is facing right now
1214774 only the strongest most confident judges are able to follow the law in situations like that

1214797 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine

1214829 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
1214830 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1214831 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk

1214878 estimates of maximum bite force for t rex are around 3 1 tonnes greater than for a living white shark but puny compared to big tooth
1214879 the great white is without a doubt one of the hardest biting creatures alive possibly the hardest
1214880 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
1214881 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales
1214882 resistant to insect infestation such as termites because the feathers are inedible
1214883 they are also not as flammable or combustible as conventional cement and wood fibre composite boards
1214884 conventional waste disposal methods when applied to chicken feathers are problematic
1214885 incineration releases greenhouse gases and the feathers take up a lot of space in landfills and take a long time to decay because of the keratin protein that makes up the feathers
1214886 there is also the fear of bird flu which makes converting chicken feathers into animal feeds undesirable
1214887 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1214888 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1214889 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1214890 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1214891 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests

1214929 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the ocs access case is projected to be 1 6 percent higher than in the reference case and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone at 5 6 million barrels per day because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant

1214946 dispiace particolarmente per il presidente e per questa splendida tifoseria che entrambi si meritavano la b al di l di un buon cittadella c stato qualche episodio non chiaro ed questo che fa male eravamo anche riusciti a fare il secondo gol che ci avrebbe mandato ai supplementari il guardalinee ha sbandierato mi dicono il gol fosse regolare il segnalinee ha avuto grande personalit oltre a ci quando parlo di episodi non chiari intendo il rigore concesso a loro per fallo di mano di argilli il fallo su ferrarese sul terzo gol il rigore non concesso a temelin sono questi gli episodi che fanno pendere la bilancia della gara a favore di qualcuno c grande rammarico sul primo gol abbiamo concesso una ripartenza che non avremmo dovuto concedere anche se ora ogni parola lascia il tempo che trova bisogna essere bravi e fare i complimenti al cittadella ed ora che succede arrivare alla finalissima ad un passo dalla b al primo anno devessere per il presidente motivo di orgoglio ora non facile ripartire ma le ferite si rimarginano col tempo
1214947 secondo me il fuorigioco non cera io sono saltato e ho preso la palla cozzolino ha fatto gol non riesco a pensare ad altri motivi che il fuori gioco per annullare il gol daltronde sono cose che ho visto mille volte come ho visto mille volte dare falli in occasioni come quella che ha portato al terzo gol loro quando ferrarese andato gi non so se fosse fallo su ferrarese ma dura da accettare il calcio per questo ora spero solo che le immagini ci diano torto se non veramente dura da accettare
1214948 e difficile trovare parole da dire credo sia stata una partita strana con episodi strani adesso spero che chi preposto a giudicare si dimostri competente ci sono stati episodi strani non so cosa diranno le immagini televisive ma dal campo la sensazione era precisa con questo faccio i complimenti al cittadella perch non voglio toglierli merito per quello che sono stati bravi a fare
1214949 forse il primo gol preso su un angolo a favore e su una ripartenza quando a noi il pari bastava e una cosa che non ti aspetti da una squadra esperta per il resto non so cosa dire la batosta ancora troppo calda
1214950 nella vita purtroppo nulla mai sicuro peccato perch dopo qualche difficolt negli ultimi tempi stavo venendo fuori e questo sarebbe stato il coronamento ora bisogner saper rialzare la testa
1214951 resto il presidente del pisa sono troppo attaccato ai colori nerazzurri per lasciare questa citt e questi tifosi
1214952 siamo una piccola citt non possiamo fare cose enormi il nostro obiettivo sar quello di lottare per la salvezza dobbiamo continuare ad essere umili poi tutto quello che faremo in pi sar tanto di guadagnato
1214953 per contestualmente la trattativa con silvestrini va avanti anche perch se non mi sbaglio la propriet di due squadre non incompatibile ed consentito possedere due societ calcistiche che non siano nella stessa serie
1214954 sono onorato di allenare in una grande piazza come pagani

1214956 we have a lot to say we should start a blog its time to start a blog
1214957 why put off till tomorrow what you can do day after tomorrow just as well
1214958 it is important to understand the rules and regulations of writing and sentence structure communication has always been the cornerstone of our past even the men and women who lived in the crustacean era tried to communicate with each other even though to us it may have looked like crude drawings and may have sounded like grunts and groans regardless of how primitive they were they must have had their own rules and regulations in order to be understood
1214959 there is more than one way to skin a cat

1214963 both leaders expressed their disappointment that a breakthrough in the negotiations was not reached this week in geneva particularly given how close trade ministers came to reaching an agreement
1214964 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1214965 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1214966 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1214967 id like to thank all of you for your support of our troops and heres why im many things in my life and one thing id like to be is your first lady but more importantly im jack mccains mother and jimmy mccains mother one in the u s navy and another one in the marine corps an iraqi vet
1214968 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1214969 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1214970 that there were no intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1214971 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1214972 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1214973 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1214974 the allegation that the directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1214975 makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1214976 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1214977 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no
1214978 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1214979 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1214980 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1214981 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1214982 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1214983 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1214984 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1214985 tendency of the to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1214986 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1214987 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1214988 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1214989 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1214990 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1214991 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1214992 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1214993 it was different than what i am used to because i am used to smaller meets with local ymcas
1214994 this meet was with ymcas all over i knew it was going to be big but i just didnt know how big it was going to be
1214995 he told me just to have fun stay relaxed and let the hard work take care of itself
1214996 he was very supportive of me and i am going to miss him
1214997 i had convinced myself that i was not going to be able to do it and i just psyched myself out
1214998 after i swam the 200 on wednesday i had thursday off before i performed again on friday

1215000 i wish i would have gone faster and i say that after every time i race
1215001 i am pleased that i did my best times and i went and did what i was supposed to do
1215002 i learned that i was prepared and did the best that i could do because i had spent so much time and effort in the pool just as much time as the other swimmers there
1215003 swimming against the people who were there and that much faster than me gives me a taste of what i am going to be competing against in college
1215004 i even called my older brother jared who is a swimmer for east carolina and told him that i feel like a little fish in a big pond he told me that this is a good experience for me because that is what it is going to be like at east carolina
1215005 i havent heard any news from the new shop of your brother

1215020 when you think a judge gets a decision wrong the best remedy is to appeal
1215021 i we can help with legislative reforms that create strengthen the judicial performance commission
1215022 i dont think impeachment is the proper remedy unless a crime has been committed and if you think a crime has been committed the proper channel would be to report to the police and da not the legislature
1215023 if you think the law itself is not properly written which maybe lead to the wrong result in your case we may be able to help
1215024 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
1215025 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
1215026 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
1215027 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
1215028 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
1215029 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
1215030 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
1215031 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
1215032 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
1215033 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
1215034 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
1215035 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
1215036 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
1215037 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
1215038 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
1215039 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
1215040 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
1215041 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
1215042 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
1215043 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
1215044 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
1215045 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
1215046 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
1215047 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
1215048 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
1215049 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
1215050 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
1215051 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
1215052 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
1215053 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
1215054 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
1215055 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
1215056 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make

1215109 the mention in the last statement that downside growth risks appeared to have diminished somewhat now looks like a premature conclusion
1215110 the extension and enhancement of the liquidity facilities suggests the fed remains concerned about financial stability and thus is unlikely to raise rates in the near term

1215238 you are all making history today by attending the first journalism conference in all of southern iraq
1215239 some of what will be discussed over the next couple of days will inevitably be the role of a free press in a democracy
1215240 journalists rights are guaranteed by the iraqi constitution and protected by the iraqi security forces
1215241 journalists in the past have been targeted for merely exercising their rights as journalists
1215242 we had to change our constitution to protect the rights of journalists
1215243 that change was the first amendment in a free and open place of ideas the truth will prevail
1215244 help them with finance help them by giving them training outside of iraq to give them a broader perspective and support them by buying equipment to do their jobs
1215245 a free press serves as the citizen watchdog over the government
1215246 the media inform the public about governmental activity and spark debate your job is not easy as you are expected to hold public officials to the highest standards and report whether or not the government is maintaining the public trust
1215247 man these would be really funny to watch while high

1215263 there is fear among the patients many are seeking sedatives for sleeping as the sound of the explosions still echoes in their ears
1215264 they terrorists have done what nobody would have thought of the blast was in our own backyard we were seeing people bleeding crying dying before our eyes the anger the pain of that moment was unbearable my senior broke down in tears abusing the perpetrators
1215265 it is probably this anger that propelled us to put in our best we have tried to save as many lives as we could it was more than just duty it was an answer to their cowardice
1215266 when i heard the blasts my first reaction was to run for home but halfway to the gate guilt struck and i was back in my ward
1215267 two blasts followed we were flooded with the dead wounded bleeding and burnt it was time for duty we were numb
1215268 when i returned home the next morning and saw my husband i broke down yes we are scared lekin kaam to kaam hi hain na but work is work

1215276 my people have done a great job and we are back to our normal routine
1215277 when the sacred months are over slay the idolaters wherever ye find them and take them captive

1215279 this is a great outcome for both incat and jaguar land rover
1215280 incat offers the most robust and complete set of service provisions to meet our needs with the least risk recognising that incat is also owned by tata we have been particularly sensitive to the need to treat them as we would any other vendor no advantageous insight has been available to the incat team who worked with us in a very professional manner throughout the research phase
1215281 the incat team is delighted to have the opportunity to build upon our established long term relationship with jaguar land rover
1215282 this engagement with jaguar land rover is a significant expansion of a long standing and valued relationship between our organisations the expertise that incat brings to this engagement is two fold first there is our dominant position in product development it services secondly and most importantly is our intimate knowledge of jaguar land rover including its market its products and its business objectives
1215283 the acquisition of esmark represents a significant step in severstals north american growth strategy not only does the addition of esmark bring considerable stand alone growth potential while also creating synergies with our existing us plants it solidifies severstals position as one of the leading integrated steel companies in the fast consolidating north american market we are now poised to be a leading producer and supplier of domestically produced steel to a region that has a consistent demand for high quality products

1215288 the sql injection appeared to be highly targeted affecting a single one of our boxes in australia at a rate of about 5 000 hits per day
1215289 the attack first identified a specific version and account of microsoft iis and sql server and then delivered a complex encoded sql injection payload
1215290 we saw it on about 30 boxes with each box getting some 1 000 probes a day over the next few days we saw a dramatic increase in malicious activity across several continents and from more than 40 source countries
1215291 because we knew something was up and were prepared for this dangerous threat our customers network security was not breached
1215292 this stuff is very focused and if you just have a device instead of a managed security provider with a worldwide presence this type of attack is not easy to notice that is until its too late
1215293 this instance underscores the advantages to network box customers that the company is dispersed geographically and operates as a managed service provider
1215294 as a managed service provider network boxs revenue is directly tied to keep its existing customers safe and happy otherwise they might bolt to another provider
1215295 security device makers also want happy customers but their financial interest comes from selling the next device not the current one
1215296 network boxs global footprint helped too the initial attack in australia put network box on alert with solutions to counter the attack anywhere that made their customers safer when the attack went global the following week
1215297 this is a fantastic opportunity to support the ica while networking with prominent domainers and industry leaders we have planned an event where delegates will work and play hard in an environment like no other

1215299 these companies are true leaders in the advancement of women
1215300 they all realize that moving women to the top goes beyond issues like maternity leave and flextime its also about giving women real authority to change the corporation and achieve their career dreams
1215301 for six decades manpower has provided a platform for women to enter the workforce the fact that many of our own leaders are women sets a pace and tone that energizes the organization
1215302 it is the diversity of thought and diversity of experience that these women bring as strong leaders and i am proud that manpower is being globally recognized for doing good while doing well its one of the secrets to our success
1215303 our company connects people around the world with meaningful employment a mission that anyone would get behind but what makes manpower unique is that women play a key role in leading the organization
1215304 pinks recognition is a powerful symbol that honors the hardworking women who thrive and excel at manpower while showcasing the innovative culture the company has created to recruit and reward them
1215305 the residents of eight cities and towns in the county count on us to make a wide range of information available 7x24 and we needed an affordable storage system that could grow with us while providing the highest levels of availability performance and energy efficiency the clariion cx4 system brought together all of the features we were looking for into a single system that will support our vmware environment serving more than 24 departments and agencies using a range of applications
1215306 setting the new clariion cx4 system up and managing it was simple and we immediately saw the faster performance which is especially critical for online human services and public safety applications in addition were protecting the taxpayers investment because our clariion cx4 can be easily upgraded to support future technologies that will enable our it organization to continue to offer leading information services to the citizens of our communities
1215307 with this new clariion emc is continuing to press hard to address some of the most crucial cost and management challenges faced by storage and it managers to achieve that the clariion cx4 has technical advances on so many fronts simultaneously that its hard to find much that is missing the clariion cx4s new design and built in features including flash drives are delivered in a highly modular system that can be customized for midrange users precise needs as an incumbent market leader emc faces a bar that continually gets set higher yet the clariion cx4 seems to have cleared the latest height overall this is an extremely well thought out package from emc
1215308 emc is continuing to use its significant resources and talent to incorporate the innovative features that our customers require into a single scalable and easy to use midrange platform we are again pioneering the use of flash drives this time in midrange storage and have designed these systems to take full advantage of server virtualization technology the clariion cx4 series is unmatched in the industry when it comes to scalability features energy efficiency and ease of use with this next generation of systems weve extended our technology leadership and have widened the competitive gap even further

1215349 with rampant illegal logging vague logging concession boundaries and massive blocks of pristine forest destined for the chainsaw this is a laudable step towards avoiding an ecological disaster
1215350 while the certified forests will have to be maintained according to acceptable international standards there is urgent need for other timber business operations in the region to adopt responsible forest management practices in order to ensure the conservation of this unique forest ecosystem for the benefit of people in the region and the world
1215351 illegal forest exploitation and forest crimes are largely due to poor governance and insufficient law enforcement
1215352 wwf also recognizes that responsible forest management plays an important role in the economic growth of tropical countries and reducing poverty in forest communities

1215459 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1215460 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1215461 when you lose a guy whos been here a while its always a shock maybe well start rolling now
1215462 he pitched great until the hit then kind of just lost it from that point on
1215463 i dont think he loses focus but definitely this has been a bit of a trend at times where hell be lights out and then all of a sudden just kind of hit a wall
1215464 when i was a kid growing up the oakland as would fight each other every single day thats why they called them the fighting as and they won the world championship

1215466 you always want to go out but there always comes a point of being smart
1215467 being over 100 pitches going through eight innings leaving the game is probably the best thing you dont get real caught up in the complete games and all that stuff
1215468 its really my pleasure to be able to manage a guy like doc theres not much management to it you pretty much put him out there and let him go
1215469 theres no doubt he has a little bit of everything
1215470 i dont know how he gets it to look like that really
1215471 you look up there and its the same speed but it seems like its slower or seems like its a little sharper he knows how to pitch
1215472 i felt like my curveball was better than it has been my last couple of starts
1215473 for me that was probably the biggest difference i had more confidence throwing it in different counts
1215474 i was trying to nibble way too much trying to make perfect pitches and ended up missing by a lot most of the time
1215475 he had command issues tonight right from the first batter of the game

1215491 majelis hakim tidak sependapat dengan hal yang disampaikan terdakwa dalam pledoinya sisa anggaran pos perjalanan dinas dan biaya taktis seharusnya dikembalikan pada kas negara dan dapat digunakan untuk bulan berikutnya demikian seterusnya
1215492 dengan demikian secara keseluruhan negara dalam hal ini kas daerah kalimantan timur dirugikan sebesar rp8 381 miliar dan semua pos anggaran tersebut digunakan oleh terdakwa
1215493 namun ternyata dari keterangan sejumlah saksi untuk acara rapat dinas di rumah jabatan dan pembelian karpet inventaris menggunakan dana dari sekretaris daerah bukan dari pos yang telah ditentukan
1215494 ketika itu sudah menjadi uang perjalanan dinas seharusnya menjadi milik saya namun majelis hakim menilai berbeda juga besaran uang ganti rugi terlalu besar dan berat
1215495 jadi sama sekali tidak ada penyalahgunaan kewenangan bila ada itu ada pada pengguna anggaran
1215496 majelis hakim telah punya pertimbangan lain sehingga penjara enam tahun cukup bagi kesalahan samsul

1215509 perhaps the greatest weakness of the member model has been the loss over time of its vision for the mission of the church a mission that can be characterized quite simply as participation in gods love in jesus christ for the world what we need to communicate to those outside the church is radical openness to all an openness extended from a position of strong vibrant self identity as followers of christ and participants in gods love for the world thats what the discipleship model gives us
1215510 in particular im pressing the limits even distortions that attend worldview talk which tends to now dominate christian higher education such worldviewism i suggest continues to reduce christianity to an intellectual system that can be grapsed apart from the church and is then taught as information to be merely transferred from one head to another in contrast i argue that christian discipleship is a matter of form ation not mere in formation and that christian education should be fundamentally a matter of shaping our love our desire to be oriented to the shape of the kingdom of god and such formation happens not primarily via the heady cognitive lectures whether in our protestant sermon factories or our christian college classrooms but through embodied practices that seep into our imagination and get hold of our gut our heart our kardia

1215550 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1215551 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1215552 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1215553 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1215554 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small

1215602 but would it be fair to put the economy into a deep recession or depression i dont think so
1215603 t he experience was a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces
1215604 the drastic decline in the quantity of money during those years and the occurrence of a banking panic of unprecedented severity were not the inevitable consequences of other economic changes
1215605 throughout the contraction the system had ample powers to cut short the tragic process of monetary deflation and banking collapse had it used those powers effectively in late 1930 or even in early to mid 1931 such action would have eased the severity of the contraction and very likely would have brought it to an end at a much earlier date

1215619 the knee has been struggling it has been swelling up constantly and i havent been able to train properly for 10 12 weeks so its no good
1215620 i had an arthroscope to try and clear the damage but the knee just hasnt come up right
1215621 its very very disappointing im gutted its not a good thing that before the season starts you find out youre not going to be part of it but in the end you just have to move on and get on with it
1215622 i will keep training and working hard with my rehabilitation because i am still contracted to the club and hopefully i can recover and get through this
1215623 we went into the pre season cup with an attitude around getting some quality games under our belts but the further we went we started thinking hang on we can go somewhere and maybe have a shot at winning this
1215624 now were in the final we want to win it the feeling in the change room and at training is just unbelievable
1215625 the belief within the team is there thats what is really noticeable weve recruited well this year and weve got a good group of boys in but its the belief within the group thats key when youve got quality players onboard and everyone has faith in themselves and each other then everything else takes care of itself
1215626 the first competition game is the important one and theres still work to do before then but were in a final now and were going to try and win it hopefully we can take a winning feeling into the first game of the new season
1215627 for a club thats been around less than 18 months its a pretty significant achievement
1215628 we havent changed how weve gone about things in pre season weve covered all the bases and now were in a final melbourne are bringing a good side and itll be great for our fans to see another match at the ring of fire to have the final at home is unique and thats very positive for the club
1215629 he has that kind of response when he comes to the plate

1215655 we suspect that the suspects may have been involved in some of that as well
1215656 we are developing a case for all of those schools as much as we can following up
1215657 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector to a single overarching goal in ten years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1215658 washington finally made some progress in this its a plan that will invest in renewable fuels and fuel efficient cars like all compromises this has its drawbacks a limited amount of off shore drilling im willing to consider it if its going to pass
1215659 and another vital part of that is offshore drilling we have to drill here and we have to drill now not wait and see if theres areas to be explored not and wait and see if theres a package to be put together but drill here and drill now

1215663 we are in an era of a persistent conflict with hazards and threats to be dealt with
1215664 this ship represents a remarkable step forward not only in capability and capacity but also in the competency of this crew today the crew will bring this ship to life and bertholf will be up to the challenges of the 21st century
1215665 he pietersen is a fine player and has confidence in bucket loads which he will probably take into his captaincy
1215666 but you dont want him to change he averages around 50 in both forms of the game and hes an unbelievable talent
1215667 he has got some very important attributes that you need in a captain
1215668 he can clearly lead by example by being a fantastic player
1215669 he is a very confident person and he is pretty decisive as well when tough decisions are there to be made he is going to make those decisions
1215670 after studying the schedule of real madrid and the dutch team i realised playing for both teams would mean too tough a physical load for me and therefore i made this choice
1215671 im taking no chances and after the enjoyable euro 2008 finals i can look back upon my decision with a good feeling

1215679 at this juncture the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained
1215680 we will follow developments in the subprime market closely however fundamental factors including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates should ultimately support the demand for housing and at this point the troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
1215681 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy
1215682 weve got strong financial institutions our markets are the envy of the world theyre resilient theyre innovative theyre flexible i think we move very quickly to address situations in this country and as i said our financial institutions are strong
1215683 in one way im sympathetic to the institutional reluctance to face the music id give a lot to mark my weight to model rather than to market
1215684 today i can say that we will not need additional funds these problems are behind us we will not return to the market
1215685 we deliberately raised more capital than we lost last year we believe that will allow us to not have to go back to the equity market in the foreseeable future
1215686 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital

1215688 lenders would have to curtail loans by roughly 10 to one to preserve their capital ratios this would imply a further contraction of credit by up to 12 trillion worldwide unless banks could raise fresh capital
1215689 the correct calculation of the asset values and their relationship to securities or creditors claims depends on the purposes of the analyst
1215690 it is customary to eliminate intangibles in the computation of the net asset value or equity per share of common stock
1215691 the fear is that a going concern opinion can hasten the demise of an already troubled company reduce a loan officers willingness to grant a line of credit to that troubled company or increase the point spread that would be charged if that company were granted a loan auditors are placed at the center of a moral and ethical dilemma whether to issue a going concern opinion and risk escalating the financial distress of their client or not issue a going concern opinion and risk not informing interested parties of the possible failure of the company

1215700 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
1215701 he suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas
1215702 my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on foreign oil i dont think so
1215703 keep tires properly inflated and aligned to improve your gasoline mileage by around 3 3

1215714 durante estas dos jornadas que se han disputado el equipo ha mostrado una gran actitud pero tambi n debo reconocer que en nuestro reciente partido llegamos un poco cansados tras disputar un juego muy intenso a media semana en el superliga sin embargo estamos tranquilos porque durante este par de semanas que fue el arranque del torneo el equipo a trabajado fuerte para que conforme trascurran las jornadas se demuestre que este grupo tiene la capacidad para estar en la pelea
1215715 en cierta parte nos afect el poco tiempo que tuvimos para recuperanos y enfocarnos de lleno a nuestro rival pero una de las principales causas que termin por sentenciar el empate sin goles es que tuvimos un partido muy parejo desde el principio y sobre todo que ambos equipos no mostraron un buen ritmo
1215716 yo estoy con toda la tranquilidad as es que voy a tratar de devolver un poquito de toda la confianza que me est n dando
1215717 a m m xico me dio mucho y toda mi vida futbol stica la hice ac salvo dos a os que jugu en argentina toda la vida futbol stica la hice ac y yo creo que hubiese optado por m xico
1215718 a leandro lo conozco tambi n pero estar con mis compa eros me da m s tranquilidad
1215719 siempre voy a aceptar y entender las cr ticas negativas pero voy a tratar de hacer lo mejor y entregarme para el bien de la selecci n mexicana y adaptarse a la idea de lo que quiere el entrenador
1215720 las cr ticas siempre van a existir y voy a tratar de hacer lo mejor y a olvidar lo que dicen afuera de la cancha para enfocarme nada m s en lo que son los entrenamientos
1215721 l gicamente que hay que ganar un lugar hay que buscar una oportunidad dentro de los jugadores que van a estar pero de ninguna manera me siento presionado es algo que me motiva a trabajar para ganarme un lugar
1215722 no estamos menospreciando a nadie es una empresa que se dedica al alto rendimiento y consideramos que la experiencia que adquirido durante todo el tiempo que se ha dedicado a esto nos puede ayudar a llegar a instancias mucho m s altas
1215723 platic con sven y con el doctor y decidieron que era mejor que regresara a su club para iniciar una rehabilitaci n
1215724 platicamos muchas cosas un poco de reglas por qu estamos aqu el gran objetivo que sabemos todos que es el 2010 el mundial en sud frica y tambi n otras cosas que hay que decir dentro del grupo pero vamos a hablar m s ma ana t cticamente
1215725 la mejor regla es la calidad los jugadores que van a estar en la cancha es porque son o en ese momento eran los mejores la mejor regla las m s trasparente la m s justa de todas las reglas la m s sencilla son aquellos que se ganan el puesto titular y se ganan el puesto para ser convocados
1215726 yo creo que el mundo es un mundo abierto globalizado y no s por qu quieren hacer una discusi n al respecto conmigo no hay objeci n nada m s que ustedes han mencionado muchas veces la regla entonces ya di la regla
1215727 lo que estamos terminando de cerrar es una metodolog a una forma de trabajo metodolog as hay muchas cada preparador f sico tiene una metodolog a cada t cnico tiene una metodolog a cada entrenador de porteros tiene una metodolog a lo que nosotros estamos terminando y por donde seguramente va a cerrarse el c rculo es con una metodolog a de trabajo
1215728 pues es una luxaci n del hombro izquierdo que la semana pasada me pas afortunadamente no fue la clav cula pues hubiera sido m s fuerte
1215729 ser an dos semanas con el brazo inmovilizado y m nimo otra para recuperaci n comenzar a correr eso es lo que yo espero es lo que se tiene planeado y que de ah ojal no haya ning n problema no por quedar mal sino que ya me perd la primer semana por una lesi n en la rodilla sal de esa para entrar en otra espero salir pronto para estar apoyando a mis compa eros
1215730 con la terapia estamos buscando que me recupere pronto pero tambi n s que es un poco delicado por la zona y que m nimo tengo que estar dos semanas con el brazo inmovilizado para que el tend n se recupere
1215731 veo que el equipo est muy bien no tenemos que buscar excusas estamos preparados
1215732 ser complicado est claro pero el equipo est trabajando muy bien cada d a est mejor
1215733 porque la temporada es muy larga y hay muchas competiciones
1215734 pero en estos momentos con los que tengo estoy m s que satisfecho
1215735 no no me siento presionado porque sab a que cuando samuel juega tiene grandes posibilidades de marcar goles porque lo ha hecho siempre
1215736 es un jugador a mi disposici n que lo utilizo cuando creo necesario
1215737 como espero de cualquier otro compa ero mientras sea jugador nuestro
1215738 est trabajando como siempre con much simas ganas y con mucha ilusi n no lo veo distinto a ning n a o anterior
1215739 no he encontrado nada hasta ahora todo est bien y si un d a hay algo debemos hacer algo pero de momento todo est bien
1215740 messi es un jugador importante para nosotros lo nico que tenemos que hacer es esperar si vuelve o no pero con o sin l tenemos que seguir trabajando y si no vuelve desearle mucha suerte en las olimpiadas y nosotros a cumplir con nuestro trabajo
1215741 la verdad vienen partidos complicados pero el equipo est bien nos preparamos bastante bien en la pretemporada y creo que lo podemos sacar adelante
1215742 estoy contento la verdad que es para lo que uno trabaja y es satisfactorio poder ayudar al equipo
1215743 trabajo y dedicaci n s de donde vengo mis ra ces y eso es lo que me ha ayudado bastante pensar en las cosas que quiero que deseo y que las puedo lograr porque me conozco s como soy son mis metas y las voy a lograr a como d lugar
1215744 son muy buenos tanto en la defensa media y delantera tienen jugadores que son de selecci n saben manejar bien el bal n y ser un juego complicado
1215745 puede que s pero eso ya lo decidir el profe jos luis trejo nosotros estamos trabajando y si me toca ser titular pues habr que hacerlo igual que cuando me toca entrar de cambio
1215746 no no me conforma a cualquier jugador no le gusta estar en la banca en mi caso tampoco pero son decisiones y nosotros trabajamos para aportar dentro de la cancha aqu lo importante es que se ha hecho un bonito grupo y muy s lido uno trata siempre de ser honesto y trabajar dentro de la cancha uno quisiera jugar siempre de titular y ah estoy metiendo presi n pero esto es un grupo y vamos adelante
1215747 la verdad es que pens bamos en sacar la mayor cantidad de puntos posibles el equipo se ha comportado a la altura y eso es importante me ha tocado entrar y hacer cosas buenas pero eso es parte de mi trabajo si me toca entrar tengo que hacerlo bien
1215748 hay que sacar el mayor n mero de puntos en estas fechas queremos mantenernos arriba de la tabla vamos ante cruz azul con la mentalidad de sacar una victoria si es un empate tambi n es bueno pero vamos con ese primer prop sito

1215764 the uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
1215765 it is hm governments position that evidence held by the uk government that us and moroccan authorities engaged in torture or rendition cannot be obtained
1215766 if it is correct that in the course of an interrogation in which material supplied by the defendant hm government was employed the claimant binyam mohamed was tortured then it is arguable that there is an obligation to disclose material which may assist claimant in establishing before the american military court that he was tortured whether the court should exercise its discretion not to order disclosure can only be determined at a full hearing
1215767 the security and intelligence agencies were mixed up in wrongdoing in cooperating with the us in the unlawful treatment
1215768 cooperate with his interrogators when the officer saw him after he was first captured in pakistan
1215769 did not press the us to tell them where mohamed was being held after he was transferred from pakistan and in what conditions
1215770 must have known the treatment mohamed was likely to face in pakistan given the history of the pakistan authorities
1215771 did not dispute that mohamed was held incommunicado for three months in pakistan but did not accept the conditions in which he was held there were unlawful
1215772 it now conceded that he was in a location unknown
1215773 refused to say whether mohamed was ever taken to morocco

1215783 not one witness said he had any role in the terrorist attacks themselves

1215791 your thoughts create your world and your words indicate your thoughts when you eliminate complaining from your life you will enjoy happier relationships better health and greater prosperity this simple program helps you set a trap for your own negativity and redirect your mind towards a more positive and rewarding life
1215792 complaining spreads negative energy and negative energy cannot create a positive outcome

1215796 my husband only lived six weeks after his diagnosis of lung cancer
1215797 the only way to know if youre living with high levels of radon is to test your home cause you cant see it you cant smell it you cant taste it
1215798 we know how to build homes with quality we know how to build homes with safety
1215799 it could be a feeling of false security if you build a new home youve got this system you dont think you need radon detection or mitigation
1215800 i built a new house six years ago and i wasnt aware of this maybe i probably done something different but since i have maybe its something i need to look at
1215801 over two and a half years ago i was very confident in my ignorance about radon i knew my home had no radon we had a tight basement and our home was only 20 years old i was so wrong
1215802 we were stuck there with four adult leaders 10 boys and no place to go
1215803 certainly we have to be on the side of safety with our boys and im glad that they did close it but a little more notice wouldve helped us
1215804 we had an open campsite which is unusual we usually fill up very quickly so we were able to accommodate them and happy to do it
1215805 quite frankly i dont think they even knew the difference
1215806 my goal is for them to have the same experience that they bought and paid for we made the best out of a bad situation

1215838 a strain of curious left of center analysis im seeing more and more this election that the republicans are losing because limited government ideas dont work and are no longer popular this critique requires a significant leap of logic that george w bush and his would be gop successor john mccain practice and or believe in limited government principles

1215851 we now know that the immune system of patients recovering from chemotherapy is malleable so we just need to find the best immunologic approach to exploit this window of opportunity
1215852 the good news was the surprisingly nice t cell response patients had to the flu vaccination even relatively soon after completing chemotherapy
1215853 that shows that the general idea of using immunotherapy following chemotherapy to prevent recurrence is not a flawed one chemotherapy depleted the immune system but we could restore it
1215854 was not very immunogenic we have a long way to go to optimizing this vaccine

1215860 we investigators spent 20 years attempting to learn about these animals on the high seas and temperate ocean waters with only slow progress
1215861 this work will be useful for marine resource managers and others who want to understand how leatherbacks spend their days in the new england region and beyond
1215862 weve never known whether theyre coming to forage or just passing through

1215864 we assumed that telemedicine was a good idea but it hadnt been scientifically tested until now
1215865 using stroke doc our stroke team physicians were able to evaluate the patient and help make the correct decision about treatment over 98 percent of the time compared to only 82 percent of the time when doing a telephone consultation to a remote site
1215866 when a person suffers a stroke time is of the essence
1215867 if you make a poor decision using a telephone consultation you potentially put the patient at risk for a poor outcome
1215868 the question we set out to ask with this five year study was did we make the right decision the answer was overwhelmingly yes
1215869 rural physicians can now provide much needed specialty care to their patients via telemedicine
1215870 this is welcome news for rural healthcare providers in the u s
1215871 what this study tells us is that we need a bigger trial to determine the difference if any in clinical outcomes for these patients
1215872 children have no control over their family situation so its encouraging to find that the amount of quality time that they have with their parents is largely unaffected by their family arrangement
1215873 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
1215874 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large in our particular study a six fold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
1215875 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
1215876 people who have or suspect that they have sleep apnea should consult their physicians about diagnosis and treatment options

1215937 turkeys governing party narrowly avoids ban ruling strikes balance between countrys radical secularists and akps moderate islamic constituency
1215938 turkeys ruling party escapes court ban turkey stepped back from the brink of political turmoil yesterday when the ruling party narrowly escaped closure over its alleged islamist tendencies
1215939 turkish courts decision a warning for ruling party its now akps turn constitutional court verdict is a serious warning that could spark problem for the ruling partys image
1215940 it marks a turning point in a decade long showdown that has seen the staunchly secularist army and courts facing off against a new moderately islamic middle class that has come to dominate turkeys economy and society during that time ending the countrys nationalist isolationism and pushing turkey to join europe embrace free trade and end its conflicts with ethnic minorities
1215941 the ruling which also cut off half of the akps state funding was seen by turkish observers to strike a balance between the radical secularism that has governed turkey for eight decades and the popularity and economic success created by the akp allowing both to remain intact if so it represents a very new sort of thinking in a country that has usually solved such disputes by having the military seize power
1215942 instead the court decided to cut the partys treasury funding for this year by half amounting to a slap on the wrist for ak which stirred controversy by promoting muslim headscarves
1215943 the courts chairman insisted the fine was a warning i hope the party in question will evaluate the outcome very well and get the message it should get said hasim kilic the only judge to vote to reject the case
1215944 in its ruling the constitutional court penalized the justice and development party known by its turkish initials akp with financial sanctions that represent a loss of about half the partys subsidy from the government treasury
1215945 the verdict was greeted with evident relief by the akp cabinet minister faruk celik called it a victory for turkish democracy the party had steadfastly denied the charges and said they were politically motivated
1215946 and he said on wednesday everybody should make necessary efforts to reduce political tension in turkey from now on and urged political parties to take the legal steps for toughening party closure conditions
1215947 the message and the details of the ruling of the constitutional court should be read carefully
1215948 in other words 10 members of the court said akp had taken steps that harm the secularism principle in the country thats why the ruling is a serious warning for the governing party as kilic said and its activities would continue to be monitored by state organs
1215949 the akp had been convicted for committing a crime against secularism by the 10 of the 11 members of the constitutional court so that the akp was not acquitted by the constitutional court murat yetkin
1215950 he said prime minister tayyip erdogan and the akp should now think twice before taking any steps because every action of the ruling party would be assessed under the shadow of the courts ruling
1215951 killing 17 five of them children and injuring more than 150 in the deadliest attack against civilians in turkey in almost five years
1215952 holds out the promise of a free public culture equally open to devout muslims secularists and critics of turkeys past politics something the country has never known
1215953 on the eve of a major court case that could lead to the closure of the governing justice and development or ak party
1215954 bombings and the legal challenge to the government highlight a growing mood of uncertainty in turkey where an islamic oriented government that won a strong mandate in elections last year is locked in a power struggle with secular circles in the military and judiciary
1215955 prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served as a pallbearer at a funeral monday for some of the 17 people killed by bombs in turkeys biggest city an attack the government blamed on kurdish rebels who have targeted civilians in the past
1215956 rebel kurdistan workers party pkk immediately denied responsibility and attributed sundays attack to dark forces hard line turkish nationalists who allegedly seek to foment chaos to strengthen the political influence of the military turkey is home to a variety of violent groups besides the pkk including islamic extremists and alleged coup plotters with ties to the secular establishment
1215957 said the bombings appeared to be a reprisal for air raids on pkk positions in northern iraq as well as a cross border ground offensive by the turkish military in february
1215958 police studying surveillance videos identified a possible suspect as turkish warplanes bombed kurdish rebels in northern iraq officials have accused the separatist kurdistan workers party the police who have established a description of the terrorist are working on the presumption that he came alone from the qandil mountains where the pkk has its main stronghold
1215959 shadowy ergenekon nationalist group which is alleged to have organised attacks and plotted assassinations to foment political turmoil and pave the way for a military coup against prime minister erdogans current turkish government
1215960 when it was allegedly discovered that a house in the mraniye district of istanbul was being
1215961 alleged members were the claims about the organization widely reported in the turkish press ever since read like a thriller they allege the gang was plotting to bring down the government it is claimed their plan was to assassinate a string of turkish intellectuals including nobel laureate orhan pamuk fomenting chaos and provoking a military intervention in 2009 a menu of targets had already been drawn up and a hitman hired when the police swooped according to the daily hurriyet sabah newspaper linked the gang to the murder of three protestant christians and turkish armenian journalist hrant dink those details apparently leaked by police have never been officially confirmed
1215962 bulent kenes the editor in chief of todays zaman the most circulated english daily in turkey
1215963 no one is claiming responsibility for the bombs in istanbul but the finger of suspicion points at a shady ultra nationalist group
1215964 hopefully these terrorist acts have no chance at reversing the turkish peoples eagerness to make turkey a much more transparent and much more democratic country because the overwhelming majority of the turkish people want a more transparent more democratic regime the attacks fortunately do not bear the potential to deter the turkish people from these demands
1215965 on the eve of a major court case that could lead to the closure of the governing justice and development or ak party
1215966 there are close links between ergenekon and the closure case at the top court
1215967 trojan horse for islamism as severe as one finds in iran or saudi arabia
1215968 turkish peoples eagerness to make turkey a much more transparent and much more democratic country
1215969 has accused prime minister erdogans governing ak party of bringing islamic practices into politics to replace the secular regime with a more religious one in violation of the founding principles of the turkish republic if found guilty 71 senior members of the party including the current president and the prime minister could be banned from politics for five years the court is expected to reach its verdict in a couple of weeks
1215970 also came just two days after a criminal court accepted the indictment of ergenekon
1215971 turkey has long been full of rumours of violent patriotic gangs by offering harder evidence than before of links between violent groups at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum the ergenekon case has sparked unprecedented soul searching in a country that once saw the state as a largely benevolent father in private everybody talks about alleged links to the pkk
1215972 ergenekon and the pkk have different aims but theyre both terrorist gangs of course they could work together
1215973 after islamic militants linked to al qaeda carried out suicide bombings in november 2003 that targeted two synagogues the british consulate and a british bank in istanbul

1215978 adventures visiting my good friend ned in istanbul during july of 2007
1215979 today ned and i took a bus most of the way up the bosporus to the neighborhood of istinye in order to visit the american consulate ned had to fill out a piece of paperwork that essentially asserts that hes not married this is the first step in getting married in turkey when youre an american whether youre marrying a turk or not it doesnt matter when we arrived in istinye we inquired about the location of the us consulate a local directed us toward ned didnt know exactly what to expect but hed heard that the consulate is a very large and brutal looking building we rounded a corner and sure enough on the hillside up ahead was one of the ugliest buildings ive ever seen the consulate is not really designed to be accessible by foot typically american i suppose
1215980 three unidentified gunmen and three turkish policemen were killed wednesday in an attack on a police guard post at the main entrance of the well fortified us consulate in istanbul that officials labeled a terrorist act one person has been taken into custody
1215981 the three assailants jumped from a car and opened fire at the police checkpoint around 11 am 0800 gmt officials told reporters adding that they also fired shots at the building the security forces returned fire killing all three gunmen
1215982 there is no doubt that this is a terrorist attack istanbul gov
1215983 yavuz erkut yuksel a bystander told cnn turk television the attackers emerged from a white vehicle and surprised the guard one of them approached a policeman while hiding his gun and shot him in the head yuksel said
1215984 guler said two of the attackers were turkish nationals this somewhat contradicts three of the assailants who were killed during the attack were of turkish origin above but that is what the source says police were pursuing a fourth attacker who reportedly escaped in a car a us embassy spokeswoman said there were no reports of casualties among american consulate employees but could not confirm turkish media reports of injuries and deaths
1215985 turkish broadcasters cnn turk and ntv said without citing sources that the three gunmen from east turkey were suspected of being members of al qaeda
1215986 ulus durgut 24 who was in the process of entering the us consulate compound said the gunbattle lasted 15 minutes the terrorists were bearded men and had long hair mr durgut told reuters mutlu gunes a 13 year old eyewitness said that he was on his way to a mosque when he spotted several men preparing guns and placing them inside a ford focus car before driving to the nearby consulate the three of them got out of the car one of them shot a policeman in the chest and i saw one terrorist killing himself after being shot by police then i hid under a car he said
1215987 on a day of instability in turkey it emerged that
1215988 if the pkk is proven to have carried out the kidnapping it would be a rare tactic for the separatist group whose activities are mainly focused on attacking military targets in southeast turkey

1216001 the attack coincides with political tension in turkey the governing party is fighting to avoid being banned for alleged anti secular activities and police are probing a shadowy far right group suspected of plotting a military coup

1216011 evaluated from the perspective of schoolyard quarrels this past weeks exchange between st phane dion and stephen harper can be seen in either of two ways
1216012 david gergen who has advised republican and democratic presidents said what we have learnt this week is that when the republican attack machine cranks up as hillary clinton predicted obama is actually pretty vulnerable
1216013 john mccain has taken some questionable swipes at barack obama including a bizarre new campaign advertisement that compares the presumptive democratic nominee to paris hilton and britney spears but for mr obama to come close to accusing his republican opponent of racism is worse having previously won praise for running a positive and optimistic campaign mr obama has now helped insert an ugly element into the u s presidential race
1216014 since his world tour last month senator obama has been subjected to withering critiques by the mccain camp that have portrayed him as arrogant presumptuous addicted to celebrity and too elitist to connect with mainstream us voters his lead in some national opinion polls has disappeared and two surveys at the weekend showed the candidates tied

1216032 has a history of flipping back and forth between the grits and tories having been held by the conservatives when former prime minister brian mulroney was in office
1216033 conservatives seem to be so intent on the seat that brent barr was ousted as the candidate amid controversy and was replaced by gloria kovach a long time municipal councillor
1216034 the bloc is nonetheless expected to hold on to saint lambert a riding that was liberal until 2004
1216035 guelph and westmount are especially important to liberals if the liberals do well in these ridings they now hold its believed theyll be emboldened to defeat the government and force a vote before the end of this year if they do poorly as they did in last falls by elections when they lost one of their safe seats in quebec to the ndp i e mr mulcair as above then all bets are off for a campaign this fall and canadians could see harper stay in office until the october 2009 date set under his fixed term election legislation rumours persist that the tories may hold off the return of the commons to november making it all but impossible for the government to be defeated before christmas that said however poor liberal showings could make the tories even more anxious to try to provoke their own defeat in parliament this fall and trigger an election

1216083 the decision to exclude puerto ricans from the hispanic incidence analysis is perplexing
1216084 the cdc made a positive step forward in its original decision to include hispanics but has subsequently taken two steps back by again excluding puerto ricans from the hispanic incidence rates we will never have accurate estimate of hiv incidence in the hispanic community if this discrimination continues
1216085 we call on everyone to mobilize demand respect and call for recognition from cdc of the health crisis that hiv aids represents in our latino hispanic communities in the united states puerto rico and the u s virgin islands

1216092 recently i had the opportunity to share with a group of city employees the definition of leadership
1216093 in every position i have accepted i have given my all to live up to that definition when my ability to do so is compromised i believe it is in my personal best interest and the interest of taxpayers to move on
1216094 i am going to take the opportunity in the next chapter of my life to give back more to the community i believe i can use all that i have learned over the years to coach emerging leaders and to work collaboratively on non profit and private sector initiatives
1216095 i would like to thank everyone for their support and to apologize to those ive disappointed best wishes and godspeed to all city employees

1216101 which would allow users to purchase access to the internet at a given minimum data rate and be free to transfer data at at least up to that rate in any way they wish
1216102 mama i may be sitting down on the outside but im standing up on the inside

1216106 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
1216107 the word became a human being and lived with us and we saw his shkhinah the shkhinah of the fathers only son full of grace and truth

1216110 in the first four books g d spoke directly to moshe
1216111 it was as if g d was speaking to the jewish nation through the throat of moshe
1216112 in contrast to these four books where the story and or mitzvot are presented in third person the style of sefer devarim is very different for it is written almost entirely in first person the reason for this is quite simple sefer devarim consists of a collection of speeches delivered by moshe rabeinu before his death
1216113 this teaches us that he rebuked them only a short while before his death
1216114 reuben my son i will tell you why i have not reproved you for your shortcomings during all these years so that you would not leave me and join my brother esau
1216115 his message to the jews was dont be afraid sichon and og were tremendous giants who lived at the border of the promised land in their role as protectors of the canaanite kings the source of their strength was the angels who had fathered them they were angels who had protested the creation of man because they were angels they were unable to grasp that man by overcoming his physical nature was in fact stronger than the angels by defeating sichon and og in battle moses showed the jews that one who keeps the torah can overcome the canaanite kings and all they represent as well
1216116 the opening words of moshe in dvarim are a recount of the disappointing events surrounding their 40 years of wandering the people are poised to go into the land but first their past actions warrants a personal rebuke told in first person from moshe hence our connection to the rebuke of the haftarah portion
1216117 if you come in now what will people say that it was you who have caused the flock to be carried off
1216118 your greatness is that you have taken the 600 000 out of bondage but you have buried them in the desert and will bring into the land a different generation this being so people will think that the generation of the desert have no share in the world to come no better be beside them and you shall in the time to come enter with them
1216119 ordinarily we attribute moses and aarons punishment with the sin of striking the rock at meribah num 20 the incident with the spies however predates the sin of moses and aaron at the waters of meribah by 38 years thirty eight years before the crime of striking the rock was committed their sentence was passed a generation before they committed the sin their punishment was announced perhaps the punishment was as much a justification for the sentence that they were already under as it was a punishment for striking the rock such is the fate of the righteous though they do not share in the sin of their generation they often share in its punishment the destiny of moses was sealed with that of the people he led
1216120 if i may not enter it the promised land in my lifetime let me reach it after my death
1216121 in israel none like moshe arose again a prophet who perceived his vision clearly
1216122 in israel arose again a prophet who perceived his vision clearly
1216123 when king solomon dedicated the first temple he prayed and began to prophesy during this prayer he prophesied the destruction of the temple and told us how to obtain atonement and forgiveness both with and without it
1216124 the destruction of the temple and told us how to obtain atonement and forgiveness both
1216125 and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and unto this house
1216126 and it shall be answered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them
1216127 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land
1216128 on the seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering to the lord seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily for seven days and a kid of the goats daily for a sin offering

1216132 there is no intimate connection between us it is ridiculous to think that way we are good friends and britney is the most charming person in the world but i am not sleeping there rather working at her house during the day and then returning to my own home
1216133 aint it awful if those little girls slept with as many men as they say in the tabloids why their little butts would have more fingerprints than the fbi
1216134 i kinda feel sorry for them we should give those two a break

1216141 the short was made with jason stone who had just graduated from usc and wanted to have a calling card for potential directing jobs
1216142 they put the trailer on youtube and now its a feature film at some point next year
1216143 its just weird that i will be in a movie where my name is in the title
1216144 its amazing people think that the world wants to see a movie about two canadians arguing during the apocalypse i mean i know i do and my mother does
1216145 i still dont know how it will play out with this one
1216146 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how the strong the movie will be
1216147 this is surprising since an earlier thermal and evolved gas analyzer measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1216148 while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1216149 i felt i was cutting through and soaring above the water

1216152 tests on more than 100 different fabrics and suit designs and body scans of more than 400 elite swimmers
1216153 theres a flotation percentage calibrated there has to be a permeability of the material the suit cant float on its own
1216154 you dont want to be spending too much time in that kind of environment
1216155 other than pulling my treadmill into the garage starting the car and hoping i come out two hours later there isnt really a lot i can do to get ready for it
1216156 i wouldnt be surprised if it would knock a little bit out of their performance
1216157 if theyre racing around on really smoggy days i would not be surprised if no world records are set at outdoor events
1216158 i did quite a bit of data on particulate matter and pollutants and the pulmonary function test conducted on several canadian athletes in beijing
1216159 that checks a persons ability to expand air and transfer oxygen to the lungs
1216160 i think the pollution woes have been a little bit overdone by the media
1216161 but were sending the message loud and clear that its important not to get distracted from the real environmental factor likely to detract from performance the heat and humidity
1216162 some of us have already used the ice vests that kind of help precool you a little bit before the race to fend off the heat for the first bit
1216163 athletes are also working with cool drinks and strategies throwing cold water on ourselves and anything basically to try and keep the body temperature down its going to be pretty extreme heat
1216164 it could be the kind of thing where it finishes somewhat like a triathlon guys just coming in minutes apart from each other and 30 finishers
1216165 i dont know if its necessarily a good thing but everyones on the same page
1216166 the convincingness of a true work of art is completely irrefutable and it forces even an opposing heart to surrender
1216167 it was his steadfast belief in good and evil and his conviction that he was destined to play a part in the struggle between them that made solzhenitsyns one of the emblematic lives of the 20th century with his passing we have lost one of our last links to the era of soviet tyranny and the struggle to defeat it solzhenitsyn did not play the same kind of political role in that struggle as some of the other giants of the 20th century with whom his name should be remembered pope john paul ii ronald reagan margaret thatcher but as a writer and witness his contribution was no less crucial
1216168 its a 45 day minimum notification but we certainly expect and were watching very carefully to see20whether or not north korea is going to come through on the essential issue which is verification and to act accordingly
1216169 i just wanted to clarify its a 45 day minimum notification not maximum
1216170 nobody is going to trust the north korean number on how much plutonium they need one of the facts is that in this process thus far we have learned more about some activities questionable activities in north korea than frankly we had learned before we engaged in this process
1216171 fortunately there are very good tried and true as one of my colleagues called it yesterday international internationally recognized methods to verify the number of kilograms of plutonium make
1216172 so they keep pushing themselves and pushing themselves and not letting anybody know that hey im running on empty and then it catches up on them and then they collapse
1216173 as a fierce artist yourself you know what its like to feel the fever
1216174 oh my god oh my gooooooooodddddddd come get it come get it

1216177 bol var fuerte al pa s fuerte a la econom a fuerte
1216178 it seems that we are hosting an anger management class
1216179 whether its called the power to remove these are impeachment hearings
1216180 what were here for is something called impeachment lite were sort of in that never neverland of accusing the president of impeachable offenses but not taking actions to impeach him which i guess impugns him but does not impeach him but maybe it has the same effect in the court of public opinion
1216181 if lying about consensual sexual activity fits the bill for impeachment then certainly lying to the american people about the reason for invading iraq qualifies as an official excuse me as an impeachable offense
1216182 nothing is going to come out of this hearing with regard to impeachment
1216183 the democratic leadership has said time and again they have no intention of bringing any impeachment resolution
1216184 i know that many here today on both sides of the rostrum and many looking in are anxious to debate whether the 43rd president of the united states should be impeached and id like to address myself to that issue in my opening remarks
1216185 i want to take the chairman at his word this morning that this hearing is not about impeachment
1216186 and therefore i hope we can expect that none of the witnesses will even mention the word impeachment
1216187 i dont know precisely when and i cannot discuss it further without getting into classified information
1216188 im especially pleased to welcome harrison ford bo derek and ilia lagutenko
1216189 mr fords environmental work may not be his best known work but it could be some of his most important projects even though hes been very busy with his latest film hes graciously taken time to be with us
1216190 was terribly ill served by his top advisers especially those involved directly in national security
1216191 most people on the outside are not familiar with hadley
1216192 i think the only solution is for me to resign
1216193 confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war
1216194 during the cold war nuclear weapons dominated our national security perspective
1216195 on state actors are active on both ends of the supply chain
1216196 the iaea had no enforcement mandate no ability to inspect nuclear materials in transit or take punitive measures against violators and only limited capacity to detect covert nuclear activities
1216197 cops and criminals do not coexist in the organization psi is a group of nations committed to be cops
1216198 the lights are not on and the microphones are not on
1216199 the republican agenda the change you deserve is directed at americas families
1216200 and you may be a little surprised at this agenda
1216201 are depression symptoms keeping you from where you want to be
1216202 celebrating the role of mothers in the united states and supporting the goals and ideals of mothers day
1216203 oh we just wanted to make sure that everyone was on record in support of mothers day
1216204 i think mr fossella is going to have some decisions to make over the weekend
1216205 theres been a change theres no press allowed no interviews no filming nothing
1216206 i dont know if it was someone trying to sabotage us
1216207 because god said my top priority for the jewish people is to get them to come back to the land of israel
1216208 people who know nothing about you and whove never read a complete transcript of anything youve said
1216209 it is more important than ever that pro israel christians make their voices heard
1216210 five years ago today president bush addressed our nation and the world from the uss abraham lincoln only 42 days after he ordered the invasion of iraq he declared mission accomplished
1216211 one thousand eight hundred and twenty seven days later the u s occupation of iraq continues and our mission remains undefined
1216212 i was going to wear my field uniform today but i decided it didnt fit
1216213 president bush is well aware that the banner should have been much more specific and said mission accomplished for these sailors who are on this ship on their mission
1216214 its almost beyond my belief that they would think anybody would believe that
1216215 im sure the white house didnt tell her to say that
1216216 five years ago today president bush made an outrageous claim a claim that has become the symbol of his incompetence and the failure in iraq
1216217 five years ago today on the deck of an aircraft carrier returning from the middle east america and the world bore witness to perhaps the greatest act of hubris that our nation has ever seen in wartime
1216218 resplendent in a flight suit landing theatrically in a fighter jet
1216219 once again george bushs record and americas reputation will go down in flames
1216220 we have certainly paid a price for not being more specific on that banner
1216221 and i recognize that the media is going to play this up again tomorrow as they do every single year
1216222 given the inevitable attention on this day and what the president said five years ago on the lincoln is there any reason the white house didnt schedule an event for the president to talk about it a lot on his terms it sort of gives the impression you want this anniversary to pass as quickly as possible
1216223 is what were doing now to make sure that mission continues to show success
1216224 we shouldnt in a sense be surprised when the data are are soft
1216225 i it seems you know it seems like thats thats enough uh enough
1216226 i dont i guess i dont have an answer i mean you know beyond saying we look at all the data and um so my usual line
1216227 his temperament is wrong hes wrong on the war hes wrong on the economy
1216228 the unprecedented firing of nine u s attorneys in 2006
1216229 this meeting today is a travesty of a mockery of a sham
1216230 some will win some will lose some are born to sing the blues and the movie never ends it goes on and on and on and on
1216231 its not enough to play defense we need to score
1216232 more people have voted for me than have voted for my opponent
1216233 if we had the same rules as the republicans i would be the nominee right now
1216234 the states i have won total 300 electoral votes my opponent has won states totaling 217 electoral votes
1216235 west virginia is one of those so called swing states democrats need to win in the fall
1216236 i want to start by winning it in the spring to lay the groundwork for a victory in november
1216237 i hope next tuesday you will give me a chance to be your president
1216238 we now know who the democratic nominee is going to be
1216239 hillary having trouble finding superdelegates who will meet with her
1216240 thankfully for us the punditocracy does not control this nominating process
1216241 i think she can pull it off she can still do it
1216242 she should drop out she should do it graciously she should do it soon
1216243 i am so proud of her victory last night in indiana
1216244 we were very excited about our come from behind victory in indiana
1216245 we came from about eight or so points behind to win
1216246 its a new day its a new state its a new election
1216247 then its on to kentucky oregon and the rest of the contest
1216248 i need media credentials out i need a space for her
1216249 its good to see there is life after the presidential campaign
1216250 i want the nearly 18 million americans who voted for me to be respected to be heard
1216251 it aint me it aint me i aint no fortunate one
1216252 are you ready for the next president of the united states
1216253 there are areas off our coasts that should be open to exploration and exploitation and i hope we can take the first step by lifting the moratoria
1216254 would be very helpful in the short term in resolving our energy crisis
1216255 actually according to all the polls we see that we have as large a percentage of the republican party that is supporting me as president bush had in 04 and 2000
1216256 im happy with the degree of unity that our party has well be fine over time it always takes time
1216257 i am convinced that we are on the path to victory
1216258 he wants to raise taxes i want to lower them
1216259 i worked with senator kennedy on immigration i worked with senator feingold on campaign finance reform i worked with senator dorgan in the investigation of the abramoff scandal
1216260 i wont tell them that in small towns across america and pennsylvania that they are bitter so therefore they embrace religion and the second amendment
1216261 i also feel that the people of california will probably make a decision on this
1216262 the people that contributed are supporters of mine not supporters of his
1216263 you know a lot of people arent going to like that
1216264 in the form of tangible financial rewards if the states decide to lift those moratoriums
1216265 to what extent is the lifting of the moratoria addressing that
1216266 and how do you persuade republicans that you are not in their face on what they think is an important part of a domestic energy plan
1216267 that this may be the last day that im ever involved in a campaign of this kind i thought i was out of politics until hillary decided to run but it has been one of the greatest honors of my life to be able to go around and campaign for her for president
1216268 my daughter has worked her heart out shes made over 400 appearances for her mother and just since march i stopped i didnt count back before then but in the 10 states and puerto rico weve campaigned in since march i have been in almost 300 separate communities
1216269 it hasnt helped hillary at all and it brought him down to normal status rather than superstar status
1216270 south dakota is traditionally republican to the max so to have the democratic nominee decided in south dakota is ironic
1216271 much of clintons behavior on the campaign trail this year has been so maladroit as to constitute malpractice his blowups at television reporters his derisive dismissal of obamas unwavering anti war stance as a fairy tale and most of all his denigrating comparison of obamas performance in the south carolina primary to jesse jacksons victories there two decades ago
1216272 arent you glad south dakota gets to finish the job
1216273 i dont want to be made a fool of so you call him and figure out if hes telling the truth
1216274 when buying a hard disk drive most users are only concerned with the drives capacity should you also care about performance we compared the performance of nine mainstream 250 gb sata 300 hard disk drive models from seagate samsung western digital maxtor and hitachi is there a big performance difference among them is it worthwhile to pay a little bit more and get a drive with a bigger buffer if so which is the fastest 250 gb in the market check it out
1216275 we here by announced that due to internal network failure todays trading session is halted until further notice
1216276 cuba a los 50 a os de la revoluci n
1216277 the whole regions transport network must establish a dense atmosphere of secure transport and production
1216278 make detailed and comprehensive arrangements for the stability and security of the transport system
1216279 with zoos you only have so much space available we dont have a strong hippopotamus program right now
1216280 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1216281 you think madison was guided by the experience and the expressions of the right in english law including the bill of rights of 1689
1216282 wasnt it the case that the banning of arms on the part of the scottish highlanders and of catholics in england used the term bear arms
1216283 blackstone describes it as a right to keep and bear arms under law and since he uses the words under law he clearly foresees reasonable regulation of that right
1216284 a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
1216285 wait a minute youre not saying that if somebody goes hunting deer he is bearing arms or are you
1216286 i would say that and so would madison and so would jefferson
1216287 while abstract explanations of fractions are often helpful and interesting to children they are not necessary for multiplying and dividing fractions for almost all children following the simple abstract rules for such operations is the best course the best way to justify the rules for multiplying and dividing fractioins is to say mathemeticians devised these rules because they work to make everything come out correctly there is no good way of explaining the meaning of multiplying and dividing fractions using objects or other concrete representatiions indeed i believe attempting such explanatiions will only confuse your child so i do not discuss them
1216288 abstract mathematical principles like the rules for multiplying fractions are not necessarily harder for people to understand than concrete real world examples
1216289 people first relate numbers to objects and operations to actiions
1216290 its like learning a second languagae once a person becomes fluent he or she need not translate every word of the new language into the native one since each word and phrase in the new language has taken on a meaning of its own indeed it would be slow and cumbersome to do so similarly after learning the language of math its most efficient and easier just to use the language mastering it through continued use
1216291 if obama was a white man he would not be in this position and if he was a woman of any color he would not be in this position he happens to be very lucky to be who he is and the country is caught up in the concept
1216292 gratuitous personal attacks aimed at unleashing the ugliest kind of forces in our society
1216293 it is part as i said of a growing and disturbing pattern
1216294 its my profound belief that over many decades no international partnership has served the world better than the special relationship between our two countries
1216295 the darkest days of the second world war when the strongest transatlantic partnership was forged
1216296 some people would suggest that the special relationship is a little less special than it was
1216297 weve got a great relationship our special relationship has been forged in common values and so our relationship is very special theres just such a uniqueness in the relationship
1216298 thats not to say you cant have other friends and we do but this is a unique relationship it truly is
1216299 i value my personal friendship as well as our relationship between our countries
1216300 look if it wasnt a personal relationship i wouldnt be inviting the man to a nice hamburger or something well done i might add
1216301 food riots in many countries the lowest supply of food for 30 years
1216302 unchecked the special groups pose the greatest long term threat to the viability of a democratic iraq
1216303 the special groups activities have in fact come out in greater relief during the violence of recent weeks
1216304 it is they who have the expertise to shoot rockets more accurately shoot mortars more accurately and to employ some of the more advanced material that have not just killed our soldiers and iraqi soldiers but also have been used to assassinate two southern governors in past months and two southern police chiefs
1216305 do you still view al qaeda in iraq as a major threat
1216306 commonwealth in which each individual group can make its voice heard
1216307 universal call to feed the hungry and comfort the sick and care for the infirm
1216308 we welcome you with the ancient words commended by saint augustine pax tecum
1216309 in a world where some invoke the name of god to justify acts of terror and murder and hate we need your message that god is love
1216310 in a world where some treat life as something to be debased and discarded we need your message that all human life is sacred in a world where some no longer believe that we can distinguish between simple right and wrong we need your message to reject this dictatorship of relativism in a world where some see freedom as simply the right to do as they wish we need your message that true liberty requires us to live our freedom not just for ourselves but in a spirit of mutual support
1216311 effective voice for the legitimate aspirations of all the worlds people
1216312 on this the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights the need for global solidarity is as urgent as ever if all people are to live in a way worthy of their dignity
1216313 there will be a yellow rope in the face of the next of kin
1216314 were not going to be able to hear a thing
1216315 i am sure the first question in each of your minds is my safety and i am happy to tell you that im safe and doing well
1216316 i know most of what you hear on the news about iraq is not usually good news and that so many are dying over here
1216317 that is true to an extent but it does not paint the total picture and violence is not everywhere throughout the country so please dont associate what you see on the news with all of iraq
1216318 snide and shallow self justification typical in memoirs of former officials
1216319 the cia and the intelligence community should not be shading intelligence
1216320 the first time i heard the idea it came from ambassador bremer when he was on his way to baghdad i didnt sign off one way or the other
1216321 pushed harder to get it onto general frankss radar screen to get it onto secretary rumsfelds radar screen
1216322 i dont believe i raised the troop level issue in that connection
1216323 the most serious analysis of the downside and risks of war was produced in the pentagon by rumsfeld and his top advisers not by colin powell rich armitage george tenet or other officials who are reputed to have been the voices of caution
1216324 it was a plan that my office drafted powell and armitage tried to delay president bush approved jay garner began to implement and l paul bremer buried
1216325 the people of the united states have paid an awful price
1216326 i still have a hard time seeing the big picture and what constitutes success
1216327 thats not just one side of the aisle with those kind of concerns many on this side of the aisle have that as well
1216328 im just wondering whether general petraeus you have any idea of why he made that statement
1216329 i knew that i would basically have to have sex for money
1216330 if it was asked of me id be willing to do it
1216331 a few times in offices one time in a shopping mall
1216332 we have an energy crisis to say the least and were just doing more of the same
1216333 i want to tell our citizens in every part of the nation that the national congress republicans and democrats alike showed a devotion to public welfare and a realization of the emergency and the necessity for speed that it is difficult to match in our history
1216334 theyve filibustered our attempt to do something about the housing industry
1216335 ladies and gentlemen in approximately 10 seconds the ed markey avatar is going to gavel this hearing
1216336 there are also several other avatars who have been invited to watch todays hearing
1216337 he looks like he is a bit younger and he probably appreciates that having come off a little basketball injury
1216338 maybe in our second life we will always make our three point shot and still run up and down the court like we did 20 years ago
1216339 mr chairman youre not the only one with an avatar
1216340 the real reason were here is so that you can get some pointers on how to get past the seventh level of the world of warcraft
1216341 i cant help but think of the phrase get a life
1216342 some might also think of congress as a virtual world
1216343 many think we have little connection to the real world we fly into and out of town so quickly that we might as well send avatars to the floor to vote in our stead
1216344 if somehow some way you as the distinguished chairman find the virtual world so enjoyable that you wish to remain in it for a while ill be glad to ease your conscience here
1216345 take some of your colleagues with you and ill be glad to run the subcommittee in your absence
1216346 any dichotomy drawn between the activities in the real world and that of the virtual world we believe is artificial at best
1216347 theres a very strong sense that you are kind of in a way becoming more of yourself
1216348 an avatar its either a hindu or a buddhist name for a god
1216349 i think the rest of the world has a clearer perception of who we are
1216350 hes kind of like me we both have run from behind and won
1216351 consistent with my commitment to the australian people we are changing the configuration of our involvement in iraq
1216352 im hoping that in our own country we get the same thing coming out of the election this fall
1216353 i always like to be in the presence of somebody who does what he says hes going to do
1216354 he never would have succeeded if he hadnt had a clear objective a vision for where he wanted to go and he was willing to withstand the slings and arrows of the political wars in order to get there
1216355 successes were seeing in iraq are undeniable yet some in washington still call for retreat
1216356 war critics can no longer credibly argue that were losing in iraq so they now argue the war costs too much
1216357 help expose the real cost of the war by shutting down the irs first thing in the morning and make a clear statement to stop funding war
1216358 that was the information that i had at the time those charges are completely unrelated to me i have said that that was a mistake the fact pattern remains unchanged
1216359 the clinton campaign has been true to its word in employing a kitchen sink strategy
1216360 its 3 a m and your children are safely asleep who do you want answering the phone
1216361 i led a bipartisan effort to improve outpatient facilities i passed legislation to get family members health care while theyre caring for injured troops ive introduced legislation to make sure each service member receives electronic copies of their medical and service records upon discharge

1216371 what is junior league and is this what you do what do you know
1216372 well hopefully you have nepotism on your side because you are going to have a terrible time with this attitude and by the way green events arent that much of a big deal anymore its what you do its industry standard if you do them correctly just like architecture the way of the future is now affordable at least to the people with means the ones you want to plan for
1216373 imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not a sense of humor to console him for what he is
1216374 if the world were merely seductive that would be easy if it were merely challenging that would be no problem but i arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world this makes it hard to plan the day
1216375 i was a very young player and got my first taste of the olympics in 2000 at sydney i played in athens in 2004 and now this is my home country and the highest special honor in 2008 enough i think why would i need to play in london in 2012
1216376 does yao ming really want to say goodbye to the china team
1216377 for china they have to understand that my loyalty to my country will never change but now i have another group of people in america that i need to take care of these people the chinese fans and american fans are not connected they do not understand how each other think i am the one who is connected i am in the middle that is the important goal of the olympics to bring different people together

1216402 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1216403 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1216404 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1216405 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused

1216411 yet when it comes to linguistic and cultural expertise few can compare to a native speaker defense officials say

1216426 trucking firms have enjoyed some heady gains in the past couple of weeks and many of them have stretched out to new peaks so why the strength first investors are clearly anticipating higher earnings now that gasoline prices are beginning to come down but that cant be the only reason we think its likely the market is looking ahead toward a faster than expected recovery in the economy or at least in shipping volumes in its recent quarterly report which beat expectations by 25 werners management noted that prices are firming up likely a result of decent demand and fewer trucks on the road analysts are estimating that werners bottom line will jump 29 next year but in a cyclical industry like trucking that could prove to be conservative if energy prices continue to decline
1216427 presents a vivid alarming profile of americas current financial status
1216428 the story of americas four key deficits budget savings balance of payments and leadership
1216429 suggestions for how best to recreate a fiscally sound nation for future generations
1216430 in the muslim school the teacher wrote to tell mother i made faces during koranic studies
1216431 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
1216432 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1216433 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1216434 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1216435 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1216436 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1216437 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1216438 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1216439 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1216440 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1216441 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1216442 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1216443 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1216444 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1216445 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1216446 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1216447 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1216448 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1216449 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1216450 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1216451 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1216452 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1216453 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1216454 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1216455 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
1216456 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
1216457 a young man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of this country
1216458 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1216459 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1216460 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1216461 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1216462 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1216463 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1216464 thats old uncle aunt insert name talking out of his her head again
1216465 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1216466 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1216467 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1216468 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1216469 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1216470 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1216471 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1216472 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1216473 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1216474 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1216475 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1216476 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1216477 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1216478 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1216479 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1216480 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1216481 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1216482 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1216483 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1216484 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
1216485 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
1216486 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
1216487 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
1216488 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
1216489 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1216490 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1216491 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1216492 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
1216493 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1216494 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1216495 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1216496 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
1216497 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
1216498 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1216499 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1216500 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1216501 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1216502 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1216503 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1216504 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1216505 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1216506 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1216507 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1216508 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
1216509 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1216510 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
1216511 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1216512 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1216513 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1216514 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1216515 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1216516 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1216517 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1216518 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1216519 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1216520 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1216521 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1216522 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
1216523 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate
1216524 on a global basis sea ice anomalies in may 2008 continue to be above the long term average during the 1979 2008 satellite period the 10th highest on record
1216525 sometimes all it takes is the help of a loving soul somebody who puts their arm around a troubled person and says i love you
1216526 they tend to think washington has the answers to our problems
1216527 they tend to believe our country only succeeds under the expansive federal government they tend to be suspicious of americas exercise of global leadership unless of course we get a permission slip from international organizations
1216528 it is time to stop talking it is time for them to stop acting
1216529 you and i know the american people are not undertaxed you and i succeeded in cutting taxes you and i believe in accountability you and i believe in the worth of every human being
1216530 we believe our nation has the right to defend itself we darn sure didnt seek the approval of groups like moveon org we challenged the critics the self proclaimed experts
1216531 the problem is washington spends too much of your money
1216532 without objection the chair is authorized to declare a recess
1216533 to roll our minds back to that terrible day of september 11th 2001 the day that all of us looked at that blazing inferno tumbling down in new york
1216534 i was going to go home and donate to him some more
1216535 im one of those people who when you tell me i cant do something thats when i decide im going to do that
1216536 he feels that an african american candidate wont be able to do what he needs to do in washington to get change done
1216537 i am absolutely convinced that the american people right now they dont care whether you are black white brown or green
1216538 if i came to you and i had polka dots but you were convinced that i was going to put more money in your pockets and help you pay for college and keep america safe youd say okay i wish he didnt have polka dots but im still voting for him
1216539 just for the record as i understand it there was an injury on mr clemenss buttocks
1216540 do you recall any bleeding through your pants in 2001
1216541 i did it the right way and i worked my butt off
1216542 what uniform you will wear to the hall of fame
1216543 a group of black lesbians who decided to gang assault
1216544 by this analysis we ought to recruit only lesbians for the military because they have the lowest incidence of hiv in the country
1216545 arent professional enough to serve openly with gay troops while successfully completing their military mission
1216546 what would you say to cynthia yost the woman on a training exercise assaulted by a group of lesbians
1216547 would you please tell me miss donnelly why i should give one twit about this womans sexual orientation when it didnt interfere one bit with her service
1216548 i am besieged by a thousand or more of the mexicans under santa anna i have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for 24 hours i am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country victory or death
1216549 i refuse to allow the establishment or the party bosses in washington or anywhere else to tell us this is over
1216550 for me to pull out of the election before texas gets to vote would not only be unacceptable it would be inexcusable
1216551 people sometimes think of the alamo as a defeat but it actually was the springboard to texass victory and independence
1216552 he needs to stick with it to the very end
1216553 next time i see him as president ill say remember the alamo
1216554 even when travis and the people of the alamo knew what might be an inevitable fate they did not flinch
1216555 and thats why i think that when we go to texas we go with a real sense of resolve and purpose and direction and you know a commitment to see it through
1216556 this time you know the alamo story may turn out differently
1216557 i am always inspired by the heroic story of this sacred place
1216558 we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy
1216559 you dont engage in your battles only because you anticipate that youre going to win them you engage in your battles because you believe theyre right
1216560 when youre doing the right thing the outcome is less important than it is that you put your every moment and every ounce of energy into it
1216561 will have made a statement to the rest of the nation that the election isnt over until texas says it is
1216562 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1216563 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1216564 someone told me the thing to do is i ought to be surrounded by beautiful women
1216565 iran contra or clinton or spotted owl or florida recount or sex or indict or enron or kerry or iraq or wmd or gay or homosexual or gun
1216566 i find it interesting that in a room of such esteemed journalists that mr drudge has become your respected assignment editor
1216567 i find it to be a reflection of one of the problems thats gone on with the overall coverage of this campaign
1216568 a point that has been certainly backed up by the saturday night live skit that opened the show this past saturday evening which i would refer you all to
1216569 we think we are on the verge of our next up cycle
1216570 for the love of god we cant say theres not much chance here
1216571 as we all know in this city i have a very short memory
1216572 the fact is he could not carry his weight in the general election
1216573 i think if we lose in texas and ohio mrs clinton will have to make her decisions as to whether she goes forward or not
1216574 i dont think any of our senior people have the esp skills that you all ascribe to us
1216575 as far as i can tell there was absolutely no follow up on the part of the obama traveling press corps
1216576 when shes the general election nominee shell release the tax returns
1216577 my mom made pancakes every single morning at our house
1216578 how do you address the perception building out there that this thing is getting away from you
1216579 can you explain how youre going to fight back whether or not youre willing to continue to invest your own money in your cause
1216580 i have authorized a seven figure i wont give you the exact number but a seven figure advertising buy for our campaign
1216581 but frankly at this stage i dont think anyone will be advertising on a per person basis the level we did in michigan and florida
1216582 some of us wish we had invested less early and could do more now
1216583 youre free to do with it what you want to you can spend it all
1216584 but the fact is that your negative ads my friend have set the tone unfortunately in this campaign
1216585 im not sure theres going to be much left after this
1216586 you said were all family and that youd include us in your inheritance
1216587 i dont think its possible to flood the airwaves in 22 states
1216588 im not going to answer a legal opinion on every imaginable set of facts any human being could think of
1216589 im not here to render legal advice to your committee
1216590 if you issue a subpoena well go through this again
1216591 are we headed toward or in danger of being in a recession
1216592 arent you underestimating not paying enough attention to the severity of the problem in the credit markets
1216593 its another to know exactly what to do about it
1216594 some would say that were a step slow i have no argument with that complaint
1216595 we are entirely staffed at the point we need to be staffed
1216596 will ohman braves reliever came over to the bar and said what was skips favorite drink in his drinking days
1216597 i said double dewars on the rocks and will ordered a shot of dewars for everybody
1216598 that was our tribute if you want to call it that
1216599 skip would not have liked that he would have called us soft
1216600 when you take a solemn stroll along that wall of black granite on the national mall its hard not to notice the many names such as rodriguez hernandez and lopez
1216601 was denied burial beside the men he fought with and bled with because of the color of his skin
1216602 my beloved friend everett alvarez a brave american of mexican descent had been shot down years before i was
1216603 arrested for crimes they didnt commit and thrown in jail by juries they couldnt serve on
1216604 hispanics lose their jobs faster than almost anybody else or work jobs that pay less and come with fewer benefits
1216605 we have 1 in 3 latinas who dont have health care
1216606 i was friends with hillary clinton before we started this campaign i will be friends with hillary clinton after this campaign is over
1216607 i respect senator clinton i think her service to this country has been extraordinary and im glad that weve been walking on this road together
1216608 will be particularly important if senator mccain is the nominee on the republican side we cant start off just with the same playing field and expect to win
1216609 many of the solutions that senator clinton just talked about are solutions that i agree with
1216610 senator clinton is right they will resist anything that we try to do my plan her plan
1216611 there were good things that happened during those eight years of the clinton administration
1216612 i certainly respect senator obama making his speech in 2002 against the war
1216613 si no hubiera recursos p blicos accesos a recursos p blicos ni a cr ditos la tarifa ser a de 600 pesos
1216614 i always have a certain discomfort level because of my past spectacular successes when i was in front
1216615 he cant stay the underdog all the way through the primaries
1216616 i walked in and there was this huge plastic jacuzzi right in the center of the room with the nozzles all moving
1216617 unfortunately they spent so much money on the jacuzzi they had done nothing on insulation and the guy next door watched television a good part of the evening
1216618 can you imagine my political fortunes today really if the surge had failed
1216619 we probably wouldnt be on this bus together id probably be on a greyhound back to phoenix
1216620 we had a choice between fernando dancing queen or take a chance on me
1216621 it is nice to slow down and actually see the surroundings
1216622 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1216623 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1216624 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1216625 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1216626 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1216627 you know its not about you its about your country
1216628 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1216629 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1216630 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
1216631 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
1216632 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
1216633 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance
1216634 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
1216635 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1216636 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1216637 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1216638 im gonna get me so of that reward and shut that mans pie hole up once and for all
1216639 i never heard a man moan so much about anything much less about global warming and the coming judgment day he done scared the hell out of my chickens now they dont lay as many eggs as before
1216640 when im done thinking up something that will finally shut that man up i just know my chickens will be laying like the used to
1216641 but for now theyll have to wear ear plugs you best get a pair too because its gonna be a long ten years of hearing that man talking without them
1216642 we will not back down we will not slow down we are in this for the long haul
1216643 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is so absurd
1216644 i salute him for that challenge it is absolutely possible to do so
1216645 i think nuclear will play a role i dont think it will be a large increase
1216646 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1216647 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1216648 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1216649 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1216650 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case
1216651 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
1216652 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
1216653 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
1216654 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1216655 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1216656 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
1216657 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
1216658 will attend a weekend meeting with irans chief nuclear negotiator the meeting is part of ongoing efforts to persuade iran to stop its nuclear program
1216659 abba and pierce brosnan thats the best movie i have seen in a long time
1216660 at john mccains campaign you cant spit without hitting a big money lobbyist who is raising money for or staffing his campaign mccainslobbyists com shows just how much mccain is embedded in and wedded to the old web of corruption in washington dc
1216661 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1216662 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1216663 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1216664 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well
1216665 inflation is intensifying and that is the main source of weakness in consumer spending
1216666 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1216667 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1216668 unlike obama in illinois sen hillary clinton voted to support the 2002 federal bill
1216669 in fact the bill passed the senate 98 to 0 with pro abortion senators like boxer d ca and reid d nv supporting it
1216670 deal hudson has been one of the leading proponents of this language thats very corrosive
1216671 his rhetoric has been corrosive for catholic values with these broadside attacks that are disingenuous and unethical the parallel would be to say mccain wants children to die of infectious diseases because he voted against s chip
1216672 hes a name on a list a volunteer when are we going to start talking about gas prices jobs and the issues facing americans the mccain campaign is all done with the gotcha games
1216673 the congress doing nothing decided to go on a five week recess said mccain
1216674 congress should come back into session and im willing to come off the campaign trail
1216675 these are trendsetters in image categories not necessarily in issues of sustainability
1216676 while they are motivated to help the cause and are striving to educate themselves they are far from experts our aim was to discover which companies are going beyond the niche segment of hard core greenies to win over influential gen ys
1216677 this retreat is going to be different im not sure if i will sense god personally but i certainly hope that i see him working in other people around me
1216678 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1216679 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1216680 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1216681 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1216682 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1216683 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1216684 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
1216685 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
1216686 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
1216687 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
1216688 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1216689 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
1216690 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
1216691 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
1216692 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1216693 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
1216694 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
1216695 browns hypocrisy is much closer to the classical sense of the term which involves not believing what you say
1216696 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
1216697 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
1216698 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
1216699 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1216700 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1216701 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
1216702 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
1216703 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
1216704 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1216705 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
1216706 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
1216707 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
1216708 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1216709 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1216710 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1216711 i really feel that the highest and best use of whatever talents i have in my life
1216712 im devoting my life trying to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines that supports the massive policy changes we need to have
1216713 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is so absurd as to not warrant a reply
1216714 we ought to make a commitment as a country to get 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy sources
1216715 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
1216716 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1216717 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
1216718 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1216719 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
1216720 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
1216721 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1216722 i know how to do this scene better than all of you because i am soooo cool and important and a great actor that everyone loves
1216723 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
1216724 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1216725 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
1216726 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country
1216727 a 90 percent chance that the us has contributed 2 degrees f of temperature increase in the last 50 years
1216728 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
1216729 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
1216730 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
1216731 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
1216732 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
1216733 ela s vai sair do carro quando o gr mio sair da lideran a ningu m segura o gr mio
1216734 se ela n o se matar eu vou l matar ela imagina andar duas quadras por causa dela
1216735 se ela quer se matar por que n o deixam ela que exagero
1216736 t gr vida agora que esse cara o suposto namorado que morava na pra a some de vez esse cara t longe
1216737 parece que a mulher de um gar om do bar stuart
1216738 enquanto ela n o se mata os bandidos est o soltos por a
1216739 se quiser se matar se mate mas atrapalhar o tr nsito
1216740 n o pode fica bem na frente da mulher a senhora n o quer ela atire na senhora n em qual pr dio que mesmo
1216741 tem uma psic tica com uma pistola num carro j efetuou v rios disparos t atirando em todo mundo que aparece
1216742 se uma pistola ela deve ter um monte de tiros quantas balas vai doze catorze
1216743 the fetus will reach up and wonder what this scope is
1216744 and even though his or her eyes are fused so they cant really see the scope theyll grab the scope sometimes because its an object in their cavity
1216745 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1216746 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
1216747 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
1216748 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
1216749 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1216750 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1216751 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1216752 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1216753 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1216754 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1216755 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1216756 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1216757 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1216758 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
1216759 gee i guess we ought to drive a bit less
1216760 we need more onramps and parking lots and big box stores to fuel our auto centric lifestyle and bring in more tax revenue
1216761 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1216762 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
1216763 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
1216764 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
1216765 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
1216766 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
1216767 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
1216768 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
1216769 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
1216770 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
1216771 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
1216772 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
1216773 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
1216774 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
1216775 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
1216776 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
1216777 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1216778 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
1216779 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
1216780 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
1216781 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
1216782 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
1216783 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
1216784 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
1216785 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
1216786 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
1216787 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1216788 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
1216789 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
1216790 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1216791 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
1216792 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
1216793 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
1216794 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
1216795 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
1216796 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
1216797 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
1216798 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
1216799 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
1216800 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
1216801 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
1216802 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1216803 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1216804 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
1216805 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
1216806 at john mccains campaign you cant spit without hitting a big money lobbyist who is raising money for or staffing his campaign mccainslobbyists com shows just how much mccain is embedded in and wedded to the old web of corruption in washington dc
1216807 to protect the interests and ensure the safety of all concerned
1216808 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1216809 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1216810 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well
1216811 inflation is intensifying and that is the main source of weakness in consumer spending
1216812 the timing of the united states ratification on the eve of the beijing olympic games is appropriate
1216813 the convention makes clear that the use of performance enhancing drugs to gain a competitive advantage undercuts the positive attributes of sport
1216814 unlike obama in illinois sen hillary clinton voted to support the 2002 federal bill
1216815 in fact the bill passed the senate 98 to 0 with pro abortion senators like boxer d ca and reid d nv supporting it
1216816 deal hudson has been one of the leading proponents of this language thats very corrosive
1216817 his rhetoric has been corrosive for catholic values with these broadside attacks that are disingenuous and unethical the parallel would be to say mccain wants children to die of infectious diseases because he voted against s chip
1216818 hes a name on a list a volunteer when are we going to start talking about gas prices jobs and the issues facing americans the mccain campaign is all done with the gotcha games
1216819 the congress doing nothing decided to go on a five week recess said mccain
1216820 congress should come back into session and im willing to come off the campaign trail
1216821 these are trendsetters in image categories not necessarily in issues of sustainability
1216822 while they are motivated to help the cause and are striving to educate themselves they are far from experts our aim was to discover which companies are going beyond the niche segment of hard core greenies to win over influential gen ys
1216823 what we think we ought to be doing is using our various forms of influence at this point in time to help a friend who we think has done something ill advised
1216824 the question is what do you do when someone makes a mistake that is a close ally
1216825 the presidents guidance to us is see if we can work with them to get back on track
1216826 thats going to depend heavily on what we hear obviously from the pakistani government
1216827 a real live example which ive been hearing a lot about from women there are many health insurance plans that will cover viagra but wont cover birth control medication those women would like a choice
1216828 ive been advocating on his behalf for about a year
1216829 ive spent the last three plus years getting involved in a variety of issues in a variety of government departments whether its the state department there are things that government can borrow and learn from business
1216830 one of the great things about my life right now is i have lots of options and lots of opportunities
1216831 and i have learned that if youre open to options and opportunities the future tends to take care of itself
1216832 as someone whos managed a lot of people one of the most important jobs you have is to put the right players on the field in the right positions
1216833 im a business person trends matter to me and the trendline for barack obama is down
1216834 i voluntarily gave up the contract that i was given when i arrived at hewlett packard so my pay could be put to a shareholder vote
1216835 like a start up company becoming a multimillion dollar corporation you have to add new skills and capabilities

1216918 there is still much we can and should be learning about that unique and precious woman who is our wife that gift from god to whom we have pledged our lifelong devotion there are two primary ways we can learn by studying her and by asking her questions if you have children living in the home then of all the questions you could ask her this one is especially revealing do you feel more like a mother or a wife

1216920 the kind of explanation which explains things away may give us something though at a heavy cost but you cannot go on explaining away for ever you will find that you have explained explanation itself away you cannot go on seeing through things for ever the whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it it is good that the window should be transparent because the street or garden beyond it is opaque how if you saw through the garden too it is no use trying to see through first principles if you see through everything then everything is transparent but a wholly transparent world is an invisible world to see through all things is the same as not to see

1216922 the bed is the heart of the home the arena of love the seedbed of life and the one constant point of meeting it is the place where night by night forgiveness and fair speech return that the sun may not go down on our wrath where the perfunctory kiss and the entirely ceremonial pat on the backside become unction and grace it is the oldest friendliest thing in anybodys marriage the first used and the last left and no one can praise it enough
1216923 mans conquest of nature turns out in the moment of its consummation to be natures conquest of man every victory we seemed to win has led us step by step to this conclusion all natures apparent reverses have been but tactical withdrawals we thought we were beating her back when she was luring us on what looked to us like hands held up in surrender was really the opening of arms to enfold us for ever

1216954 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1216955 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite
1216956 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1216957 the situation could well have been as bad as this say five years ago we just didnt know but now we have a much better indication of the state of the worlds primates and the news is not good
1216958 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change
1216959 the innovator attacks traditional values the tao in defence of what he at first supposes to be in some special sense rational or biological values but as we have seen all the values which he uses in attacking the tao and even claims to be substituting for it are themselves derived from the tao if he had really started from scratch from right outside the human tradition of value no jugglery could have advanced him an inch towards the conception that a man should die for the community or work for posterity if the tao falls all his own conceptions of value fall with it not one of them can claim any authority other than that of the tao only by such shreds of the tao as he has inherited is he enabled even to attack it the question therefore arises what title he has to select bits of it for acceptance and to reject others for if the bits he rejects have no authority neither have those he retains if what he retains is valid what he rejects is equally valid too

1216966 as doubts arise about the government media narrative it is becoming all too clear that ivins suicide likely brought about by the unrelenting pressure brought to bear on him over many months of constant harassment by the fbi rather than actual guilt is the occasion for the institutional whitewashing of the fbis almost unbelievable incompetence which seems more like a cover up as events unfold

1216971 this conjecture is surprising as no foreigner has any access to pakistan s nuclear designs it is not understood how anyone could reach such a conclusion
1216972 the entire story raised a number of questions if tinners files have relevance to dr a q khan then why were they destroyed the files should have been shared with pakistan if they were genuine and relevant to dr a q khan
1216973 pakistan is currently outraged by the death of 11 of its soldiers as a result of a us bombardment last week but it was precisely because khan had covered an early us bombing on pakistani soil that he was kidnapped tortured and killed
1216974 the previous government deliberately refused to shed light on the abduction and murder of this journalist who knew too much but the new authorities in islamabad and peshawar have a duty to identify and punish those responsible whoever they were we call for justice to be done
1216975 i want the government to protect hayatullahs children who are afraid of being the victims of a new attack after their mother was killed in a bombing

1216978 i want the government to protect hayatullahs children who are afraid of being the victims of a new attack after their mother was killed in a bombing
1216979 mans conquest of nature if the dreams of some scientific planners are realized means the rule of a few hundreds of men over billions upon billions of men there neither is nor can be any simple increase of power on mans side each new power won by man is a power over man as well each advance leaves him weaker as well as stronger in every victory besides being the general who triumphs he is also the prisoner who follows the triumphal car i am not yet considering whether the total result of such ambivalent victories is a good thing or a bad i am only making clear what mans conquest of nature really means and especially that final stage in the conquest which perhaps is not far off the final stage is come when man by eugenics by pre natal conditioning and by an education and propaganda based on a perfect applied psychology has obtained full control over himself human nature will be the last part of nature to surrender to man the battle will then be won we shall have taken the thread of life out of the hand of clotho and be henceforth free to make our species whatever we wish it to be the battle will indeed be won but who precisely will have won it for the power of man to make himself what he pleases means as we have seen the power of some men to make other men what they please
1216980 the human mind has no more power of inventing a new value than of imagining a new primary colour or indeed of creating a new sun and a new sky for it to move in
1216981 as a measure of our tangible display to seek peace with our neighbours we have decided to freeze actually reduce the defence budget when seen in the context of inflation and the rupee dollar parity
1216982 we hope to see a reciprocal gesture from our neighbour for the sake of peace and prosperity of the region
1216983 we live and operate in a volatile environment we cannot therefore afford to remain oblivious to our defence needs
1216984 i wish to categorically state that pakistan stands for peace with honour we shall continue to strive for it without compromising on our national interests
1216985 as a matter of policy i declare that our defence is based on the strategy of minimum essential credible deterrence and that we shall not enter into any arms race

1217147 i make my living as a white anti racist let me just lay my cards on the table to say that because its true and well i suppose that some people might find that problematic but the alternative is that i do some other job to survive receive white privilege anyway doing that and only get to do anti racism in my spare time so i have to ask would the struggle against racism be better off if i did that well i can pretend humility for a moment and say im not sure but the reality is the answer is no it would not be better off there are thousands of white people every year who i reach through paid speaking gigs as a white anti racist of course if i believed that me not getting the resources would mean that anti racist people of color would get the resources i would of course not take the money what kind of person do you think i am but the truth is that the institutions that pay me would never think to give money to anti racist people of color right off the bat so the story i tell is the situation actually is that i am coming in to open up the place so that people of color can follow me later because really if i didnt come in and make change with my white anti racist message first people of color would not have an ice cubes chance in hell of being paid by that institution to do anti racist work so me getting paid means its more likely that people of color will be able to follow me in the future after i cash the check of course whats good for me is in fact good for people of color the more resources that come to me the more resources become available to antiracist people of color really i promise

1217161 as is the natural order of things we all under our skin under our skin i think is a real nice phrase are ferocious primates justice which is desirable is only obtained by a balance of self interest given that we non whites oppose white racism not because of any moral compass informed by justice but based on our immediate self interest alone our self interest if left unchecked could very well precipitate an inversion of the system of white supremacy into a system of non white supremacy which of course would be unjust on the other hand white anti racists are abandoning their white privilege against their immediate self interest and are thus in so far clearly more compassionate and morally superior to non whites because if they were not it follows that they would just retain their white privilege that is not be white anti racists

1217167 we will always struggle with our whiteness and our white privilege and sometimes we will make mistakes that support racism
1217168 we understand that as white anti racists we will never be perfect but with gentle yet pointed critique and critical reflection on our practice we can continue to refine our effectiveness as anti racist allies

1217340 we have shifted from having a spirit of national solidarity to one of individualism
1217341 it used to be inconceivable that a student would leave for abroad and not return to apply their skills to serve their country but that is no longer the case
1217342 of the 75 students in my year at medical school about fifty went abroad to pursue their studies and specialise and none of them then returned they are all practicing in europe or america now
1217343 cameroonian universities produce up to 5 000 graduates per year and many of them will be unable to find employment commensurate with their training

1217345 here there is small elite that has been in power for over 20 years and it blocks everything i wanted to become a policeman but here if you have no money or connections your application will be rejected

1217348 the glory of god is the human being fully alive
1217349 i myself did not know him but i came baptizing with water for this reason that he might be revealed to israel
1217350 the next day john again was standing with two of his disciples and as he watched jesus walk by he exclaimed look here is the lamb of god the two disciples heard him say this and they followed jesus
1217351 the last three years of his life offered no honors or victories only declining acclaim and developing despair
1217352 i have labored in vain i have spent my strength for nothing and vanity yet surely my cause is with the lord and my reward with my god
1217353 we shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice
1217354 the day of yom kippur came and all day the rabbi had fasted done penance and prayed for his people his small congregation
1217355 have tam offer your prayers to me and i will graciously accept all of you back into my heart forgiving all things and showing my mercy upon you
1217356 i have been praying for mercy and forgiveness for all of us on this night and i have been clearly told by god blessed be hi name that we all will be forgiven and taken back into the heart of god if you pray for us if you give your prayer to god on our behalf
1217357 o holy one you know i am not good at praying but i bring you all i have
1217358 god has heard of tam and we are forgiven we are once again the people of god let us live this year with grateful hearts
1217359 so jim you really think that because im not a christian im going to hell
1217360 behold the lamb of god which takest away the sin of the world
1217361 lamb of god who takes away the sins of the world have mercy on us
1217362 sin is the seeking of our own will instead of the will of god thus distorting our relationship with god with other people and with all creation
1217363 but the judgment of god is upon the church as never before
1217364 i hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour

1217367 we strive for ways to tell a story that will interest an audience
1217368 i ask them to take a look at the world in which they live and the culture that they inhabit i want them to see their own environment with fresh eyes
1217369 karens piece has this style that isnt imitative it is so uniquely hers
1217370 karen was very excited by the work of a chinese filmmaker named wong kar wai she showed me a music video he made and told me i want that contrast and i want that rich color so we spent time talking what we would have to do to create that look in production and editing
1217371 she even chose her locations because of color and light and then i helped her use filters and tools to manipulate color and contrast so that all of the shots matched
1217372 there is an artistic understanding that is coming from the adult
1217373 kens ikeda philosophy is to bring in artists who are working in the field there is a deep commitment to having professional artists working with youth
1217374 much of what i do is draw on my own experience to anticipate potential problems
1217375 during karens production process boswell helped her cultivate the tools she needed for directing actors something he has a strong background in doing using one powerful technique boswell asked karen to go through her screen play line by line and write down an action verb to describe what the characters are physically doing and emotionally experiencing as the dialogue is spoken
1217376 we dont want it to be about the adult taking control it is a delicate balance
1217377 needless to say we didnt go all that was on my mind initially was to get back home to see if my family and friends in new york were safe
1217378 it was literally as the bombs were dropping we were in editorial discussions and we realized that it would be young people who would be serving and soon they would be coming home we wanted to learn how that experience was affecting them and how they were adjusting to their new or prior lives
1217379 certainly this is a war that is of this generation and we need to be hearing directly from them
1217380 we were primarily hearing from the high level military spokespeople
1217381 it was clear that we werent hearing enough from young people on the ground
1217382 what do you do in that church of yours during the week
1217383 prayer for dummies a crash course on prayer amp meditation
1217384 installation art creates a very active and alive space that inspires dialogue especially when placed inside an artists environment and community people respond to the work because they sense the urgency passion and creative pulse behind it
1217385 installation art fosters engagement with an audience that cant be replicated by broadcast or other dissemination approaches it lets young people speak out about their daily lives in their own neighborhoods to the people they live with and care about
1217386 they are exposed to video photography graphic design digital audio performance installation social research contemporary art history and aesthetics in a college preparatory approach
1217387 yet all of this is done through an individualized and highly rigorous art process
1217388 the program actually takes several months to plan execute and assess
1217389 its challenging but that is what makes it so valuable for the youth and for the audiences that come to the show
1217390 they are going to be putting themselves out there in front of a public so we set very high standards and expectations from the beginning
1217391 they participate in two formal critiques in which they must answer tough questions and articulate what they are doing and why
1217392 standards are high but no one is allowed to fall between the cracks
1217393 through the process of making art we help them look at problems differently that is when they begin to realize their own potential
1217394 at the end of the month about a quarter of the cars are just parked on the streets because no one has the money to buy fuel
1217395 they have started to mix in kerosene it damages the engines
1217396 i earn well but still it is only 150 000 francs about 353 a month
1217397 is cameroon anglophone literature non existent or is there a thriving literary community in the former british southern cameroons which is simply not known on the national and international scene this blog will try to answer this question by profiling novelists poets and playwrights from that former british trust territory most of whose works are not available out of cameroon and have only limited distribution within cameroon the blog will also focus on the emerging third generation anglophone writers in the diaspora who are part of what is increasingly being referred to as the anglophone cameroon literary renaissance
1217398 if you had seen what i had seen you would not take that road
1217399 it is impossible absolutely impossible you must stay where you are
1217400 you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave
1217401 if you see people throwing stones it means if they had guns they would have been shooting
1217402 the youth are paired with an artist mentor who helps guide them through the various stages of the art process
1217403 we show them skills and equipment but we dont tell them what direction their art should take
1217404 when you are creating art you are making a piece of yourself tactile
1217405 and you are giving a piece of yourself to the public as well so you must take ownership of it and you must pay attention to what you are doing
1217406 when youth are given opportunities to examine themselves through the art process they are actually gaining survival skills as well as artistic ability
1217407 they are learning to see themselves as individuals capable of facing challenges thinking for themselves solving problems and asserting their own identities
1217408 there are so many different learning styles but many schools fail to challenge all students when they only test and reward one type of intelligence
1217409 each youth responds differently to various learning contexts you cant give them all one formula and expect them to learn the same way
1217410 lectures skill trainings experiential learning field trips mentors discussions lab time individual projects group projects and self guided research
1217411 for most adolescent youth in our programs they dont really understand something until they experience it themselves
1217412 by having multiple teachers and learning environments they became less stuck on me and my co teacher
1217413 i could step back and the class would run itself because they were in charge of their own learning
1217414 saap isnt really about teaching youth conventional documentary or narrative filmmaking techniques our belief is that when you present formulaic ways of creating media you are putting the youth inside of a box
1217415 for instance we discussed the theme of political protest by looking at how artists throughout history and across various media approach the same subject in very different ways
1217416 we want them to develop their ideas into a personal and innovative style especially since we are working with a whole new generation of youth who have their own tools and technologies
1217417 youth are surrounded by these mass media images and icons so they can get caught up in the act of emulation and forget about their own personal voice therefore our mission is to help them discover themselves through an art work
1217418 we give them the box but leave the top off and then at their own pace they can build the ladder to get themselves out
1217419 you wont get anything done unless you make certain that everyone feels completely safe and comfortable
1217420 games are important ways you build trust and establish avenues for communication
1217421 but it cant just be about the youth respecting each others differences you as a facilitator have to earn their respect too it has to be reciprocal
1217422 when i am giving a lecture i am in front
1217423 and they know that in that particular moment i am more of the teacher but at the end of each day when we do reflections i let them know what i learned from them as well there are too many things in the world to know about you cant know possibly know everything so we all teach each other
1217424 it is much more like college they have to write take notes during lectures participate in discussions lead critiques and cite references and evidence for their arguments
1217425 at the same time you dont really understand something unless you work at it you need both a safe space and high standards in order to succeed
1217426 it is well known that anyone can make art marcel duchamp signed a toilet and told us that but that isnt what its about what makes something art is when it inspires people to think in a new way
1217427 know what they are saying but they have a clever way of saying it
1217428 at street level we always want our youth to have the freedom to explore topics that are of personal interest to them
1217429 so we had to think long and hard about whether a theme based approach was the right move to make
1217430 much of the work suffered from lack of depth and focus
1217431 they were so overwhelmed by choices that they didnt know where to begin
1217432 so we believed that an issue based theme might not only help youth create a group learning experience for themselves but also create a larger group impact on the audience
1217433 but they came around to it quickly when they learned how directly their own lives are connected to these issues
1217434 everyone absorbed strands of what was covered in the workshops and took it in their own direction in fact the thematic based inquiry approach dramatically increased the positive impact of saap on multiple levels including the following
1217435 we wanted them to come away with a more developed critical consciousness and the use of a thematic based inquiry approach allowed us to zero in on a few big ideas that we felt were really important for urban youth artists to know
1217436 in the beginning no one could respond to any of these questions but each day they began to make new connections and epiphanies
1217437 it is a more contextual and scaffolded process of learning
1217438 what are the five freedoms guaranteed in the first amendment and why are they important
1217439 when and why has art been censored by the government
1217440 it really helped focus how i planned the entire eight weeks
1217441 it also makes you more aware and in the moment as a facilitator each day because you know what kind of understandings you want the youth to develop and you can direct their energy towards this goal
1217442 even though they are making individual works of art they really are reaching these new understandings with and through one another
1217443 more aware and knowledgeable of how the first amendment relates to youth and or their communities
1217444 one of the major merits of this book is to provide us with a deeper insight into the role of those actors who have never been the subject of plebiscite studies namely the plebiscite supervisory officers
1217445 you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations
1217446 tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another
1217447 tonight i can stand before you and say that i will be the democratic nominee for president of the united states
1217448 and you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal healthcare in this country and we will win that fight she will be central to that victory
1217449 our party and our country are better off because of her and i am a better candidate for having had the honour to compete with hillary rodham clinton
1217450 it has been an honour to contest the primaries with him just as it has been an honour to call him my friend
1217451 this has been a long campaign and i will be making no decisions tonight
1217452 i want the 18 million americans who voted for me to be respected
1217453 now is the time for us to unite so that real change is possible in november
1217454 the american people didnt get to know me yesterday as they are just getting to know senator obama
1217455 bill will be the unexpected roommate even if a president obama can discipline hillary and get her to play second fiddle there is not the remotest chance that he can get the former president to accept such rules
1217456 let me be clear israels security is sacrosanct it is non negotiable
1217457 the palestinians need a state that is contiguous and cohesive and that allows them to prosper but any agreement with the palestinian people must preserve israels identity as a jewish state with secure recognized and defensible borders jerusalem will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
1217458 cia sponsored civil wars in liberia sierra leone mozambique angola etc are nightmares of the vestiges of the us policies in africa the african sees in obama a new brand of american politics that will see africa as vital partner and not as a golgotha
1217459 i am asking you to believe not just in my ability to bring real change in washington i am asking you to believe in yours
1217460 early on we support them even if they want to produce genre pieces but as they advance in the program we ask them to consider social issues more and more we start probing them to think about impact on audience and what they want to express and why
1217461 with karen we talked through a lot of different issues that came up in the process and worked together to think through and resolve those problems
1217462 the production process is partly determined by the genre and style that the youth choose to work in
1217463 some want to have a full production crew so they only have to concentrate on directing others like karen want to be involved in all aspects of the production process karen was intentionally focused on achieving a diy style so she performed in directed shot and edited her piece
1217464 each participant is responsible for asking for what they need
1217465 i showed her how to light and frame the shots in production and use color correction filters in post production based completely on the visual style that she envisioned
1217466 if i am setting up green screen or a three point lighting situation then everyone is invited to learn as a group
1217467 we always have the youth and what they want to learn foremost in mind so if there is an artist out there who can provide the guidance or information they need we try to make that person available to our participants
1217468 providing ample time to explore and learn at their own pace is absolutely key to the success of these youth and this program
1217469 many teenagers have not fully developed their time management skills
1217470 it takes time and practice and long periods of critique evaluation multiple drafts and recuts with a large dose of critical feedback to succeed
1217471 it is often a tedious undertaking but there is very little resistance to it pacing and
1217472 a big part of this program is to empower the filmmakers and make them feel as if they have a place and a voice that is outside of the confines of their neighborhood or their city
1217473 critiques pitch sessions peer reviews and self reflections are built into the regular process and the youth genuinely appreciate that
1217474 karen applied to her dream list of universities with slip of the tongue and she was accepted into every single one including nyu
1217475 global kids sees a value in having youth translate a body of knowledge into the activities and iconography of games here students are encouraged to think of alternative ways of modeling knowledge and learn to use the vocabulary of game design to represent central aspects of the world around them
1217476 is one of the best political web games released this year unlike most games with a political message it actually has a strategy that works ayiti manages to deliver a strong political message without sacrificing strategy or entertainment balancing real life information with gaming conventions superbly well
1217477 1973 simona voc ta ficando velha o que diz a musica sera uma indireta pra mim ah n o gosto

1217479 i was part of the generation that overnight in 1995 went from being called slackers to being considered entrepreneurs
1217480 we were seeing this phenomenon where teens in our workshops would learn about child soldiers in the congo but then go home to play games in which they were in the role of soldiers we wondered what does this mean that they are playing games that dont reflect their values something was clearly going on here
1217481 it seemed to be a good fit for several reasons
1217482 that is what it means to be a global kids youth leader you research them design them and conduct them for other teens and for adults as well
1217483 we didnt know if it was possible we had done it with video with radio but could we do it with games
1217484 we thought that we should get some real game designers in here and make this happen so in the spring of 2003 we secured funding from the surdna foundation and started meeting regularly with gamelab to design a curricular model
1217485 n o permita que ningu m te fa a sentir inferior
1217486 as a doctor it was amazing to see this previously unrecorded disease slowly become deciphered
1217487 buruli ulcers have been reported in more than 30 countries according to the world health organization with the increasing geographical spread since 1980 who is working to improve surveillance and develop better tools to control the disease karen introduced me to traditional healers who knew all about placing a hex on someone and even how to cure the disease with herbs and a piece of bark
1217488 our program is unique in that we emphasize the product as well as the process
1217489 some of the early works are among the best he definitely proved that this model could work
1217490 we emphasize creative and political expression through a strong visual style
1217491 the factory is designed for youth who have not only had previous experience but come prepared with a sense of passion and urgency around making media and telling their own stories
1217492 we are looking for youth who are highly motivated enthusiastic and committed
1217493 there is a pedagogical argument to be made for bringing a diverse mix of youth into this collective learning space
1217494 i was asked to participate in a filmmakers conference in connecticut in may 2005 in order to go i had to produce a one minute psa that incorporated the theme of how youth are making a difference being a lover of spoken word i wrote out a vague treatment about how many youth utilize poetry to change the world through self expression
1217495 by my friend adriel luis stood out to me since it actually told a story and was structured just like a film with an introduction conflict climax and resolution and so after 2 weeks i finished my 1 minute psa and eventually i turned it into a complete four minute short
1217496 it was everywhere people were talking about it on myspace and facebook karen was winning one award after another in fact youth are still flocking to us wanting to participate in our program in hopes they can make something equally as powerful
1217497 we would take their curriculum and recreate it by putting it through a youth development model for example they wanted the kids to learn about the roles in professional game design but the way they would do that was to list the roles on the board and lecture about them so what we would do instead is distribute the roles on unique playing cards and pass them out each with their own job description and assignment then we let it play out as if the whole group was a company and the workshop facilitators were the clients the youth participants were given a complex task that required dynamic interaction and understanding of their role in the process of game design
1217498 we dont just say we are going to teach you about discrimination what we do is use theatre and gaming activities in an experiential way to help youth learn about privilege and inequality
1217499 ultimately we move the discussion in a different direction by connecting the problems that exist to the actions that communities ngos and young people have taken to remedy situations which deny some children their basic human rights
1217500 when they decided that they wanted to do something about global education and poverty they are making that decision based on an understanding of world agreements about human rights
1217501 many of these youth had parents and grandparents who could offer first hand accounts of life in haiti
1217502 we talked about how many people were in the family and what their hopes and dreams were
1217503 the kids began to push gamelab in different ways one time they said not everything is depressing in haiti so gamelab worked to incorporate positive aspects of life in haiti such as soccer games community development projects and cultural groups
1217504 they werent going to do the coding and programming we knew that right off the bat but they could draw on the skills and knowledge of game design to help them think critically about how the game worked and how players experienced it
1217505 we consider games to be a form of youth media
1217506 and the goal is to put their voice out through a game therefore the game has to work it has to be solid interesting and engaging so that people want to play it
1217507 the biggest design challenge with ayiti was creating a game that realistically and sensitively illuminated the challenges posed by poverty in daily life but that was still truly enjoyable and satisfying to play
1217508 we want them to identify themselves as leaders who have a critical perspective on the issues they care about so we have very high expectations whether they are presenting a workshop at the un or producing a game that goes out in the world
1217509 at the bottom of the barrel and having nothing worth contributing
1217510 most of the kids come to the program at first because they are getting pizza or they think someones cute but then they stay because we respect them and their voices are getting heard
1217511 it completely overturns the way that conventional standards based education limits teachers
1217512 our programs are based on the premise that youth choose to be there we have full freedom because we are not grading them or judging them under the strictures of high stakes testing and no child left behind we are allowed to treat them differently and as a result these intergenerational relationships can be based on respect rather than fear obligation and punishment
1217513 a lot of people think at first that a curriculum around gaming is about teaching technical skills but it is much more than that
1217514 at the end the process looks very much like one where the youth themselves have become the trainers that is not what schools usually do
1217515 now i know what it feels like to be you a trainer
1217516 its really hard to do many things at a time
1217517 upgrade for 25 a year if you want more room and more extras kinda set me back but the standard acct is free

1217524 none so deaf as will not hear none so blind as will not see
1217525 apparently history is written by the same people who come up with urban legends
1217526 our role is to offer commentary and criticism from a fresh outside perspective
1217527 all countries are open for criticism the question that really needs to be asked is whether anyone should take what we write seriously for the most part the answer to that would be no
1217528 besides generalizations are kind of fun nationalistically hysterical koreans pot smoking over sexed english teachers condescending expats who doesnt love em its all a question of how seriously you take what you read
1217529 the fact that were foreigners shouldnt disqualify us i look at american social commentary and social criticism and some of our sharpest and best social critics have been foreigners people coming from a foreign perspective
1217530 why would i put all this effort why would i even care or put myself out there why would i do this if i didnt actually give a expletive
1217531 i find the notion that only koreans are permitted to speak about korean problems simply absurd
1217532 that isnt to say that all foreigners opinions on them are equally valid but if the roles were reversed then id be quite happy to hear the opinions of say a korean person who had spent some time in new zealand and who made an active effort to study and know new zealand society and learn the language
1217533 the majority of netizens aside ive actually found a significant number of koreans to feel much the same way about the opinions of non koreans
1217534 koreans are not unique in readily dismissing the opinions of foreigners but they do seem more defensive about foreign criticism than most for that reason it is very important to use korean sources as much as possible
1217535 without any korean ability foreigners are usually forced to rely on either the limited english language media or books for the bulk of their information and both have problems the former for often presenting a rose tinted version of korea to the world and the latter for being quickly out of date in a country as rapidly changing as korea
1217536 many complaints from expats that the korean has seen show a certain level of ignorance
1217537 expats rarely venture out of large cities in korea and they only really interact with koreans who are fluent in english do you know what makes a korean fluent in english money tons and tons of it so not only are expats insulated from older koreans they are also insulated from younger koreans who are poorer what kind of understanding about korea could an expat possibly have with this kind of limited exposure
1217538 naming a problem is the first step to solving it and maybe some of these critics are attempting to be a legitimate part of that process that is theyre writing because they want to see korea become a better place in which case koreans who are upset about non koreans criticizing korea need to stop and take a careful look at why that upsets them because the problem does not lie in the complainers or their intentions
1217539 to be fair sometimes the social critics intentions are good but their methods are poor the sometimes bitter and mean tone of certain critics can be hurtful and as ive said to some of my friends who complain about korea with a rude or condescending tone when you talk so harshly even when youre right youre wrong and even if you win the argument you still lose
1217540 ive also had to question how welcome those opinions are
1217541 but i think foreigners do have a right to speak about problems in korea and to address sensitive issues from our own perspectives
1217542 moreover these issues are so prickly because theyre not black and white while it might be unpleasant for some koreans to hear the other side of the story i dont think its inappropriate for it to be raised
1217543 our opinions are often dismissed with a line about you dont understand korean culture
1217544 i realize that a greater measure of tact is necessary when addressing sensitive issues and when trying to foster conversations across cultural boundaries but even with a lot of coddling i remain cynical that people are ready to hear what we have to say just yet
1217545 i would love to have koreans who disagree with me take the time to point out their objections rather than simply railing against a foreigner who dares to publish something against the grain and i would love to have koreans spend more time trying to educate us about their culture and their views then since so much energy is spent telling us how wrong and misinformed our opinions are
1217546 we didnt have any barbecue sauce so i got some catchup and mustard

1217567 we always complain about the departure of our athletes to more prestigious federations therefore i didnt hesitate at the opportunity of bringing a european athlete to cameroon thankfully my country backed me
1217568 it is one thing for the government to turn a blind eye on the fact that practically every player on the cameroonian football national team has dual nationality while at the same time making life difficult for less prominent cameroonians in the same situation it is however a different ball game when that same government grants cameroonian citizenship to someone who has not given up her hungarian citizenship and doesnt intend to while demanding that native born cameroonians give up their cameroonian passports when they become citizens of other countries
1217569 cameroonian athletes sprinters boxers etc who are competing under foreign flags in australia canada france etc who benefitted from the fast track clause
1217570 we will hit those points in a few years and that will help in many ways

1217588 initially we provided school supplies for the younger students only
1217589 last year a large donation from kids r kids allowed us to also provide school supplies at the junior high and high school

1217623 in a reversal barack obama is proposing tapping the nations strategic oil reserves to help drive down gasoline prices his campaign said monday
1217624 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency you have a situation lets say where there was a major oil facility in saudi arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market we wouldnt just be seeing 4 a gallon oil we could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all and thats what the strategic oil reserve has to be for
1217625 ever since we launched newwest net back in 2005 our community has been asking us for a print magazine
1217626 the new west with its tight focus on the big story of growth and development in the region is a logical complement to both newwest net and our growing conference series

1217855 the big benefit is that developers always work more efficiently and productively when they are able to communicate freely with each other
1217856 the mac community has a lot of resources for sharing advice about the mac development sdk and wed like to start establishing the same kinds of resources for the iphone sdk
1217857 i dont know of any successful platform that developers cant actually talk about online
1217858 i dont really want to spend my time toiling over a ton of issues that could easily be answered via a mailing list or blog post
1217859 i know there are a few developers that have written excellent pieces of code or blog posts that theyd love to share but the nda prevents it to me thats a no win for everyone
1217860 free flow of ideas help lists and web sites where newcomers to the platform can get help getting around common pitfalls
1217861 my publisher has advance orders they have commitments they are trying to deal with apple and as far as they knew the nda was supposed to be lifted july 11 thats what the people inside apple believed
1217862 but i do find the nda a troublesome agreement it made sense during the beta period but now it just doesnt
1217863 corporations are best served to have their technical support assisted by willing and knowledgeable volunteers
1217864 there is a cost associated with enforcing the nda in that apple is forced to do all the support themselves
1217865 has been like no other experience ive had with computers
1217866 a confidentiality nondisclose agreement is going to be enforced based on its reasonableness you could challenge the reasonableness of the exclusive right to speak about a wildly publicized consumer product but you are going to be dealing with some pretty savvy attorneys
1217867 if you agreed to the contract you agreed to its terms
1217868 im not sure whether it would force a clarification from apple or whether it would just go quietly
1217869 apple might pick out the ringleaders and make an example out of them
1217870 they could definitely take action against a select few to make a statement
1217871 im not one to try and test the waters ill let the wordpress guys do it
1217872 i didnt really think itd spread outside of the little twitter following but i think the nda issue is starting to spread a bit further
1217873 im not sure if apple has a specific reason for not lifting it or if theyre just being extra cautious with their new platform or if its just bureaucratic inertia
1217874 once the nda is lifted assuming they all forget about how dumb this whole thing was
1217875 the important thing is that apples developers also have a lot of really positive things to say about apple i think its comparable to the mini fiascos regarding the iphone launch and mobileme are customers going to hold a long term resentment against apple because of some snags along the way not when the end product is as great as it is

1217945 when i say that i could not in all good conscience allow myself to be influenced in any one direction i feel that i and all the members of the open council have been given a sacred trust i am duty bound to vote for the man who seems to me to be the very finest candidate from the many excellent men available
1217946 i must congratulate you on a noble stand lord ingelstad if everyone had your character we would be living in a better world a noble stand indeed especially when you have so much to lose no less than everything i suppose

1217969 unlikely that oaf marshal burr has spent three months squatting outside dunbrec and given bethod ample time to regroup beyond the whiteflow who knows when hell finally get the job done if ever

1218047 we have initialed the text of the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain last july 27 2008 the pact is a done deal it is binding on the contracting parties who are obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of their agreement
1218048 done with a credible third party witness the malaysian government as facilitator of the talks since 2001
1218049 the act of initialing the moa ad agreed text between the parties constitutes a signature of the philippine government and milf
1218050 this is not even a setback to the milf we are on the upper hand especially in the battle for moral ascendancy
1218051 it is the arroyo administration which is shamed in the eyes of the international community there are so many ambassadors already in the malaysian capital to attend the signing ceremony only to be told that it is canceled at the last minute
1218052 i think if a bar owner wants to allow smoking in his bar he should be allowed

1218055 the army is not allowed to use arms at all
1218056 i had no idea this would happen four years ago
1218057 she really got in my face and harped on lifestyle and said this is what you need to do to become what you want
1218058 she really changed a lot for me she started having me do tempo runs and really attacked the mental aspect of the sport and changed a lot of who i am today
1218059 i sucked four years ago so to see how far ive come it feels really really good
1218060 i have never felt such kind of pressure before its an olympics on home soil and i know its the best platform to prove yourself
1218061 i will not push myself too much the higher target you set the worse result you might get
1218062 three weeks ago i got bitten by a spider and had to be rushed into emergency
1218063 i couldnt walk on my foot for two days it was poisonous and i had a really bad fever that night i woke up and couldnt stand on the foot by the morning it was like a balloon and i had a red line all the way up the inside of my leg
1218064 my aim is to win the race i wouldnt be here if i didnt think i was in good enough shape
1218065 just been one nightmare after another when each one comes it hits you like a punch in the stomach and youre down on the floor but fighting it gives you a bit of energy as well
1218066 having won it and the time that i had a personal best 1 44
1218067 it gave me so much confidence that i deserve a medal in beijing
1218068 im not writing off the prelims but its a race i should be able to handle any day of the week the semis thats the one where youre racing three or four guys who all belong in the finals its who brings it that day so if i can make the finals i like my shot just as much as anybody for getting a medal
1218069 he calls me pup and i think thats so appropriate so accurate
1218070 times have changed its all very businesslike we dont really have that thing where this group doesnt like that group theres really no need to talk a lot
1218071 the girls are very even tempered and smooth i like everybody i dont have anyone where i say really mean things about i dont have that fierce feeling toward anyone
1218072 its just a new generation were kind of laid back its nice
1218073 we always tried to stress character with her and she seems to be following that
1218074 shes literally the most humble athlete i ever met i raced against her a couple of times my freshman year i think one time i even stayed with her for the first 30 meters of a 200 meter race but afterwards shed always say you ran great or you did great i was thinking you dont have to do that but thats just her
1218075 what he does have is that marvelous speed and thats a major thing you have to be concerned about
1218076 four years ago i won gold at the world junior championships in italy four years later i believe i can do the same thing on the pro level
1218077 off the track we speak and are cordial its not like we get together and break bread together because at the end of the day when we line up im trying to take food off his plate and hes trying to take food off mine
1218078 i dont set myself up for disappointment i set myself up for success
1218079 i just need to get in the right race at the right time i just need everything to line up
1218080 im a way way stronger athlete now way faster too
1218081 im always aware of the situation in sudan and all the negative things that are seen by the world
1218082 but im glad i can do something positive for sudan im looking forward to raising the flag at the olympics
1218083 people in sudan love the track team because they perform and they are a mixture of tribes and share rooms and eat together right now its the only positive thing happening in sudan
1218084 it all revolves around this meet right here he said of the beijing games if im an olympic gold medalist i can be the superstar i want to be mary wineberg is a late bloomer in the 400
1218085 even three years ago if you would have asked me if i thought she could do this id have said no its not that i didnt support her but it would have been foolish and unrealistic to think that shed get to this level
1218086 its about all out attacking for 300 meters or 150 meters and then resting and then doing it again
1218087 my competitors do 600 meter workouts in the end well do the same volume just in different increments
1218088 its pretty exciting getting up on those girls staying close to them in every race ive run its a good target too when i get into the olympics
1218089 i just couldnt keep up with my legs i really couldnt
1218090 at this point im going to try and pick up a part time job i have no choice
1218091 they were joking the other day and saying were going to work at mcdonalds and make more than you are its a sad truth
1218092 it was my understanding when i took the job that state jobs were the best ones to have but now im not sure
1218093 this is the dmv where i usually come and i never spend more than an hour here ive already been here an hour and ive got 30 numbers to go
1218094 hey hey ho ho 6 55 has got to go

1218096 if the revenue is not there but you require a balanced budget its just like a home budget if you are not working as much you have to sit down with your family and fight it out
1218097 not knowing how you are going to take care of your family is very unsettling

1218194 the united states militarys procedures for recruiting students plainly violate internationally accepted standards and fail to protect youth from abusive and aggressive recruitment tactics
1218195 regularly target children under 17 for military recruitment heavily recruiting on high school campuses in school lunchrooms and in classes

1218208 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1218209 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1218210 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1218211 we sent a total of three teams and it was common knowledge that all the interviews with the detainees were videotaped and recorded
1218212 most businesses are started because you have a great idea and you take it out to the public to see if they like it
1218213 this is the opposite were finding out what people want and doing it

1218247 i will let go of what i give and give it freely with no expectation of it coming back to me no expectation of a person having to give me in return but i will also know that the universe will immediately meet that expression equally and abundantly and i dont have to know where its coming from
1218248 if i cannot love myself and i cannot trust myself then in the end i have not really lived and if i have a partner that i do not trust i cannot love unconditionally because i dont love myself enough to trust whatever happens thus i really dont have a relationship i am only striving to find one

1218264 the ecb will likely maintain the refinancing rate at 4 25 percent
1218265 despite increasing downside risks to growth ecb president jean claude trichet will probably renew warnings on the central banks commitment to fight second round effects he should stick to the neutral bias mantra
1218266 clearly a further interest rate hike is a real possibility and the ecb is very likely to keep talking tough on inflation
1218267 nevertheless we believe that 4 25 percent will mark the peak in euro zone interest rates although any cut is extremely unlikely to occur until 2009
1218268 we expect markedly weaker euro zone growth softening labor markets extended tight credit conditions and the strong euro to largely contain and then increasingly dilute underlying inflation pressures over the coming months
1218269 the boe should leave the rate at 5 percent this week
1218270 unchanged interest rates seem by far the most probable outcome
1218271 but it is not inconceivable that interest rates could be either raised or cut
1218272 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1218273 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1218274 it can use virtualization to duplicate a complete distributed environment within a single box effectively offering the possibility of recreating a production environment with a minimum of resources and time
1218275 duplication requires a deep knowledge of the production environment this is where stacksafes secret sauce enters the picture by providing the means to effectively collect the application and its environment directly from the production infrastructure stacksafes solution provides the sandbox required to reduce the risks inherent in change
1218276 virtual machines are becoming increasingly common in todays heterogeneous it operations environment and this enhancement to our virtualized import capability puts stacksafe ahead of the curve

1218279 all legislative and administrative actions taken by israel to change the status of the city of jerusalem including exporpriation of land and properties transfer of populations and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section are totally invalid and cannot change that status

1218290 all she kept saying was why me why me why did they do this to me
1218291 im angry because somebody came in here and violated her and i am worried because we have several other old people in the neighborhood
1218292 there was nothing she was going to do to hurt this guy so really you have an individual here that needs to be taken off the streets and put behind bars

1218343 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1218344 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1218345 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1218346 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices

1218354 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals

1218438 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach us 6 1 billion more than wiping out the us 5 6 billion that airlines made in 2007 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
1218439 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense
1218440 theres a little bit of that let me show you but its balanced by the fact those are the guys that brought me into this league like family in a sense
1218441 anybody whos gone through that been beaten up a little bit theres going to be a confidence factor
1218442 not playing last year was probably one of the hardest things i ever had to go through period
1218443 while last year sucked and going through that was tough i dont feel like they were unfair to me if i look at it like an adult they gave me a fair shake
1218444 to be honest with you i wanted a fresh start somewhere else
1218445 i wanted to get out of this market and start all over
1218446 anybody who has gone through a year like last year would find it rather challenging
1218447 you have to take a step back and reassess yourself see where you are and kind of look at yourself in the mirror
1218448 in terms of going out there and feeling like i can get the job done i feel i can do that

1218456 edge hill comes out fine for the feeds we offer on the homepage with news events and job vacancies listed there s a few heis who offer other feeds open days could be useful and we have a feed available for it through a tag on the events system but the one that caught my eye was the university of warwick s recent changes feed which allows you to subscribe to find out when the homepage changes better still they have this for every page in their cms where this falls down is when feed readers like google reader just take the first feed in the page from those available through autodiscovery thus subscribing you to the recent changes feed instead of the more useful news feed

1218472 from the outside looking in it probably seems like we should be pressing more trying to impress coach
1218473 but nothing changes mentally we are just trying to get the offense moving
1218474 all three of us are going to make plays we are all good football players there are going to be great spots and mistakes you have to look at the bigger picture
1218475 i expect to start but i dont expect it based on anything that happened last year or anything that happened in spring or anything thats happened thus far i expect to start by staying consistent the rest of this camp and proving that im the quarterback that gives this team the best chance to win
1218476 if you just go out and succeed in practice youre going to do it in a game
1218477 if you play well every day you should expect to do the same in a game maybe that experience factor that plays a little into it as far as handling pressure and being calm but i think we get that in practice too we had two spring games weve had multiple practices ive felt pressure ive had to be calm and cool and collected i think that experience has come in different ways for me

1218483 i was just asking gore not to punch me in the face you know how it is we dont fight anymore we sue
1218484 thats how we want him to be at every practice not just because were going to play somebody else

1218490 obviously i wanted to ask him what do you think of the young guy
1218491 and he brought up some good points about his evaluation of practice
1218492 hes got a lot of talent and a lot going through his mind if they just keep it simple he seems to have a real good feel for it i think hes going to do good things
1218493 you can tell from offseason training until now hes getting comfortable with the offense

1218503 fears of insolvency have not as yet been fully set aside
1218504 there may be numbers of banks and other financial institutions that at the edge of defaulting will end up being bailed out by governments
1218505 lower global stock prices could impede the recapitalisation of banks and other financial institutions debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1218506 the price of equities worldwide will determine whether the international financial system can maintain a modicum of stability as it eases out of its credit crunch or falls back into another period of angst and turmoil
1218507 the cause of our economic despair however is human natures propensity to sway from fear to euphoria and back a condition that no economic paradigm has proved capable of suppressing without severe hardship
1218508 regulation the alleged effective solution to todays crisis has never been able to eliminate historys crises
1218509 we may not easily confront or accept the price dynamics of home and equity prices but we can fend off cries of political despair which counsel the containment of competitive markets
1218510 for some chinese companies you could argue they need only five to 15 years to develop a global brand
1218511 perhaps consumers all over the world will think china is all low end but we want to be the high end
1218512 to change that view is very difficult but we have no choice

1218516 for the past 10 years ive been coming to comic con
1218517 just last year i paid a dealer here 300 for what i was told was a pristine copy of roger cormans fantastic four when i got back home i called all of my friends and told them to come on over and watch this movie with me only to then find out that id been sold a copy of dolph lundgren
1218518 very dark in a pre harry potter sort of way but as a ufo afficiando i wondered how would you update the witch mountain mythology so that it would then play for todays audiences
1218519 what i meant by that was that i wanted to make a kick ass thrill ride of a movie
1218520 a contemporary action adventure that was heavily steeped in the world of ufos
1218521 a family film that will entertain everyone from 8 to 80
1218522 those two movies really raised the bar when it comes to action films
1218523 and disney to their credit really let us push the envelope when it comes to a family film there are some pretty intense chases amp action sequences in this picture
1218524 escape to witch mountain is a movie that we all loved as kids
1218525 so if steve isnt working on the tr2n screenplay anymore who is then
1218526 com certeza esse entrosamento contribui muito pois foi com o nilo v o que conquistei os meus maiores t tulos e o investimento do victor oliva que acreditou no meu potencial foi fundamental se n o fosse por ele que como um pai para mim eu n o estaria aqui

1218528 but i kept telling than that marriage isnt a fantasy its an adventure which is why i wanted to propose at the adventurers club
1218529 shed read about it on the web and when she told me my immediate thought was that disney couldnt be serious about closing such a unique entertainment i mean no disrespect to those disneyana fans who tried to save mr toad back in 1998 but there are lots of rides out there that are similar to that attraction where you get in you spin and then get out but there is only one adventurers club in the world
1218530 and the first thing that came to mind was compasses that wed send disney company executives this huge pile of compasses which would hopefully get across the whole
1218531 maps are perfect everyones got one or two old ones lying around their house
1218532 so all it would cost for a person to take part in this particular save the adventurers club campaign is postage
1218533 first open the map and circle where you live then draw arrows from your location to where the adventurers club is located because to be honest im not sure that disneys current management team actually knows where the club is i mean they cant seriously have visited this place if theyve now planning on closing the adventurers club down no one whos ever been in that club seen those shows and interacted with that cast could ever bring themselves to shut such a unique entertainment down now take that map and stuff it in an envelope which youll then address to the walt disney company attn robert a iger 500 south buena vista street burbank ca 91521 copyright disney all rights reserved why send these maps to bob iger because hes the one guy at disney whos shown that hes not afraid to reverse course back away from a bad decision i mean look pixar slip away bob was the only executive who could see that disney was making a tremendous mistake there which is why steve jobs so im hoping that if we all send iger maps hell then see the error of his ways bob will realize what a tremendous under exploited asset the adventurers club is after all its the only part of pleasure island that literally has fans all over the planet people who have great affection for real dedication to that particular club and theyll happily continue to spend their money there if disney just smartens up reverses this unfortunate decision and keeps the adventurers club open
1218534 put bob iger on the right path point this man in the right direction send disneys ceo a map and let bob know that you want him to keep the adventurers club open
1218535 we offer the reseller a technology stack which they can install at the customers site and resellers get a meter reading of the printers every month that tells them what theyve printed

1218538 the reseller has the ability to organise the contract to suit the needs of each user
1218539 were providing them with the infrastructure and ability to enter this program without a massive investment in software or personnel which they might otherwise require
1218540 the smb market is big and people havent been able to target it effectively with this level of service
1218541 we want to have sufficient coverage to cover the country and specific vertical markets but were not looking to completely saturate it
1218542 i would negotiate a free trade agreement with almost any country if i were president i would negotiate free trade agreement with almost any country willing to negotiate fairly with us
1218543 some of those manufacturing jobs are not coming back and you know it and i know it
1218544 the economists that i know and trust and the history that i study and i study a lot of history says that free trade is the best thing that can happen to our nation when we have practiced protectionism it has had devastating consequences
1218545 i cant tell you these jobs are ever going to come back during a campaign trip to youngstown ohio john mccain said i cant tell you that these jobs are ever going to come back to this magnificent part of the country but i will commit to giving these workers a second chance they need it they deserve it but i cant look you in the eye and tell you those steel mills are coming back
1218546 so we want people to be part of that revolution and weve got to be part of that new economy rather than try to cling to an old economy
1218547 there are some jobs that arent coming back to michigan
1218548 sometimes you have to tell people things they dont want to hear along with things that they do want to hear there are jobs lets have a little straight talk there are some jobs that arent coming back to michigan
1218549 if we start seeing what a lot of us expect and that is a strong economy cannot go forever without picking up jobs i dont care how many of them you outsource then i think the president is going to be helped by that
1218550 a man in littleton colorado complained that free trade policies were destroying the textile industry
1218551 worried about possible government reaction to the movement of u
1218552 there is no job that is americas god given right anymore
1218553 the biggest barrier to solutions is our nations attention span
1218554 america has little to fear from competition with a southern neighbor with an economy one twentieth the size of ours and a trade deficit with the united states that exists despite the fact that mexico currently imposes higher tariffs on our goods than we impose on theirs every member of congress should have the courage and wisdom to vote for nafta for no other reason than it is so clearly in the interests of our nation put plainly americans have prospered substantially from liberalized trade with mexico and they stand to prosper even more under nafta there is no credible argument to disprove that simple fact
1218555 the rise in the u s trade deficit with canada and mexico through 2004 has caused the displacement of production that supported 1 015 291 u s jobs since the north american free trade agreement nafta was signed in 1993
1218556 we need to build on the passage of the central america free trade agreement by expanding u s trade with the region lets start by ratifying the trade agreements with panama peru and colombia that are already completed and pushing forward the free trade area of the americas too many democrats have embraced economic isolationism paying off special interests by opposing trade agreements with our democratic neighbors they could not be more wrong my administration would reduce barriers to trade and press for renewed trade promotion authority
1218557 today president bush signed a letter of transmission that will formally send the united states colombia free trade agreement to congress for approval i strongly support this vital trade pact and urge my colleagues to support its swift passage
1218558 shows an outrageous disregard for basic human and workers rights
1218559 although fast track legislation mentions the words labor and environment it does nothing to ensure that enforceable labor and environmental standards will be incorporated into future trade agreements fast track would produce more flawed trade agreements that drain good jobs from this country at a time when unemployment and economic insecurity are at their highest levels in a decade and the afl cio is strongly opposed
1218560 the caribbean basin initiative is not a trade agreement rather it is a special duty free access to the u s market for textiles apparel and other goods made in the 24 country cbi region

1218579 the operational cost of doing business in north america and around the world is steadily increasing especially when it comes to freight and transport
1218580 this economic reality makes it necessary for ingram micro to globally adjust current freight and sales terms and conditions to allow for rising fuel freight and handling costs

1218591 as blue chip exporters are facing a slowdown investor money has been flowing into winners in the retail sector
1218592 theres a little bit of improvement in demand from the jewellery sector
1218593 people are expecting demand from automakers to decrease because of poor sales especially in north america sentiment is too bearish
1218594 i guess sentiment is also bearish on gold and physical buyers are simply waiting for the price to fall further it may find support around 890

1218611 you thought oh my gosh all three of these guys could be starting in the nfl
1218612 these three could all be starters in the big 12 in my opinion
1218613 youve got a tough decision when youre trying to pick one and theres not one there
1218614 i dont want to say anyones ahead necessarily that would be unfair
1218615 they all did a nice job in the spring i was excited about all of them
1218616 its been like this every year everybodys got to earn their position
1218617 you like that you want that as a player you want to be pushed and be the best player you can possibly be
1218618 things like that i really cant control so i try not to worry about them
1218619 mcgee has played his games and hes a great quarterback i just try to do what i can every day and go about my business
1218620 this is the offense ive always wanted to be in
1218621 there is a confidence and leadership that comes from being the guy
1218622 but no matter where i am or who i am i can still be a leader and help people around me
1218623 the guys all respect each other its not a catfight for the job
1218624 in my mind im just like mike goodson when i get on the field
1218625 but its just football to me as long as i get to touch the rock some im good
1218626 its just another step in my life that i have to overcome
1218627 but that is ludicrous i dont understand why they think that i would be a distraction to tony do they really think he can see way far up in that box no
1218628 hes paying attention to the game not what im doing up in the seats come on people
1218629 i appreciate every opportunity both schools have given me and hope this gift will afford other young women the same opportunities
1218630 i shaved it as soon as i came out of the game
1218631 we were losing when they hit that grand slam and then we came back and won
1218632 in about a week it will be back it goes hand and hand with winning
1218633 i would have kept it if we were winning that game
1218634 if youre in a conventional offense and huddle up its gonna cost you plays no question
1218635 i think ill have a second or two less from the time you get the play
1218636 it should make for a more standard way to officiate the game
1218637 my dad made me realize what things are really worth
1218638 just coming to america there are so many things it makes me really appreciate
1218639 i used that to kind of motivate myself and see how hard people work and how proud people are to represent their country
1218640 from that point on i was like man i want to go to the olympics
1218641 the best thing that could happen for me is winning the gold for the united states
1218642 being an american is not something im going to take lightly when i took that oath i meant every piece of it
1218643 when i told them i was going to run they were actually kind of mad at me like what are you doing
1218644 but when they noticed where this could take me they changed they became totally supportive
1218645 a few wrinkles stoops did open two practices for fans on friday and monday aug 18
1218646 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1218647 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1218648 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let mccarthy decide from there
1218649 its just like racing horses you cant run them every day and expect them go out there on race day and perform at their best
1218650 the same with cars you run them to a certain point then you put them in the shop and go through the diagnostics thats me right now
1218651 i aint got on the scale i dont really get on the scale thats not my thing
1218652 there is if i may remind you only one pine bush however you could put a hotel anywhere
1218653 every time theres an office building residence hotel whatever in the pine bush there are vacancies in downtown albany
1218654 my client tharaldson is committed to building this project or they would have gone a lone time ago
1218655 oh my god i got so drunk last night and i totally made out with that guy
1218656 generally predisposed to dragging my ass up and down a giant rock
1218657 were here to address our grievances logically and professionally someone that doesnt have that intention you should target
1218658 there is a man named cho seung hui who had valid permits for each one of his handguns but that didnt keep him from taking the handguns he lawfully owned and shooting and killing 32 people in virginia tech
1218659 i think the standard is important for the comfort and safety of our employees
1218660 if they have it in their hearts to hurt someone they are gonna we cant legislate that
1218661 bring back firefly bring back firefly one two three we want sereni tee
1218662 will i get something i desire in return for my efforts
1218663 we dont have time to debate everything but if you object they ought to be willing to negotiate with you but usually they put the press after you
1218664 the mobileme launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about internet services

1218774 we hope these videos will support the healthy emotional development of military children and adolescents during potentially difficult times in their lives
1218775 we also hope these videos will decrease feelings of stigma and isolation in our military children while sensitizing the larger american community to military child and adolescent culture and support needs
1218776 our goal is to reduce the anxiety and fear surrounding a military deployment and let children know they are not alone in the struggles their families are facing
1218777 within just a couple of weeks of my departure my normally well behaved 4 year old son started having some acting out behavior and a little bit of regression kind of moving backward in his development
1218778 he was expressing that he wasnt comfortable with my absence
1218779 when i got back from my deployment a lot of other soldiers were deploying and i began to notice a lot of children who were presenting with complaints of headaches and stomachaches that i couldnt explain
1218780 as pediatricians we are not trained to look that closely at how emotional concerns and stress affect the physical health of our young patients
1218781 however we are hoping to address that lack of training through the videos weve developed and many other opportunities developing through the military child and adolescent center of excellence that is being established at madigan army medical center
1218782 as we start to frame the discussion more in terms of military family readiness and support it is becoming more popular
1218783 as we provide more support for our military families to prepare them for the potential stresses of deployment and separation then our warriors are going to be more able to focus on their mission
1218784 being a military child or adolescent is actually a very unique experience
1218785 we think belonging to a military family really is a special thing military children serve and sacrifice for their nation in a way that is very important and is different from the way we as military servicemembers serve and sacrifice
1218786 they advocate for educational issues for children making sure that military children are treated fairly when they transfer into new school districts and that their credits transfer and they dont have to retake the basic history course every time they move to a new place because they are military kids
1218787 we know children experience stress differently based on their developmental age
1218788 younger children may have significant attachment concerns when their parents deploy they need to attach to their parents feel comfortable and connected in order to grow up emotionally healthy
1218789 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1218790 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1218791 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them
1218792 the ecb will likely maintain the refinancing rate at 4 25 percent
1218793 despite increasing downside risks to growth ecb president jean claude trichet will probably renew warnings on the central banks commitment to fight second round effects he should stick to the neutral bias mantra
1218794 clearly a further interest rate hike is a real possibility and the ecb is very likely to keep talking tough on inflation
1218795 nevertheless we believe that 4 25 percent will mark the peak in euro zone interest rates although any cut is extremely unlikely to occur until 2009
1218796 we expect markedly weaker euro zone growth softening labor markets extended tight credit conditions and the strong euro to largely contain and then increasingly dilute underlying inflation pressures over the coming months
1218797 the boe should leave the rate at 5 percent this week
1218798 unchanged interest rates seem by far the most probable outcome
1218799 but it is not inconceivable that interest rates could be either raised or cut
1218800 although we would not rule out a cut in november before being cut steadily to 4 25 percent by mid 2009 and to 3 75 percent by the fourth quarter of next year

1218955 journalistic work for an indefinite but god willing not too lengthy period
1218956 given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical
1218957 ive been completely left out with regard to any understanding of the progress of the investigation or what these latest developments may mean

1219013 in these last two weeks weve often spoken both in the bishops and in the spouses conference about telling our stories its almost a clich isnt it in a good and properly organized christian meeting we tell our stories and that is right and proper because one of the most significant things any believer can ever do is to say come and i will tell you what he has done for my soul perhaps we can go back to our local apostolic ministries to tell the story of this meeting this lambeth conference in such a way that it becomes itself a story that makes things happen we can ask god to strengthen us and enable us so to talk about what weve received here that something shifts and grows and deepens in the christian communities to which we belong we can try to tell the story of the lambeth 08 conference so that something happens so that christ comes alive in others

1219023 they said his hands were two times bigger than they should be and he had marks all on his hands

1219042 but would it be fair to put the economy into a deep recession or depression i dont think so
1219043 t he experience was a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces
1219044 the drastic decline in the quantity of money during those years and the occurrence of a banking panic of unprecedented severity were not the inevitable consequences of other economic changes
1219045 throughout the contraction the system had ample powers to cut short the tragic process of monetary deflation and banking collapse had it used those powers effectively in late 1930 or even in early to mid 1931 such action would have eased the severity of the contraction and very likely would have brought it to an end at a much earlier date

1219071 they have the means to get the word out and get it organized
1219072 it really has spread quickly out of town and out of state through word of mouth
1219073 planning preparing and waging the supreme crime of a war of aggression in contravention of the united nations charter and the nuremberg principles
1219074 that there be an exhaustive investigation of those responsible for the crime of aggression war crimes and crimes against humanity in iraq beginning with bush and blair those in key decision making positions in these countries and in the coalition of the willing those in the military chain of command who masterminded the strategy for and carried out this criminal war starting from the very top and going down as well as personalities in iraq who helped prepare this illegal invasion and supported the occupiers
1219075 please dont put our entree order in until we have finished our appetizers
1219076 this place has got a good location i can walk right over to target and look at all the colorful stuff
1219077 hey some geese on the lawn who wants a cheeseburger ha ha ha
1219078 this wireless bridge is weird why dont they just have laptop cards
1219079 man i wish there were more tv stations how am i supposed to watch mythbusters
1219080 snacktime wait theres a coke machine but no snacks what the hell
1219081 ah nothing like a good nights sleep i can adjust the temperature however i want
1219082 oh crap oh crap this water is taking forever to get warm and wheres the damn water pressure they got a freakin handheld shower thing for a showerhead
1219083 dang this faucet wants to come out of the wall
1219084 cold doughnuts what did they just take these out the fridgerator its like theyre not even trying blech
1219085 obviously its a pretty short time period to consider the past three months as a valid data set
1219086 but its an encouraging sign starting right out of the box
1219087 were getting an abundance of stocks that look attractive which is an indication that the markets trading cheap right now
1219088 were using the 2 000 largest stocks by market cap size
1219089 so weve got a flexible universe that we update every week that gives us an advantage over the indexes that are basically stuck in a group of stocks
1219090 we can change up to three stocks a week on a 50 stock portfolio like the one we use with pqz
1219091 but thats a self imposed limit if you actually changed three stocks per week over the course of a year that would be over a 300 turnover rate
1219092 our ability to eliminate lagging stocks when needed has been the key this year
1219093 we calculate the rating for every company every day but it takes a significant price change or earnings report to effect fundamental grades
1219094 were still searching for the right mix with that portfolio
1219095 so were turning over the maximum of three stocks per week because were getting a lot of blow ups for example recently we eliminated ebay
1219096 it doesnt pass our screens because its pe price earnings ratio is too high
1219097 en chile no hay gente con el talento para hacer eso
1219098 quiero decirles que gracias a dios frida est bien que esta es una oportunidad para m para ser mejor mam mejor mujer mejor persona y quererla y amarla y protegerla como nunca

1219100 this is more of a town hall event and people will have much more access to mr obama
1219101 we wont be making any money but our costs will be covered
1219102 ron told her to send the tax amount on her winnings 3 980 through a money gram available at any wal mart store near her to gain her confidence and to help with the expense the canadian financial company had sent her a check for 4 920 as an advance on her winnings
1219103 were seeing a lot of checks lately frank pihoker of the the postal inspector office in cleveland said of the recent trend in scams some of the counterfeit checks can even clear a bank initially he noted
1219104 in the past we were a strong team we had a lot of good results but for various reasons our performances have been up and down
1219105 in training we have focused on two things creating team unity and also training hard and raising technical standards but we are still some distance behind the top teams in the world
1219106 its crazy how much work it is just to get somewhere to take our clothes off
1219107 i remember going to a park in munich right in the middle of the city and everyone was nude entire families no big deal no one looked twice here they have to put up a big sign warning you that you might see a naked person its nuts
1219108 hes got it down to a science he must come here every weekend every day maybe
1219109 i told her to just worry about herself her kids her husband her own family and stay the hell out of it
1219110 im going to go over there and tell that lady to shut the fuck up
1219111 what did you do did you use some kind of witchcraft did you astral project over there and cut that womans tongue out
1219112 its so nice and quiet ill take a few pervs over screaming kids any day
1219113 even with sun block i feel like im gonna be sorry i always miss a spot somewhere
1219114 you know what i just realized i havent posted any nude photos since our wedding
1219115 oui madame on va vous faire les cr dits n cessaires tout va rentrer dans lordre
1219116 seriously concerned that the iron curtain countries should be admonished not to exploit contacts at the games for propaganda purposes
1219117 i had no idea where i was there were three of us in the room heres the guys name they said
1219118 heres what he looks like we will contact you in rome and go from there if you do it they wanted me to meet with him because they figured i was a medical student and it would have more merit to it
1219119 if you play one game you will be ineligible for all amateur athletic events in track and field
1219120 i could have said fuck im going to do it and give up my amateur athletics but i still was pissed that i didnt get to go to melbourne bobby morrow who i beat every time when i was healthy wins the gold medals and im sitting back home so now i didnt know what to do
1219121 he is wonderful he is the best i collect all his records
1219122 looked like an ivy leaguer and acted like a beatnik
1219123 our sportsmen represent the new socialistic order where mental health and moral purity are harmonically tied with physical development sports and physical development are the habit of the nation they are the source of the good spirit happiness hard work and long lives of the soviet people
1219124 take down names of all of us and then after the games well reconfirm
1219125 the communists are now putting more emphasis on propaganda through deeds than through words
1219126 an understanding that sputnik the soviet icbm the bolshoi ballet or a soviet victory at the olympics has more propaganda value than mere words
1219127 it is the goal of each of us to win a gold medal naturally thats not possible for all but we do hope to do the best job possible of representing our country
1219128 i had to be one of the happiest people at city hall that day
1219129 i get up because i wanted to go visit the head in the back anyway the whole plane is pretty dark except for the noisy section where there is much activity as i pass on the way to the head i see in the middle of it all four cyclists mixed in with the big guys theyre playing cards and there are beer bottles and money all over the place and lots of laughter this is the olympics were going to up late drinking beer and gambling
1219130 i said people this childs running a little too fast
1219131 then rudolph ran her best ever time in the 200 and a week later the same thing happened at the olympic trials skeeter was on the move
1219132 just get to the finals if only we can get wilma and maybe another tigerbelle to the finals that would mean they were among the best six in the world then maybe by some miracle they could get a third place just get up on the stand
1219133 the boxers were seated up near the cockpit which did nothing to soothe clays apprehension
1219134 to which wilbert mcclure a light middleweight from the university of toledo would respond
1219135 so the coach gave us a sleeping pill to knock us all out and cassius was able to overcome the sleeping pill and was still screaming
1219136 talking about who would win gold medals and dada dada dada and he had good ideas and picked the guys who were going to win
1219137 had the olympic style and were furthering the olympic image
1219138 you have all recorded good results in the athletic competition of the armed forces this year
1219139 the question is whether such victory will continue as well as it has so far you athletes are the ones to answer that question
1219140 equal partners from east and west with equal rights and duties
1219141 he went on for fifteen minutes enthusiastically painting a beautiful picture
1219142 in bale german and swiss customs waved people through like traffic police
1219143 in chiasso the swiss customs could hardly be seen but the italians at the border force people to leave their cars fill out forms put stamps in travel documents and do not care if the line of cars is getting longer and longer
1219144 simply a sightseeing trip for officials who want to see the alps
1219145 if you put your ear in you could hear the gravel moving
1219146 in 32 years of sports writing no experience ive had has been more rewarding than the privilege of joining the olympic squad now its a trip into the alps then the train ride to rome tuesday
1219147 it was all fun and we laughed and talked the whole time
1219148 no one could understand when we asked where our compartments were
1219149 wed go one way and get a no wed start the other way and get another no finally we let down a window and piled all our luggage into the first empty compartment except that it wasnt empty there was a guy asleep in one corner we piled our bags all around him and it was a wonder he didnt smother when we finally discovered where we belonged it was ten cars away when we got the last bag out i was relieved to see the guy in the corner still breathing and still asleep
1219150 we get into rome and i feel like shit sore throat and its one hundred three degrees or something
1219151 he says strep throat so i get a shot in the ass both cheeks
1219152 im mr face my match will be the most epic ever
1219153 hes got some stiffness and well just see what it is i didnt think it was anything serious just because the velocity was still there
1219154 its in the deltoid below my shoulder strength is fine velocity is fine
1219155 he said he felt ok but ive got to hear that he feels great
1219156 il petrolio e gli altri combustibili fossili sono in via di esaurimento ma anche luranio destinato a scarseggiare entro 35 40 anni non possiamo continuare perci a elaborare piani energetici sulla base di previsioni sbagliate che rischiano di portarci fuori strada dobbiamo sviluppare la pi importante fonte energetica che la natura mette da sempre a nostra disposizione senza limiti a costo zero e cio il sole che ogni giorno illumina e riscalda la terra
1219157 non esiste un nucleare sicuro o a bassa produzione di scorie esiste un calcolo delle probabilit per cui ogni cento anni un incidente nucleare possibile e questo evidentemente aumenta con il numero delle centrali
1219158 il carbone la fonte energetica pi inquinante pi pericolosa per la salute dellumanit ma non si risolve il problema nascondendo lanidride carbonica sotto terra in realt nessuno dice quanto tempo debba restare eppure la co2 dura in media fino a 30 mila anni contro i 22 mila del plutonio no il ritorno al carbone sarebbe drammatico disastroso
1219159 c un impianto per la produzione di energia solare costruito nel deserto del nevada su progetto spagnolo
1219160 i nuovi impianti solari termodinamici a concentrazione catturano lenergia e la trattengono in speciali contenitori fino a quando serve poi attraverso uno scambiatore di calore si produce il vapore che muove le turbine n pi n meno come una diga che negli impianti idroelettrici ferma lacqua e al momento opportuno la rilascia per alimentare la corrente
1219161 il sole non soggetto ai monopoli e non paga la bolletta mi creda questa una grande opportunit per il nostro paese se non lo faremo noi molto presto lo faranno gli americani com accaduto del resto per il computer ventanni fa
1219162 it was a carjacking and it couldve happened to you it couldve happened to anybody watching this broadcast the guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time
1219163 our money has gods name on it the pledge of allegiance has gods name on it congress opens up with a prayer and they run around like chickens with their heads cut off that this is fostering religion i dont think it fosters anything i dont think thats what the founding fathers had in mind
1219164 guess again boys youre in for a fight as diverse we are
1219165 i fight daily with fema for the recovery of our city and now we must fight these tyrants this american taliban who seek to destroy
1219166 due to the displays historical place in the courthouse i explored options to obtain a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of the display without an adversarial court battle
1219167 it might have more to do with the business of the court than purely religious reasons
1219168 the ideas expressed in this painting arent specific to any one faith and they certainly dont establish a single state religion
1219169 the reason americans enjoy equal justice is because we are all created equal endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights this painting is
1219170 you know the aclu is picking on a small community
1219171 judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment
1219172 for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again
1219173 they had weathered hurricanes prior to 57 and what they did not understand was the surge you see the surge is what killed the 500 plus or whatever people
1219174 judge not according to the appearance but judge with righteous judgement john 7 24 for with what judgement you judge you shall be judged
1219175 criminals are going to move on if they see the guardian angels
1219176 they are wasting their resources here they arent even armed the criminals here are going to laugh at them then rob them
1219177 weve been paying taxes and part of that is police protection to put an additional financial burden on small business owners that they have to come up with any fee per month to keep our employees safe and visitors safe thats ridiculous
1219178 to provide physical and tactical security services to our clients with integrity confidentiality and professionalism
1219179 were not going to take it down until we get a legal opinion
1219180 i dont know who it is i personally thought it might be moses or some russian or greek figure i wasnt sure
1219181 ill sleep next to my hammer drill if i have to
1219182 theres a story in this house and whether it happened over a hundred years ago or its happening now it has to keep being told its new orleans culture and im just a page in the book
1219183 our plans are to do whats best for our shareholders
1219184 for the time being we have not made a decision to leave new orleans
1219185 we will begin to work closely with his holiness shankar and his organizations to identify the specific set of needs for the new orleans communities
1219186 for the past 19 months our adults and youth have endured stress and overwhelming challenges associated with the rebuilding our great city and we are open to review the proposals of his holiness shankars for the achievement of harmony stress management and clarity of mind
1219187 p legal feriado o bus o vai vazio vou poder dormir tranquilo sem se preocupar se a tia gorda q sentou do meu lado tah me ouvindo roncar

1219191 nossa que legal o pais est se desenvolvendo na area da tecnologia
1219192 nossa est o me mandando fotos de eu dando vexame bebado em uma festa que eu nem sequer fui mas mas melhor eu clicar aqui para ver as fotos
1219193 nossa ganhei na mega sena t certo que eu nem joguei mas deixa eu clicar aqui para receber meu premio
1219194 duplo click dois click mas rapidinho ou clica e espera h
1219195 during the war 1998 99 many people fled and we witnessed the burning of many houses
1219196 we were very lucky none of our close relatives were killed or murdered or died
1219197 two things stopped us leaving we didnt know where to go and even how safe it would be to travel and secondly my mother suffered from diabetes it would have been very hard to move her
1219198 what i like about mitrovica is that i know a lot of people it takes me an hour to walk down the street into town i stop and talk to so many people
1219199 if i go to a restaurant and cant pay the bill i can always pay later
1219200 he was supposed to visit the town in his famous blue train in 1978
1219201 we waited for hours at the railway station to wave when the trip was cancelled at the last minute we cried all day
1219202 until recently i was a community leader here with a serb
1219203 we met so many donors they organised so many seminars when all we needed was basic services and work
1219204 if a man cant afford to buy food for his family or a toy for his child how can he enjoy sitting and talking
1219205 thats why they should not have gotten rid of kyle farnsworth
1219206 i was actually sort of shocked by it that they werent going to spend the money its not something im used to seeing
1219207 i felt like they have worked to try to keep this budget down
1219208 if i felt like the city was wasting money left and right and was not trying be fiscally conservative with the budget then no i would not be inclined to support it
1219209 it depends on if the citys in better financial structure and can make room for their own vehicle needs
1219210 by all means i dont know that i would commit to it going forward
1219211 this is a fuel efficient american car which was a high priority for me
1219212 get rid of this vehicle and not put any more money into it
1219213 i got here this morning to play and there wasnt a soul out here
1219214 it was a lot different from the last time i walked off this golf course
1219215 it was one of the most memorable weeks ive ever had certainly on that golf course
1219216 and it will be nice to go back to a golf course that i know that ive played well on and refresh and rekindle your mind with those good thoughts
1219217 brands is a track which i have beaten kiyo before in the bsb so it was really great to see him win the double here and i want to congratulate him
1219218 we made some good improvements to the bike in the second race and we put in some good lap times
1219219 tomorrows meeting i think should literally be an effective meeting i think it should also be decisive
1219220 i think just the protectionism that eddies trying to give his club to save the image in fact is detrimental to the very thing youre trying to build and thats the culture
1219221 he mcguire loves the club hes got passion for the club but this has been behind the scenes and theyve always said they can handle it
1219222 well its four times in the last two years that this has happened they arent handling it well at all
1219223 its a big one its someones livelihood i think hes didak had enough chances and to go down this track it just takes it over the edge so i would think maybe yes
1219224 keeping you out its about inviting you in and letting you play
1219225 we think the turnout will be more than 70 per cent as there was a huge presence of women voters there was a festival like atmosphere with no incidents of violence
1219226 its the most disciplined clean and transparent vote the country has ever seen there were no fake votes or intimidation by candidates barring some slow voting due to the new voters list the poll was a huge success
1219227 its unique i havent seen anything like this before the turnout was huge and it was a very successful polls
1219228 there was a great level of enthusiasm at the booths these are the first polls we have had where there have been no reports of untoward incidents
1219229 we think the turnout will be more than 70 percent as there was a huge presence of women voters there was a festival like atmosphere with no incidents of violence
1219230 its the most disciplined clean and transparent vote the country has ever seen there were no fake votes or intimidation by candidates barring some slow voting due to the new voters list the poll was a huge success
1219231 its unique i havent seen anything like this before the turnout was huge and it was a very successful polls
1219232 there was a great level of enthusiasm at the booths these are the first polls we have had where there have been no reports of untoward incidents
1219233 the new date has been set after fresh hope appeared of reaching an agreement
1219234 if this issue is not solved in the next two days and the rivals do not reach to a compromise the vote on the bill will be delayed until after the summer break
1219235 we will have to reflect with calmness and tranquility on the future of the olympic torch relay
1219236 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1219237 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1219238 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1219239 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1219240 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1219241 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1219242 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized
1219243 hes got some stiffness and well just see what it is i didnt think it was anything serious just because the velocity was still there
1219244 its in the deltoid below my shoulder strength is fine velocity is fine
1219245 he said he felt ok but ive got to hear that he feels great
1219246 eighty one million tonnes of co2 abatement each year by 2020 is around 20 per cent of australias total carbon abatement targets
1219247 and thats a conservative estimate were hopeful that given the appropriate government support the sector will see enhanced growth leading to a contribution of much more than 20 per cent
1219248 to ensure the right regulatory environment at the state and federal levels
1219249 chainsaws and bulldozers for the entirely unnecessary export woodchip industry
1219250 what theyre doing is quite deceitfully diverting attention to a proposal for plantations
1219251 it is nowhere near the destruction that nafi including timber giant gunns is wrecking day by day in the forests of australia these great living natural carbon banks
1219252 now he chavalia gets to get back on with his life
1219253 the message i got out of all this is that its ok for police to go and kill in a drug raid
1219254 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
1219255 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
1219256 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
1219257 dont want our people to fish on the entire lake
1219258 would not make a true reciprocal agreement it didnt make sense to us to draw a line
1219259 we would very much be interested in making a reciprocal agreement with tennessee at any time
1219260 i think it would be a great benefit to both sides
1219261 you cannot like us since you have never been there
1219262 theres a lot of action in the third series more than ever before and thats what the shows about its about action so even though robins devastated about her death he really steps things up to make up for it
1219263 the short course at watkins glen is not one of my favorite courses
1219264 the long course is a lot of fun but the short course makes for a really tough race it is going to be two hours of complete chaos it will be very difficult to pass because it has a lot of fast corners
1219265 however i think the difference for us now is that we are starting to get this car squared away and we are racing with the leaders if we qualify well and we are at the front of the train i think we have a chance to win i also think that no matter where we go now we will be a strong contender
1219266 everywhere we go with the new car we have a good chance to win
1219267 this is what we should have been doing all year long but we did not get the chance until recently the guys are getting a real good grasp on how the car works our engineer greg fordahl is getting a better idea of how to click the right things to make it go fast even though he hasnt had the opportunity to do it in the past this means he was pretty good right out of the box with this car and i think going into watkins glen we should be pretty strong
1219268 in the last two races weve been in contention to win
1219269 so heading into watkins glen i have every reason to believe weve got a real good shot to win
1219270 much like the race in montreal this race is only two hours long and fuel strategy might play an important role once again this is especially true if we dont have many cautions the montreal race only had two cautions and we came up short on the last lap if this race is similar only a few short cautions at least we now know what we have to do to make it to the end
1219271 did one or two families maybe have a good time probably
1219272 since the storm i havent had no energy or pep to go get a job but when push comes to shove i will
1219273 americans want to know why their tax dollars are being wasted
1219274 you have a lot more time than i do why dont you look into these on a case by case basis and file a complaint with fema
1219275 you got all the time in the world young lady you go do it
1219276 come on people move to the back i need this space theres a wheelchair
1219277 i found an old gas stove and an old refrigerator and one of my brothers found a wonderful old sink its not exactly like it was but its close
1219278 my husband and i and other family members worked as fast as we could to get as far as we could for this weekend
1219279 we still have a ways to go but were getting there it should be finished for the festival next year
1219280 the bedrooms are set up much as they were when my mom lived here it was a very small house for the family so there was a lot of sharing and closeness
1219281 i painted the outside terra cotta and by the side door sits a rooster with a fair stick my grandmother had chickens and an old rooster made it a challenge to gather eggs so whoever was going out to the henhouse carried a stick to keep the rooster away
1219282 the only time i thought what is this crazy thing im doing was when i took the wall covering down in the dining room and the blocks were exposed
1219283 other than that it has been a labor of love
1219284 i think its got more positives because it basically gives people access whats the harm in that its just making music a part of everyones lives
1219285 karpia 07 krok po kroku krok po kroczku id wi ta id wi ta ju wiadomo o co chodzi

1219289 so this week lets fix our eyes on jesus the lord of the past present and future we will see how jesus communicated with his followers and how he coordinated people getting the timing absolutely right creating opportunities and situations so that his plans would succeed
1219290 what does it mean for jesus to be lord in your life are there areas of your life where he doesnt have the final say

1219471 i am not against the hydropower plant project in fact im gladly welcoming projects like this one we are after alternative and renewable sources of energy that will not compromise our environment
1219472 the province is rich in natural resources as well as in skilled manpower what basically hampers our development is the absence of cheap and reliable power supply with this project i am confident that another missing link in our provinces development has finally been resolved
1219473 this project preserves environmental balance aside from providing cheaper and sustainable energy source our province is oozing with water resource hence the opportunity to tap this resource must be our utmost concern to avert the rising cost of crude oil

1219497 if they cant renovate them on their own they shouldnt buy them or renovate them
1219498 otherwise were going to get properties that are stagnate and deteriorate
1219499 they have to develop an attitude they are not going to tolerate it in their community
1219500 no one should have to live in fear and every citizen in this community has to live in peace in their home
1219501 the problem i can see by it being on an individual municipality or a county level is that its going to change from county to county or from city of city
1219502 and so therefore the ordinance is going to be more strenuous in one area and not as strenuous in another this could create a disruption from the construction industry perspective

1219566 when some commissioners toured the berkeley skate park on june 28 they were concerned that most skateboarders were not wearing helmets or other safety equipment
1219567 questions were raised about liability for the city and about the safety of park users the report gives an idea about how much it would cost to bring in more staff to enforce wearing helmets
1219568 some of the younger kids do the berkeley skate park is the busiest skate park in the east bay its not uncommon for the park to have over 200 skaters per day and have 40 or more skaters in the park at any given time
1219569 right now we dont do anything if park users dont listen to us
1219570 clearly in the best interest of the city to enforce the rules
1219571 i have heard of one kid fracturing his forearm when i was director
1219572 clearly the rules say you have to wear helmets and we expect people to wear them
1219573 police often ticketed skaters who did not comply with the state law but this resulted in numerous complaints from participants and parents and resulted in hostile conflicts between the police city staff and skate park users
1219574 staff would try to remove skaters from the park who did not comply with the regulations
1219575 the results were mixed many skaters would simply wait outside the park and come back when the staff persons two hour shift was over or just ignore staff altogether
1219576 plagued by drug use bmx bikers and many older skate park attendees who often threatened or intimated younger skaters
1219577 the amount of money we are putting into it is a quarter of what is required to staff it it would be nice if skateboarders got together and enforced the helmet rule on their own right now with the lack of funds in the city we are in a tough spot
1219578 having skate boarders and bikes together is not a safe situation it would take one serious injury to shut the place down
1219579 its obvious that everybody is falling but i dont understand why people dont see that and start wearing helmets
1219580 its more of a cool thing i guess helmets are not cool i remember when they started giving tickets people just sat down or stopped skateboarding but now no one tells me to wear my helmet anymore so i dont

1219727 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1219728 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
1219729 and if we can come up with a genuine bi partisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of energy independence then that is something i am open to
1219730 i think is a positive step so there are a whole bunch of good things that have been proposed by this bi partisan group
1219731 i remain skeptical of some of the drilling provisions but i will give them credit that the way they crafted the drilling positions are about as careful and responsible as you might expect for a drilling agenda
1219732 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
1219733 i remain skeptical that new offshore drilling will bring down gas prices in the short term or significantly reduce our oil dependence in the long term though i do welcome the establishment of a process that will allow us to make future drilling decisions based on science and fact
1219734 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
1219735 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done

1219743 there was a quote from his baseball coach clint small at tonawanda that said our catcher gene masters is like having another coach on the field
1219744 this is a great thing for the western new york community because its a chance for those that knew him to be connected with him one last time
1219745 for the family its a great honor but its also very emotional because he passed away in 2001
1219746 no matter what he was doing he was going to give you 100 percent i think that right there is exactly why the vikings did so well for so long he coached with that kind of fire and expected the same kind of fire back from his kids
1219747 the biggest thing that i remember was how hard he worked and how he prepared
1219748 he was so focused on making his players believe that if they put in the work and never doubted themselves they would have a great chance to win i try to do that as much as possible today

1219756 vijftien jaar geleden stapten wesley sneijder en ik als binkies binnen bij ajax en stonden onze ouders door weer en wind op de toekomst naar ons te kijken binnenkort zitten ze naast elkaar op de tribune van bernabeu mooi h
1219757 als je bij real mag spelen is dat een ongelooflijk grote eer
1219758 dat de twee binkies van toen rafael en wesley nu bij de mooiste club ter wereld spelen is natuurlijk het grootst denkbare compliment voor de jeugdopleiding van ajax

1219760 het is een emotionele wasmachine ze zijn blij dat ze het er levend vanaf hebben gebracht maar tegelijkertijd erg terneergeslagen door dit trieste bericht
1219761 its something that we had to produce and put out there so we had to put it out there that depth chart wont be the same this afternoon never mind tomorrow so its going to change every single day
1219762 the white house is our hq now and its great to have everything we need here there are plenty of practice fields and the gym is just next door last year we had to drive to town for gym sessions so having everything right here has cut down on travel time
1219763 we cannot simply pretend as senator mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1219764 we need a much bigger and much bolder set of solutions we have to make a serious nationwide commitment to developing new sources of energy and we have to do it right away right now
1219765 i call on senator obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work come off their recess come off their vacation and address this energy challenge to america and do not leave until we do
1219766 what we are finding is that although voters still would prefer that the nations energy problems be solved by new renewable kinds of energy sources wind solar biomass they have now come to the conclusion that maybe oil and natural gas will be part of the solution for quite a while and therefore many of them now favor drilling that they did not favor before they were paying 4 gasoline
1219767 the survey shows quite startlingly that the impact of slowing domestic demand is starting to take its toll on australian business accis director of industry policy and economics greg evans said in canberra
1219768 encouragingly on the inflation front both wage and non wage costs have indeed moderated as have business input prices he said
1219769 acci considers moderation in wage and non wage growth as well as declining business confidence and profit growth reduce the possibility of a wage price inflation spiral despite headline inflation hitting a 13 year high of 4 5 per cent in the year to june mr evans said
1219770 given the notable slowing in growth acci considers that an interest rate cut should be considered as early as possible
1219771 theres a lot of people saying will they wont they has it failed has it succeeded
1219772 it was always a trial and a trial is by its nature a trial to see whether it works to see whether its succeeded to see whether its changed behaviours
1219773 but the lockout was one part of a number of strategies weve got in place
1219774 signs of global economic slowdowns are weighing down demand for commodities as a result pulling crude oil and other commodities prices lower
1219775 the mention in the last statement that downside growth risks appeared to have diminished somewhat now looks like a premature conclusion
1219776 the extension and enhancement of the liquidity facilities suggests the fed remains concerned about financial stability and thus is unlikely to raise rates in the near term
1219777 with oil and commodity prices not growing nearly as rapidly as earlier this year headline inflation rates are set to moderate by the end of the year
1219778 is likely to continue with hawkish rhetoric reiterating their vigilance against inflation but also noting that their expectation that slack in the economy should help mitigate inflationary pressures over several quarters
1219779 were pretty well positioned for the downside risks we might encounter from here
1219780 i worry a little bit more about the prospects for inflation
1219781 i recognize the target is hard to achieve but can we ditch that goal
1219782 it is extremely important for us to strive to meet the goal by implementing various measures
1219783 the situation is certainly tough but we have confirmed that we will abide by that goal
1219784 we have to broadly discuss now how we can achieve the target
1219785 we believe it was a fact we plan to protest strongly
1219786 minor that it would not have any impact on humans

1219789 securitys extremely tight around the olympics village and at all levels ive been to a quite a few games and the only one ive been to that is comparable is moscow
1219790 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1219791 there were lots of dogs and they have left lots of things behind and nobody even tried to collect them
1219792 i have no idea how i can train in such conditions who would clean the discus after every throw
1219793 i think its a real issue for authorities there and also for the australian team and for athletes generally and i know that the australian team medical staff will be monitoring the conditions really closely
1219794 its something i know authorities will watch very closely and i guess its just a bit of a signal to us as to how critical it is that we actually do reduce pollution overall
1219795 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1219796 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar

1219810 the world situation should stay as it is at any cost there should be no changes
1219811 this debilitating dream of a status quo is the symptom of a society which has come to the end of its development
1219812 it is time in the west to defend not so much human rights as human obligations destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space society appears to have little defense against the abyss of human decadence such as for example misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror it is considered to be part of freedom and theoretically counter balanced by the young peoples right not to look or not to accept life organized legalistically has thus shown its inability to defend itself against the corrosion of evil
1219813 the center of your democracy and of your culture is left without electric power for a few hours only and all of a sudden crowds of american citizens start looting and creating havoc the smooth surface film must be very thin then the social system quite unstable and unhealthy
1219814 thus we may see terrorists heroized or secret matters pertaining to ones nations defense publicly revealed or we may witness shameless intrusion on the privacy of well known people under the slogan everyone is entitled to know everything but this is a false slogan characteristic of a false era people also have the right not to know and it is a much more valuable one the right not to have their divine souls stuffed with gossip nonsense vain talk a person who works and leads a meaningful life does not need this excessive burdening flow of information

1219817 if the world has not come to its end it has approached a major turn in history equal in importance to the turn from the middle ages to the renaissance it will exact from us a spiritual upsurge we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era this ascension will be similar to climbing onto the next anthropologic stage no one on earth has any other way left but upward

1219822 neste is attempting to move to renewable feedstocks for making diesel fuel vegetable oils are in principle a renewable source of bio diesel but using food oils fresh water for crop irrigation and agricultural land for fuel production potentially competes with food supplies freshwater supplies and is a potential cause of deforestation
1219823 using micro algal oils for making biofuels is preferable to using vegetable oils
1219824 come close to micro algae in being able to sustainably provide the necessary amounts of bio diesel
1219825 bio diesel from micro algae seems to be the only renewable bio fuel that has the potential to completely displace petroleum derived transport fuels without adversely affecting supply of food and other crop products
1219826 another important advantage of micro algae is that unlike other oil crops they grow extremely rapidly and commonly double their biomass within 24 hours
1219827 in principle it is possible to produce algal bio diesel at roughly the same price as petroleum diesel but extensive research is required to achieve this
1219828 achieving the capacity to inexpensively produce bio diesel from micro algae is of strategic significance to an environmentally sustainable society

1219833 those of us who want to serve our communities in the legislature need to continue to press for reform and build momentum for change there are many good ideas about how to clean up the system what is needed is a broad based consensus to move forward with reforms

1219873 and the professionals all agreed that work must be done and that it is long overdue
1219874 the state by its recklessness and its failure to implement proper safety procedure and to dispatch the relevant safety officials at a heavy industrial site had to accept blame for this fatal accident
1219875 while no amount of recourse would bring back mr bissoo to his family the government has to take requisite action against the officials of the ministry of works who are responsible for hiring contractors and ensuring that they satisfy the necessary health and safety policies
1219876 heavy equipment falling upon a worker is not natural while the contractor must bare such responsibility overall supervision was with the ministry of works
1219877 i had a note in my electronic diary that on august 1 i was going to the wharf to take the water taxi i went but saw no water taxi only four stray dogs and two stray cats
1219878 it does have some important implications for the industry i think
1219879 we are taking a very close look at it we would be sending our comments to the tatt on it before the deadline for public comments on august 29 we would also be channelling certain comments through the ttpba as well there would be an industry position as well as a company position
1219880 under the current proposed code from what we have seen so far there would be a host of programmes and even news items that would be censored
1219881 government is always reacting when something happens they never plan all they do is react
1219882 that should be the normal duty of government to make sure bridges and all the infrastructure are in the correct place
1219883 here is a government that doesnt even know how to dismantle a bridge how can you send people on top of a bridge whilst the bridge is being dismantled
1219884 inflation fuelled by governments wild spending has been driving the cost of goods and services up since the pnm entered office in 2001 people are working and their money has no value because the cost of food and other necessities is going up every day
1219885 we look at every opportunity to sell sports and olympicism to the nation as something that is very valuable but our greatest challenge is not training and getting athletes to the olympics but in getting the population of trinidad and tobago to understand the values of sport and the values of olympicism
1219886 most people in trinidad and tobago think of sport as a game and as such most parents treat it that way by not letting their children participate in sport
1219887 we are very glad that ttpost has grasped the opportunity to highlight the various sporting disciplines that will be at the olympic games and to highlight what the games mean globally
1219888 you have to have four of five breaches to get to that level or it would have to be a very very serious matter
1219889 the fact is an offence that is punishable in that way a decision as to whether imprisonment will be the sentence for any particular breach will have to be made by the court and the court will have its own sentencing guidelines
1219890 censorship is when you see something before and you prohibit certain parts of it from being published or being broadcast before the fact we are dealing with after the fact
1219891 is an offence pursuant to section 65 of the act punishable on summary conviction by a fine of 250 000 and imprisonment of up to five years
1219892 is grounds for the termination or suspension of the concession by the minister responsible for telecommunications acting on the recommendation of the authority
1219893 sir i have a little thing here but my mother send me for it
1219894 these stamps honour our nations participation in the beijing olympics but are they really a testament to the commitment invested by the ministry of sport and the trinidad and tobago olympic committee in developing our athletes
1219895 the ema is therefore unable to consider the grant of a certificate of environmental clearance cec at this time and could only do so when the issues in the review and assessment report are properly addressed

1219904 the only abuse that ever occurred in their household was that of emotional abuse inflicted upon ranae and her dog lacy on the occasions when he hit ranae and her dog with his reaching sticks or kicked them when having one of his drunken rages

1219910 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
1219911 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
1219912 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
1219913 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
1219914 we warned folk to only deal with authorised ticket suppliers
1219915 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
1219916 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
1219917 some suppliers of pharmaceuticals also say that drug companies such as pfizer a research based biomedical and pharmaceutical company are increasing their prices so thats another reason why pharmaceuticals are increasing in cost
1219918 its difficult for a lot of people we try to help out our customers by giving a discount ever so often or by giving credit to some of our regular customers
1219919 we ttrfu were not told of any issues when we made our booking
1219920 i wont say we are as strong as four years ago
1219921 but there is a lot for the fans to look forward to i think with the coming of densill theobald chris birchall avery john cyd gray and the other world cup players and also clyde leon we are much stronger
1219922 we are still gelling but the team has more love now and remember there is still stern john and the others to come in
1219923 i am not accustomed to being injured since the 2006 world cup qualifiers i am now getting back in the thick of things and it has been great with connection so far but the start and stop has stopped me catching form for them this year
1219924 they welcomed me with open arms down there and showed me a lot of love i want to give something back
1219925 i am a bit disappointed with the amount of games we have gotten from whitley
1219926 but he has good reason because they were genuine injuries i guess it was just a case of bad luck for us that he picked up the injuries when we were in competition and was often okay when we were on break and the national team was playing
1219927 he delivered the goods when he joined us last year and we expect to get the same high standards this season
1219928 but i can play anywhere in the midfield it doesnt really matter i have always gotten a more defensive role for the national team with ian porterfield rene simoes leo beenhakker and now maturana
1219929 even though i am playing as a defensive midfield i can still go forward and make things happen i think i am best attacking but it is up to the coach
1219930 no one is safe from public sculptures those endless atrocities
1219931 all of them labeled art in public space unchallenging hunks of aesthetic metal in business parks roundabouts in shopping malls it is time to create diy public art get your hammers get your welding equipment
1219932 we needed to maintain a low standard of political metaphor to give american citizens a chance to understand it from an aesthetic perspective the great firewall is radically mediocre in the end chinas stoic indifference to western art insanity is quite impressive
1219933 its confusing and theyre damn lucky google has such a lovingly orchestrated filter to shelter them from it

1219946 hes savvy and he understands how the play is supposed to work
1219947 and he understands how the play is supposed to work when what was drawn in the book doesnt show up on the field hes one of those players that gets concepts
1219948 i think we all kind of take that same approach
