8320000 because the language and large parts of the api are the same
8320001 por el momento todo lo que s es que tengo el enorme placer de tocar e improvisar con los otros dos page y jones y empezar a trabajar con nuevo material
8320002 el hecho de tocar con dos personas como ellos es algo fenomenal
8320003 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
8320004 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
8320005 you have to rinse this out when youre done shaving
8320006 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
8320007 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
8320008 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
8320009 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
8320010 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
8320011 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
8320012 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
8320013 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
8320014 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
8320015 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
8320016 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
8320017 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
8320018 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
8320019 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
8320020 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
8320021 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
8320022 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
8320023 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
8320024 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
8320025 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
8320026 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
8320027 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
8320028 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
8320029 it gets us a lot of national tv games and it helps us with recruiting
8320030 sometimes its hard to maintain that level of peak performance from week to week
8320031 we havent won the wac outright in a long time thats one thing wed like to do this year but i think playing the non conference schedule we do the positives outweigh the negatives
8320032 itll be a little different for us we sort of have the reputation for being giant killers so were not going to sneak up on anybody
8320033 what they did in baseball is an inspiration for everybody and hopefully that momentum can carry over but what we do in football is very different for us every game is a one game series theres a lot at stake in week 1 not just for us but for everybody
8320034 i was on the phone and i think pat was making calls at the same time i said are you looking for a game we just worked it out from there
8320035 i think our kids are excited to be playing a good team
8320036 they have some great skilled athletes i think everybody in the country knows the history of fresno state and this may be pats best team in the last 10 years
8320037 i grew up on a big cattle ranch about an hour and a half south of fresno
8320038 thats kind of been put on the back burner now that im playing football but maybe in a few years ill get back to that
8320039 leverage youve got to have your legs under you to rope a calf also from a mental aspect youve really got to have your head in it
8320040 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8320041 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8320042 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8320043 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8320044 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8320045 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8320046 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8320047 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8320048 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8320049 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8320050 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8320051 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
8320052 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
8320053 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
8320054 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
8320055 for 1 million dollars how many houses do you have
8320056 on aika saada takaisin maamme jota rakastamme nestittep minua tai barackia esivaaleissa on tullut aika yhdisty yhdeksi puolueeksi yhteisen asian vuoksi maamme ja lastemme kohtalot ovat vaakalaudalla

8320066 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
8320067 it may even be cute to leave the cans with their original finishes graphics string them and hang from trees fun
8320068 honey come here do this hold that grab this deal with this or that
8320069 well god told me this is the best for our family so i had to take the decision because my husband is not there yet i am praying for him though
8320070 well he is busy with his pursuits and i with the children
8320071 the bible calls debt a curse and children a blessing but in our culture we apply for a curse and reject blessings something is wrong with this picture
8320072 i think its going to be a good marriage us and sioux city this is my seventh olive garden and this is the one im most excited about
8320073 our ancestors who formerly maintained these places loved wisdom and through it they obtained wealth and passed it on to us

8320080 ich fuchtelte damit rum stie es wohl in meiner erregung in den kopf
8320081 die frau hat mich in den hintern gekniffen er grinste mich st ndig dumm an
8320082 leider hatte ich ein messer dabei wollte ihn aber nicht verletzen
8320083 wie ein halb starker kam er an und ging als h tte er rasierklingen unter den achseln
8320084 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8320085 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8320086 we dont know where they are now they moved from the house where they were before because the group fears if localized they could be the target of an attack
8320087 you have 15 to 18 year old guys you give them ak 47s and khat a drug and they have a commander and its an independent gang
8320088 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8320089 this magnificent and unspoiled region is one for which we will demonstrate stewardship on behalf of our own country and all of humanity
8320090 economic and strategic value has risen exponentially in recent years
8320091 the rising global demand for energy and mineral resources has sparked a so called cold rush of countries to the arctic region and with the retreat of the polar ice pack record numbers of ships are plying our northern waters
8320092 canada must therefore move quickly to affirm and protect its sovereignty over the archipelago including the navigable waters within it
8320093 we found out when the lab work started coming back that she died from listeriosis
8320094 by friday evening she was making sounds at that point and then became unconscious after that
8320095 by monday morning we knew it was serious and we know that they were putting antibiotics in her just as fast as they could but they couldnt get the temperature down she wasnt improving it was looking pretty bad
8320096 were angry yes the system failed obviously but as to pointing fingers at who were mad at we just dont we dont know yet at this point
8320097 we have cases of listeriosis every year and they can be attributed to a variety of products
8320098 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper
8320099 as the company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets we have agreed to listen to these parties
8320100 viper is an integral part of this companys heritage while this is a strategic review our intent would be to offer strong operational and financial support during any potential transaction in order to ensure a future for the viper business and perpetuate the legacy of this great vehicle
8320101 its almost like youre writing a book one post at a time
8320102 prices and availability are subject to change at any time offered prices are for base rent only other charges fees terms and conditions may apply
8320103 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8320104 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8320105 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8320106 im reading a course by bernie schaeffer is it a waste of time
8320107 barack and michelle listened and they understood it was like talking with family it became clear that they are regular people
8320108 just bringing people together so real changes can be made that affect the everyday lives of people like me
8320109 joe from next door cannot end life on the earth
8320110 the power and the story how the crafted presidential narrative has determined political success from george washington to george w bush
8320111 you start out with almost an anti intellectual strain there i want someone whos like me so they can understand me and know what i need government to be doing
8320112 to have a bad bowling score is good people see you as human
8320113 no matter how educated you are how successful you are you still need to be just folks
8320114 you want someone who you can say hes like me but i know in a crisis situation he can handle it
8320115 this year one of my goals is not to stress just kind of let life come as it is
8320116 just take things step by step instead of always having a plan
8320117 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
8320118 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
8320119 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
8320120 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
8320121 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
8320122 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
8320123 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
8320124 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
8320125 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
8320126 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
8320127 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
8320128 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
8320129 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
8320130 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
8320131 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
8320132 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
8320133 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
8320134 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
8320135 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
8320136 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
8320137 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
8320138 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
8320139 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
8320140 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
8320141 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8320142 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8320143 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8320144 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8320145 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8320146 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8320147 its a quick complete listings of all the latest celebrity gossip and technology news
8320148 currently under the radar those who have discovered it are self professed addicts
8320149 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8320150 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8320151 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8320152 lo que est en juego en este conflicto es absolutamente esencial
8320153 respeto de la soberan a la independencia y la integridad territorial de georgia en sus fronteras internacionalmente reconocidas
8320154 nos hicieron falta en europa siglos de enfrentamientos y dos guerras mundiales para entender que la paz y la prosperidad se construyen con vecinos cuyos intereses son respetados y tomados en cuenta
8320155 juntos podemos construir un futuro de paz y de prosperidad compartidas
8320156 nadie quiere volver al tiempo de la guerra fr a

8320160 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8320161 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8320162 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
8320163 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
8320164 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
8320165 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
8320166 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government

8320173 confident that the transition to a free and open democracy is being made
8320174 community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage
8320175 so that were not just teaching to a test and crowding out programs like art and music
8320176 i believe the second amendment ought to be preserved which means no gun control

8320183 my thinking is that we should actually try to do things with a social network that is we should consider the social network the model by which we do things
8320184 redhook seasonal craft beers are carefully blended to tie a robust full flavor with a particular time of year late harvest pairs perfectly with the crispness of autumn thanks to its rich complexity of specialty malts
8320185 with our expanded distribution on the west coast craft beer fans across the country can look forward to this seasonal beer every year
8320186 healthy rivers are very important to us at deschutes especially since its one of the main sources we tap into to make great beer if we didnt have clean rivers our beer and the craft beer industry in oregon wouldnt be where it is today
8320187 people also use this as meeting place if conference rooms are booked

8320208 i am sorry for the loss we have all been put through
8320209 my father and i have rescued many people from the tweed bar over the years but it saddens me to say even though i wasnt driving that night i cant see myself returning to the water
8320210 the night in relation to the accident was not a party cruise we were not out lairising
8320211 people need to remember that there were two boats involved that night
8320212 the front of the other boat hit the side of ours and why didnt he stop i drive big boats so i know he felt the impact
8320213 it is common knowledge that you dont use an autopilot in enclosed waters and the most important thing is you drive on the opposite side of the channel to where he was

8320217 although the cause of her death is yet to be determined police are considering the possibility of a drug overdose
8320218 the first death was a 21 year old man at rockhampton on june 9 followed by a 31 year old man at rockhampton on august 2 a 37 year old woman at gladstone on august 5 and a 38 year old man at rockhampton on august 23
8320219 four people died including a 51 year old woman on august 10 a 20 year old man and a 45 year old man on august 12 and a 52 year old man on august 14
8320220 we are very concerned about this spate of drug deaths and overdoses it is unusual
8320221 suddenly hes the champion of a different political party just because he feels bitter about doing so badly in the preselection
8320222 he did badly because he wasnt the sort of person the locals wanted its not like he lost it by one or two votes he lost by a long way

8320471 hello dylan sprouse i see you eveday all time i will have your mssenger
8320472 hello dylan sprouse i see you eveday all time i will have your mssenger
8320473 and there i was buddy doing at least a 100 around the corner
8320474 cmon dad your not still mad at me are you
8320475 he played for me in the 1980s in hamilton alongside grover covington and helped grover become the cfls all time sack leader
8320476 mikes been with washington state the past decade and brings a great deal of expertise on the defensive line were excited to utilize his knowledge to help us in our quest for a grey cup
8320477 hello dylan sprouse i see you eveday all time i will have your mssenger
8320478 we had three to choose from and we took our time weve got an excellent dog were not going to put a puppy out there to fill that collar he is 3 years old he is uga vis son and he is almost full grown 56 5 pounds
8320479 i was the one who helped that mad man come to power because of my selfish desires to have it my way all the time and not vote for the man who partially mirrored my views who happened to be the only real candidate opposing mccain
8320480 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8320481 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8320482 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at five 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8320483 if the government is trying to run out the clock on the 110th congress todays decision suggests that judge bates wont let them

8320487 i cant wait to be a mom and he cant wait to be a dad so its fun
8320488 hes so awesome its fun to have somebody that i love to do this with
8320489 my mom and my grandmother have given me good motherly advice
8320490 but its one of those things where your mother instincts kind of kick in right away
8320491 its just going to be the same as last time mccains gonna steal votes like bush did in florida
8320492 no shit man no way theres gonna be a black president they aint gonna let it happen

8320494 the governments reliance on the internet to disseminate and provide access to information has increased significantly over the years as have the risks associated with potential unauthorized use compromise and loss of the gov domain space
8320495 almost every instance of network communication begins with a request to the domain name system to resolve a human readable name for a network www usa gov into the technical information e g internet protocol address necessary to actually access the remote resource
8320496 signing the top level gov domain is a critical procedure necessary for broad deployment of dnssec increases the utility of dnssec and simplifies lower level deployment by agencies

8320542 this is a big series i have to do something to get it going
8320543 what drivers dont realize is that ethanol is one third less energy per gallon
8320544 so if i have a gallon of gas sitting here and a gallon of ethanol im going to get more energy out of a gallon of gas than on a gallon of ethanol
8320545 virtually every car on the road runs on e10 just fine with no problems whatsoever
8320546 you can immediately go to 14 billion gallons of ethanol without having to worry about infrastructure concerns like the cars engine or gas pumps or anything like that
8320547 so if you have a non ffv and you pump it into your vehicle youre going to have a very serious large expense in front of you to the tune of thousands of dollars vehicles that dont run on e85 if you do pump it into those vehicles the problem is it will corrode the fuel lines the tank the fuel pump destroy the fuel filter etc
8320548 if you are comparing performance and that kind of stuff e85 is an extremely high performance fuel and thats why the indy racing league runs exclusively on ethanol

8320596 the management of the company appear not to be at all concerned about the delivery of quality journalism
8320597 further cuts will erode the newspaper any further depletion of resources will mean that not only staff will be the losers but so will the company the polity and the communities we serve
8320598 there is a new wave appearing at fairfax media which is all about low cost low quality journalism and andrew jaspan is just the first of many people to experience the wrath of the company and to be dismissed

8320609 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8320610 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle

8320618 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8320619 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8320620 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8320621 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8320622 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8320623 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8320624 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8320625 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8320626 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8320627 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8320628 no one works for someone we all just work together
8320629 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8320630 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8320631 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8320632 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8320633 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8320634 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8320635 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8320636 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8320637 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8320638 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8320639 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8320640 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8320641 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8320642 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8320643 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8320644 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8320645 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8320646 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8320647 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8320648 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8320649 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8320650 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8320651 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8320652 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8320653 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8320654 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8320655 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8320656 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8320657 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8320658 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8320659 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

8320671 its like jen is on nothing less than a revenge tour
8320672 while in the past jen shunned publicity and shrank from photographers lenses now shes openly encouraging the attention smiling showing off her body and creating photo ops
8320673 jen was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend
8320674 i am so surprised to hear that question this honestly is the first time ive ever been asked that question im getting married and having children today
8320675 im happy to be here this is one of my favorite places in the world to be i like to watch the conventions on tv i think the stars of the convention should be the people who are being elected

8320694 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8320695 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8320696 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8320705 it will bring a level of control to the market from the point of view of people making a quick profit and getting out and therefore overheating the market
8320706 its trying to eliminate the speculator who purchases stock without having the adequate financial resources to complete the payments should he be unable to sell
8320707 theres an element of overplay and thats the area that the law is trying to address
8320708 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8320709 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8320710 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8320711 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8320712 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8320713 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8320714 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8320715 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8320716 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8320717 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8320718 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8320719 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8320720 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8320721 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8320722 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8320723 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8320724 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8320725 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8320726 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8320727 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8320728 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8320729 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8320730 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8320731 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8320732 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8320733 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8320734 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8320735 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8320736 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8320737 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8320738 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8320739 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8320740 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8320741 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8320742 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8320743 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8320744 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8320745 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8320746 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8320747 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8320748 what happened in permatang pauh was not something so big as to change the situation that exists after the last general election
8320749 this by election is not just life and death for anwar but also for pkr and pakatan rakyat but for bn its just a seat and which did not belong to it but to pkr before the by election
8320750 anwars victory also does not affect the current government leadership pak lah datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi is still the kepala batas member of parliament and prime minister while datuk seri najib razak is still pekan mp and deputy prime minister
8320751 judging from the presence of 50 000 of his supporters on nomination day he should have received about the same number of votes or won by at least a 20 000 vote majority
8320752 but the difference in anwars 15 000 vote majority and his wifes datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail in the last general election is small
8320753 i hope with anwars re entry into parliament the sitting of which will resume tomorrow the proceedings will be more decorous the people want to see the demeanour of someone anwar who aspires to be prime minister and who can set a good example to other parliamentarians especially his colleagues in the opposition
8320754 although it was just a by election it could be an indication of a trend that the voters had already decided that they wanted changes even if they didnt know what the changes were and refused to accept bns leadership
8320755 it is clear that we need to make swift changes to the organisation and to the way we do things
8320756 are fairer not racial based politics but one that is based on the profile of the multiracial and multi religious malaysians
8320757 it may be that whatever is said about anwar the people and voters just refuse to believe it
8320758 the explanation given by our leaders was not accepted as though it was already decided from the outset that the bn would lose and pkr would win
8320759 we must anticipate the problems we may face in the future and be ready to make decisions to counter them
8320760 our people are used to very low cost of living services and food and they are not prepared to face a high cost of living i think we need to learn from countries with a high cost of living how do they survive how do they prosper and how to be competitive
8320761 if we do not do that then i think we cannot achieve vision 2020
8320762 malaysia is the most planned country in the world but people do not follow the plans prepared for them if people had followed the plans we would have been a developed country by now
8320763 fortunate for malaysia we do have an implementation unit and the economic planning unit
8320764 i have spent 22 years trying to change the mindset of the malays for example and i must admit that i have failed in that but people wont give any more time
8320765 people think for a multiracial country we are doing rather well but even then we need to be extremely careful
8320766 sei la luce che illumina le mie notti buie irradi la mia vita di essa sei una stella che brilla di luce propria e ne ragala agli altri ed il mio primo pensiero al mattino e lultimo alla sera

8320771 alcuni dicono che la pioggia brutta ma non sanno che permette di girare a testa alta con il viso coperto dalle lacrime
8320772 e credere in te soltanto giurare in te soltanto riporre in te soltanto la mia fede la mia forza il mio orgoglio tutto il mio mondo tutto quel che sogno e tutto quel che spero
8320773 vorrei tornare bambino perch le ginocchia sbucciate fanno meno male di un cuoreinfranto

8320776 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
8320777 how do you stop the angry person without enough sense
8320778 its not going to take very long for it to be a total massacre
8320779 which risk is more likely that someone is going to accidentally set off a gun in class and god forbid hit a student or someone will come in off the highway and start a random shooting spree
8320780 thats the place people could go if they are feeling crazy or mad at the world and get a big body count
8320781 most high school seniors been huntin on their own since the age of 12
8320782 these are country people they grow up with guns its nothing unusual

8320786 it is my hope and this is your individual decision and there will be no pressure that as many of you will vote for sen obama as possible
8320787 however if you feel you have to vote for sen clinton for closure we will respect that
8320788 if youre a clinton delegate and you cant vote for obama
8320789 i think there are other things out there for me to do and im going to find them
8320790 i think congressman kanjorski has a strong record of helping that part of pennsylvania
8320791 paul has been a good congressman but its going to take him telling people what hes done
8320792 i think barlettas risen to prominence on a very divisive issue and gained attention for himself i dont know what results theres been
8320793 if we go back to our boroughs our cities our townships and our jobs we will be a part of history
8320794 within barack obama there is vision there is direction there is greatness
8320795 when i read about this book i was in the mood for a rock on good romance there were a couple of things that had me worried though the first was ryan sanderson he is a successful quarterback for the denver mavericks making it to the super bowl three times so whats wrong with that im not a sports fan from the beginning force embraces the sport like a fan but she weaves it into the story with a finesse found in a great story teller

8320815 good basically intelligent hardworking decent people and thats my kind of people
8320816 the poisonous and inebriating effects produced in those who drink the liqueur of absinth is undoubtedly due more to the plant than to the alcohol
8320817 the coloring matters used in absinthe are often very deleterious in fact not infrequently copper salts have been used in order to produce the green color
8320818 it is not me who did this please tell me oh god that i have not done this
8320819 absinthe is the principal cause of a series of bloody crimes in our country
8320820 the world around me became crystal clear clear and real in a very surreal way everything appeared clean and perfect and i began to feel as if i were inside a doll house
8320821 while thujone usually occurs in greater concentrations in a absinthium the higher potency thujone is regarded as the primary psychoactive agent
8320822 my peripheral vision seems more like normal vision like where im not looking i am looking i can feel a fuzzy warm feeling around my body not inside but around me like a hazy glow has formed my vision also has a fuzziness to it but i can see quite clearly
8320823 a detectable to major inhibitory effect beyond that of the ethanol content
8320824 alcoholic delirium is characterized by hallucination almost always of a distressing kind is the patient given to absinthe then the symptomatology is different in absinthism the hallucination insanity is more active more terrifying sometimes provoking most dangerous reactions of extreme violence
8320825 i drank till the solid walls of my own room when at last i found myself there appeared to me like transparent glass shot through with emerald flame surrounded on all sides by phantoms beautiful hideous angelic devilish
8320826 the first stage is like ordinary drinking the second when you begin to see monstrous and cruel things but if you can persevere you will enter in upon a third stage where you will see things that you want to see wonderful and curious things
8320827 it is the thujone in wormwood that gives absinthe its hallucinogenic properties
8320828 the higher the thujone level the stronger the psychedelic effect
8320829 people want absinthe to be fearful stuff with the distinctive form of pleasure that fearful things bring
8320830 for me one of the principle attractions of absinthe is that by drinking it one is cocking a snook at new labours nanny culture
8320831 absinthe wont make you trip hallucinate cut your ear off or anything else you wouldnt ordinarily do when intoxicated with liquor
8320832 small ineffective doses may accumulate in the body to the point of having psychoactive and toxic effects if this is the case it validates absinthes reputation for producing an unusual intoxication

8321079 aportando barris de petr leo na empresa fica aparentemente um ind cio de favorecimento ao acionista majorit rio em detrimento do acionista minorit rio que s pode aportar dinheiro
8321080 isso cria uma diferencia o muito grande entre o acionista minorit rio e majorit rio n o vejo com bons olhos essa alternativa
8321081 isso mostra que a desvaloriza o da empresa n o s a queda da commodity reflexo dessa discuss o toda desse disse me disse que s atrapalha a petrobras

8321105 a concert of this nature is not conducive to teach the younger generation to become good citizens upright and competitive but instead would weaken them morally and mentally if the concert organisers do not heed this warning to cancel the concert pas youth will order all muslim youth to turn up and protest the concert in order to prevent it from taking place
8321106 our mission is to put a smile on the face of a child in the time of need
8321107 with wings and a halo r e a c h a child
8321108 ive shut up about this long enough samantha is using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some los angeles dj and now shes writing a book i am at my wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realises who the people using her are
8321109 samantha drinks and passes the drinks under the table to lindsay and behind the scenes it gets worse and worse
8321110 my daughter isnt working because shes always with sam even my ex wife knows it she just isnt doing anything about it
8321111 i want you to staaaaaay mummy i want you to stay
8321112 im going to assume the first comment set the tone here right
8321113 give me a break this whole thing is the biggest fairy tale ive ever seen
8321114 suck as much as 130 00 off city tax rolls
8321115 were not waiting around for you any more were going to go ahead and lease the 100 000 sq ft you were going to use
8321116 my parents always taught me to put others before myself
8321117 what specialist roy did was really remarkable and shows how much of a good guy he really is
8321118 soldiers usually take deployment money and spend it on themselves i was surprised by how much money came out of his pocket
8321119 i figured if people saw me giving back it would encourage them to do the same
8321120 when they see a soldier trying to give back when they are already selflessly serving their country they want to be a part of it as well
8321121 to know that you can make a profound difference in someones life is a wonderful feeling
8321122 i got a letter of thanks from the first child and her mother that i sponsored through make a wish and she said she was moved to tears by my kindness theres no feeling like that its hard to put in words how that made me feel
8321123 shes always shared a bedroom and her older sister just moved out so were making her a place she can call her own
8321124 an educational experience for them they are learning about iraq and what the soldiers are doing here to make things better
8321125 i spent the day with them answering questions and playing at recesses
8321126 it was a great experience it only takes a few minutes every couple of weeks to write a small letter to let them know how things are going they looked at me with such awe i was really touched to be a part of their lives
8321127 there were bullet holes everywhere and i saw a lot of burned down houses
8321128 the kids would come up and ask for money i talked a lot to our translator about the country everyone liked us being there it felt good we were down there for a good cause ive spoken to bosnian forces serving with us here they said its gotten a lot better
8321129 they go out meet people personally and give back in a real way to these local communities
8321130 the prt at camp echo has a program to rebuild schools and the local infrastructure while also giving school children brand new laptops

8321141 this provides the wireless industrys smallest and most cost effective solution for basic wimax coverage and signal quality assessment
8321142 electrification will happen in the next few years and it will change the semiconductor landscape
8321143 anything that aims at reducing co 2 is beneficial for the electronics industry
8321144 the semiconductor content of these vehicles is significantly higher than in conventionally driven cars
8321145 with a power demand of several kilowatts this compressor is normally driven directly by the cars engine by means of a belt transmission now it can be connected to the high voltage circuit which leads to increased efficiency
8321146 the two drives need to switch over seamlessly this is where oems and tier ones can create the added value for their respective brand
8321147 we are focusing more on the charge management and see a huge potential in the analog mixed signal parts used in the dc dc and ac dc converters
8321148 we know that suboptimal speed behavior leads to increased fuel consumption
8321149 if this factor is considered in the program of the acc it can optimize the fuel efficiency
8321150 i dont really know want it is you wish to show but i do know that is what you need to be studying
8321151 ill design and conduct the study and then collect the data and if you like what the statistical analysis reveals ill write it up
8321152 ser un partido muy fuerte porque todo el mundo ha crecido en el f tbol venezuela as ha sido entonces va a ser complicado
8321153 well then its a great time for us to meet and get you prepared for when you do
8321154 are you slightly retarded do you understand that if you arent hiring currently then now is the time to develop your talent strategy no didnt think so thats why you need me you idiot
8321155 well i just learned of this they gave me no warning
8321156 well if we had prepared all of this stuff beforehand all wed have to do is put the wheels in motion but now you know for next time
8321157 whats happened has happened theres no use crying about it

8321160 if anyone doubts my motivation they can be sure of this i want to win now more than ever
8321161 it does seem that the street circuits havent been favourable to me in four races ive only claimed one point in melbourne in a race i didnt manage to finish because of an engine failure
8321162 then there was the incident with adrian sutil in monaco and hamilton crashing into me at the exit to the pit lane in montreal
8321163 we will be closely watching the race in district 93 because it is between a um student steve dogiakos and former um professor richard barrett which should be a fun race to watch
8321164 if its so damn funny why the hell are you asking how funny it is
8321165 the news worries me because it seems that the team is not going to be what it is today
8321166 it worries me yes but i am concentrated on the game on saturday i do not want the team to forget about it i want them to be concentrated
8321167 the circumstances of soccer are thus and you expect that there can be more movements
8321168 if two or three go then two or three footballers of the same quality and same profile have to come in
8321169 la gente pensa che la vita sia una strada dritta ma sbaglia la vita un circolo un maledetto cerchio che gira in tondo alla fine ti ritrovi in mano esattamente quello che avevi allinizio e finisci per tornare al luogo da cui sei venuto
8321170 mi rimasto cos poco a cui aggrapparmi e non voglio che mi venga tolto
8321171 ti sbagli la realt ce li strappa a uno a uno
8321172 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8321173 certo certo e ci che vuoi che io pensi e quando mi sveglie sar molto peggio se mi sveglier il che non avverr perch sono gi morta
8321174 capisco che tu possa avermi scambiato per un incubo ma non riesco a immaginare cosa potresti aver fatto di tanto brutto per finire allinferno ne hai ammazzati molti in mia assenza
8321175 ho pensato che se proprio devo andare allinferno tanto vale andarci in grande stile
8321176 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro lorizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8321177 non sono sicura che al mondo esistano abbastanza rose bianche da farmi dimenticare richard
8321178 prima di te la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora all improvviso tutto ha preso fuoco c era luce c era bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8321179 come una droga per te bella ormai ho capito che senza di lui non puoi vivere troppo tardi ma io sarei stato una scelta pi sana non una droga io sarei stato laria il sole
8321180 anchio ne ero convinta sai eri come un sole il mio sole personale il rimedio migliore alle nuvole
8321181 i wish one day you would tell me you have some secret real loving feelings for me instead of just the sex talk all the time i have never let anyone use me like i let you i know i am worth more than just sex yet i always crawl back to you each and every time you are my weakness should i forgive myself for letting someone blatantly take advantage of me
8321182 a passer by might have mistaken it for a lost father son reunion
8321183 initially there was tension between us but as we chatted about this and that and became more relaxed i discovered that he was a human being after all
8321184 we chatted about family about my mother as well as about politics and the talks mugabe ate a lot and knew exactly what he wanted he is very alert mentally but physically the age is telling
8321185 i got the impression that he has a deep commitment to his legacy i realised that he actually believes a lot of what he is saying its not all said just for propaganda purposes he is paranoid about the british i think overall he wants to prove to them that he is right
8321186 i said why dont you talk to them and he said well you know blair was bad enough but this brown he is even worse
8321187 at one point mugabe told me you know some people say im a murderer but im not let the two of us carry on eating together and showing that we can go forward in peace
8321188 it felt like a remarkably normal conversation most of the time apart from his denial of the violence in zimbabwe
8321189 he seemed to be unaware or he feigned ignorance of the atrocities committed by his own people i wondered if he was suppressing knowledge of something he was not comfortable with right up to the end of the dinner i kept coming back to the issue of violence and he kept denying any knowledge of it
8321190 i left the hotel wondering why mugabe is so violent why does he resort to violence whenever he is cornered being in his company i couldnt imagine where the violent streak was i think he suppresses it even to himself or is it the people around him he doesnt seem as bad when youre with him but i know he was trying to manipulate me that night
8321191 i actually have to admit that i have some respect for mugabe who used to be my hero
8321192 we are in love so we should get married even though we are 15 over undertone
8321193 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8321194 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8321195 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8321196 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8321197 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8321198 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8321199 pap volevo sapere se mi potevi dare un passaggio a scuola perch sono in ritardo
8321200 cassy perch non usi il tuo motorino che ti ho regalato
8321201 cassy devi superare questo dramma devi iniziare a usare quel motorino non ti potr sempre portarti a spasso con la mia macchina

8321212 dani scusa per la sfuriata di stamattina forse hai ragione

8321216 se tutto il resto perisse e lui rimanesse io continuerei a esistere
8321217 i held you in my hand wanderer and you were so beautiful
8321218 we are pleased to resolve our outstanding dispute with microsoft and to put this litigation behind us
8321219 we are pleased to have reached a resolution to our legal dispute with immersion that includes a 20 75 million payment to microsoft we are gratified that we have successfully resolved our claims under the 2003 settlement we negotiated with immersion which provided benefits to both companies and specific rights to microsoft
8321220 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8321221 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8321222 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8321223 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8321224 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8321225 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8321226 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8321227 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8321228 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8321229 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8321230 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8321231 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8321232 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8321233 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8321234 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8321235 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8321236 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8321237 cant get overly excited by a down in the situation right now because this process does go up and down
8321238 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8321239 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8321240 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8321241 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8321242 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8321243 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8321244 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8321245 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8321246 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8321247 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8321248 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8321249 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8321250 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8321251 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8321252 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8321253 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8321254 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8321255 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8321256 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8321257 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8321258 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8321259 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the
8321260 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8321261 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8321262 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8321263 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8321264 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8321265 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8321266 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8321267 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8321268 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8321269 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8321270 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8321271 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8321272 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8321273 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8321274 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8321275 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8321277 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8321278 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8321279 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8321280 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8321281 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8321282 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8321285 i couldnt say because if someone has promised me to cheslea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8321286 im kidding of course ive always said that im happy at milan and as long as i have the same objectives as milan ill stay here
8321287 thats the way its always been my aim is to win and thats the same with milan as you can see by the effort theyve made in that direction strengthening the squad in such a way that this will always be a team of winners
8321288 people say were not interested in winning the uefa cup this group has won everything we could possibly win
8321289 our main aim is to win the scudetto i think inter milan will be the team to beat given what theyve done these last few years
8321290 then of course juve whove bought well this year theyll also be playing in the champions league and could have a great season
8321291 and then theres always as roma who are a team that play great football these will be our rivals throughout the season but there are always surprises
8321292 fiorentina are a team that have been playing together for some time now and last season they had a great year and they could repeat that
8321293 and then well see if there are any other surprise packages

8321303 i needed to do it and thats the way it went lets make it real clear im not apologizing for it and thats it
8321304 just think about this in four month well have an administration that actually believes in science
8321305 one question really was her heart in it do you think
8321306 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8321307 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8321308 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8321309 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8321310 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8321311 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8321312 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8321313 all the parts of the internet are on the iphone

8321325 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8321326 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going some place else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be

8321350 these are the earliest copies of the bible ever found
8321351 the bible is sacred to us and to you and to all the monotheistic religions and therefore the scrolls are national treasures and world treasures and therefore it is our duty to preserve them at least for 2 000 years more
8321352 they show the connection between christianity judaism and how everything evolved from the god the god is one god

8321356 should u s taxpayer money go to places like africa to fund contraception to prevent aids
8321357 well i think its a combination the guy i really respect on this is dr coburn he believes and i was just reading the thing he wrote that you should do what you can to encourage abstinence where there is going to be sexual activity where that doesnt succeed than he thinks that we should employ contraceptives as well but i agree with him that the first priority is on abstinence i look to people like dr coburn im not very wise on it
8321358 so no contraception no counseling on contraception just abstinence do you think contraceptives help stop the spread of hiv

8321484 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8321485 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8321486 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people
8321487 and you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8321488 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8321489 when barack obama is in the white house hell revitalize our economy defend the working people of america and meet the global challenges of our time
8321490 democrats know how to do this as i recall we did it before with president clinton and the democrats and if we do our part well do it again with president obama and the democrats
8321491 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis john mccain wants to privatize social security and in 2008 he still thinks its okay when women dont earn equal pay for equal work
8321492 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8321493 this race is all about the future and thats why we must elect barack obama
8321494 in four months we will have an administration that actually believes in science

8321497 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like mine did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities that they never had themselves
8321498 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values like you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do and that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
8321499 michelle had one job ahead of her she had to portray her husband barack obama as a hard working ordinary american citizen that americans could believe in
8321500 she hit a home run she really kept it real had personal stories to share stories about bringing their daughter home from the hospital stories about him talking to the community it was her job to focus on him and she did a good job

8321519 wahai rabbku penjara lebih aku sukai daripada memenuhi ajakan mereka kepadaku dan jika tidak engkau hindarkan diriku dari tipu daya mereka tentu aku akan cenderung untuk memenuhi keinginan mereka dan tentulah aku termasuk orang orang yang bodoh

8321543 research on identity within the field of psychology should broaden its focus to include a wider unit of analysis than the solitary individual

8321545 although several groups have documented that repeated cocaine exposure increases nac spine density the precise molecular mechanisms that control this process have remained elusive
8321546 moreover the cocaine induced increase in nac spine density has been hypothesized to contribute to the long lasting behavioral sensitization that occurs after repeated cocaine exposure but direct evidence concerning the functional relationship between these two processes is lacking
8321547 taken together our findings implicate mef2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing mef2 activity and thereby increasing spine density in the nac may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine
8321548 a better understanding of the mef2 associated molecular mechanisms that regulate cocaine induced structural and behavioral plasticity could ultimately lead to the development of improved treatments for drug addiction

8321563 we are gravely concerned about the fate of these three bahais who are being held without charges in a case that is clearly based on religious persecution
8321564 although the three have lived in yemen for more than 25 years they hold iranian passports and we have come to believe that the yemeni government may be planning to deport them to iran where the government is waging a systematic campaign against bahais
8321565 while calling for their immediate release our primary concern today is to ask that the yemeni government resist any impulse to deport these three bahais to iran or any other country deportation to any country for three individuals with well established businesses and families for their religious beliefs would be grossly unjust but deportation to iran where they face the possibility of torture would be a clear violation of international human rights law

8321608 so many things have happened to me as a player and as a manager that i would never take anything for granted it was disappointing at the time but it was two years ago
8321609 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted
8321610 i would have said only a few weeks ago i was resigned myself to the fact he would no longer be here around about the time we played reading in a friendly and when he didnt come with us to malaga
8321611 if he does stay i will be delighted it will be a really big bonus for us
8321612 i think gareth has played four games in quick succession with the one for england four in 12 days after a stop start pre season which hasnt helped him
8321613 he will have better days for us than on saturday at stoke with a bit of luck but saturday might just have been a culmination of the four games in quick succession the lack of any steady pre season and all of those things
8321614 i couldnt have faulted him in any of the matches he had played for us before that

8321626 the democratic choice is between sticking with an anticarbon theology that opposes all new drilling or siding with american consumers who want more energy supplies so they dont have to pay 4 for gas and blow their family budget to keep the lights on well soon find out whether democrats have found religion on drilling or if theyre merely doing an election year incantation

8321633 in many instances reporters and news teams are sent to dangerous assignments without adequate preparation support and equipment
8321634 we believe that the dismal working conditions of journalists and media workers are also attacks on press freedom similar to threats and killings of members of the media

8321705 then there is senate resolution 262 it designated july 2007 as national watermelon month
8321706 if our congress is going to praise dirt it ought to praise the stuff that grows in it
8321707 that brings us to senate resolution 180 it recognized the 70th anniversary of the idaho potato commission it also designated may 2007 as idaho potato month
8321708 if congress is going to praise watermelon why not the potato you cant make fries out of watermelons surely the democrat congress passed the key spending bills that keep our government running
8321709 you refer to the 13 separate appropriation bills that congress must pass and the president must sign to fund all the departments and activities of the federal government our congress didnt pass even one of the 2009 appropriation bills even though that is one of its primary responsibilities
8321710 how will the democrats running congress fund the government then
8321711 theyll likely wait until the last minute then combine all 13 spending bills into one massive bill what they call an omnibus bill politicians love omnibus bills because they can sneak in all kinds of goodies before anybody notices
8321712 surely the democrats running congress passed important legislation of some kind
8321713 well they passed the largest expansion in college aid in 60 years increased the minimum wage extended unemployment benefits passed a 168 billion stimulus package and also passed a 300 billion mortgage bill to bail out individuals and finance companies that made boneheaded decisions
8321714 theyre even better at spending dough than republicans but surely they tackled some of the really important stuff how about allowing more drilling where we know the oil is so america can produce more of its own oil and gas what about doing something about the nutty ethanol policies that are driving up food costs
8321715 they didnt get around to such things but they did designate june 30th as national corvette day
8321716 hey guys with toupees should have their own day too
8321717 to be fair the democrat congress is up against a republican president who is blocking its efforts to pass the democrats ideas into law back in 1995 when clinton was president and the house and senate were republican not many bills got passed into law either that session of congress was almost as unproductive as our current one
8321718 its generally a good thing when congress is unproductive gridlock is good the democrats in congress have lots of ambitious ideas to grow the government increase regulation and increase taxes god help us if the voters give them a democrat president to pass their ideas into law
8321719 we should celebrate the fact that the democrats in congress have got so little done we should be grateful congress is limited to passing meaningless resolutions such as decreeing may 5 9 as national substitute teacher recognition week
8321720 but we should praise our substitute teachers howd you like it if your career choice involved spitballs in your hair and laxatives slipped into your coffee
8321721 the approval provides us with tremendous new global opportunities in both listed and over the counter derivatives markets and further enhances the cme groups leading position in global financial markets

8321723 looking at the parts we are playing im very concerned about what you think of us
8321724 like george im not sure if i should be flattered or insulted
8321725 have you seen the film and you call that a love letter
8321726 we started writing the movie as kind of an exercise thinking of what kind of parts these actors might play what kind of story they might inhabit
8321727 its really a funny script i didnt feel any need to wander off the script
8321728 he doesnt consider any other possibility other than what he thinks will happen i pretty much ran with that
8321729 theres something really really funny in terms of my character being so angry all the time
8321730 im sort of happy to be here it is one of my favorite places
8321731 the stars of the convention should be the people who are being elected
8321732 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8321733 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing but it was just the best way to go
8321734 i was deciding do i want to have another baby
8321735 thats when matthew was conceived we had tried for 16 years and no baby so matthew was a big surprise
8321736 fight for basic human equality providing a basis for more realistic outreach
8321737 pressure on human rights issues such as the criminalization of homosexuality could help bring those at risk out of the shadows
8321738 without political will and education many will never know how to stop aids effectively
8321739 shift in u s policy would also acknowledge that the fight against hiv is also a fight for basic human equality providing a basis for more realistic outreach
8321740 prevention program that doesnt acknowledge that fact will have faltered before it begins
8321741 some insured patients are being asked by hospitals to pay larger portions of their bills upfront and sometimes hospitals will not do the procedures until they get their copayments
8321742 can be withheld depending on a patients ability to pay
8321743 as the economy worsens employers are having a harder time affording insurance for their employees theyre increasing the patient portions and patients benefits actually decrease
8321744 i am happy that aids related deaths have decreased by over 75 over the last four years in comparison with aids related deaths we had in 2003 to 2004 because of increased free treatment
8321745 this represents a 67 survival rate but we still need to do more because those who did not make it may have died because they started the treatment late or did not have access to proper nutrition
8321746 we help people if they have no food if their lights are going to be shut off all of the things that would keep people from getting medication
8321747 i completely support breastfeeding and i think breast milk is the perfect food and the healthiest way to nourish an infant however were finding so many mothers are vitamin d deficient themselves that the milk is therefore deficient so many babies cant keep their levels up
8321748 they may start their lives vitamin d deficient and then all theyre getting is vitamin d deficient breast milk
8321749 in 2007 at least 26 states made efforts to expand coverage but as the economy has turned downward so have state efforts
8321750 reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy too many of our neighbors are living in poverty and too many are living without health insurance
8321751 todays news confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
8321752 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of schip over president bushs two vetoes
8321753 are expensive and when tax revenues fall it is going to be harder to keep them up
8321754 we have a much weaker economy than a year ago much higher inflation very unlikely that this trend will continue into 2008
8321755 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8321756 states such as massachusetts have also played an important role in stemming the rising tide of uninsured and thanks to their health reform law they now have one of the lowest uninsured rates
8321757 but 45 7 million uninsured people are far too many and we need a national solution to this crisis
8321758 this is unconscionable and an affront to every american taxpayer who is footing the bill especially because we are not talking about millions of dollars
8321759 instead we are talking billions of dollars lost to fraud waste and or abuse in 2006

8321868 possiamo dirlo perch lanno scorso non ho potuto offrire prestazioni di altissimo livello ma presto per parlare di questanno ho giocato soltanto una partita di sicuro stato un buon inizio lanno scorso devo dimenticarlo in fretta a causa degli infortuni ma abbiamo finito vincendo lo scudetto gi domenica si vista una bella inter carica concentrata decisa a fare bene
8321869 quando ti cerca un grandissimo club fa piacere ho ringraziato tutti i ragazzi per i complimenti che mi hanno fatto e anche il mister ranieri quando lho incontrato a torino la sera del trofeo tim ma ero sicuro di rimanere perch ho ancora tanto da dare allinter
8321870 io non ho violato le regole a essere suo amico

8321872 non avevo mai sentito nessuno della societ che la pensasse cos erano solo voci dei giornalisti che mi hanno caricato su un treno che partito mi hanno fatto tanta pubblicit si parlato tanto di me per diverse settimane ma come vedete sono rimasto bastata una telefonata con la societ per chiarire tutto
8321873 si visto subito che era un grandissimo allenatore non mi era mai capitato in 13 14 anni di carriera di svolgere tutta la preparazione in campo a parte la prima settimana in cui vai in difficolt poi voli lui aggiunge ti fa sentire importante e questo significa che sta contando su di te mi ha levato anche un peso di dosso quello delle voci di mercato ndr da quel momento hanno smesso di dire che me ne andavo
8321874 no siamo tranquilli ci sono tante squadre che si sono rinforzate e che hanno comprato bravi giocatori sar dura ma noi come sempre puntiamo a tutti gli obiettivi come abbiamo sempre fatto nelle ultime stagioni

8321887 some of the players were feeling flat due to the amount of rugby they have played
8321888 theres a few guys who played each and every minute of the super 14 and most of the test matches too you can see they are a bit flat and the decision making is just not there
8321889 i havent felt flat you cant speak for the opposition but where were at were all feeling fresh
8321890 it is a tough and intense competition but i think weve got the balance right and the guys do feel fresh they are looking forward to training and looking forward to games i havent experienced that flatness
8321891 one of our biggest strengths is the impact our bench has been giving to the team
8321892 weve got a squad of 30 the whole squad trains and everyone gets an opportunity to train in their position and everyone gets equal time in their positions
8321893 i think that certainly has a positive effect when the interchange players come on they feel comfortable in their roles they just go out and want to play good football and thats what theyve been doing
8321894 previously in a lot of teams youd probably focus on the starting xv making sure they get enough time in their positions but now everyone is getting that equal time and equal opportunity and that is certainly paying dividends for us
8321895 the good thing is that the guys are always prepared to come on in the first minute or the 58th minute

8322146 its complicated by unfamiliarity inexperience and rumors our job is to make sure people know who barack obama is and what he stands for
8322147 because they dont want to vote for mccain and theyre disillusioned by bushs economic policies
8322148 i dont see any evidence of remorse or concern for anyone but himself

8322211 how dare you be so discriminatory why cant i hire a white guy if hes the best qualified
8322212 i found a woman who was a better candidate than the guy i wanted to hire first
8322213 so why the hell didnt you find them in the first place you claimed that you carefully searched for the very best candidate and you shouted at me about how awful it was that i couldnt let you hire them but the moment you had to look at women candidates you found someone better than your very best candidate

8322221 first of all i dont agree with giving an opioid antidote to non medical professionals thats no 1
8322222 sometimes having an overdose being in an emergency room having that contact with a health care professional is enough to make a person snap into the reality of the situation and snap into having someone give them services

8322257 it was a full scale riot bottles were flying everywhere carnival goers and police officers were bloodied a policewoman was carried off unconscious
8322258 another had a two inch gash above his eye he was staggering and supported by two colleagues the mob werent scared they were running towards the police who were chanting one two three and charging them it was like a war zone i havent seen anything like it at the carnival since the early nineties it reminded me of the brixton riots
8322259 i heard people screaming and swearing so i came outside he was lying on the ground on his back with his head on the side there was blood all on his face
8322260 they chased him up the road like a pack of dogs yelling and screaming they were kicking and punching and swinging at him there were two stab wounds on his upper back
8322261 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
8322262 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
8322263 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8322264 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8322265 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8322266 i was so glad to find a safe place and someone to love me but its gone now you dont love me anymore please dont beat me
8322267 i didnt even know i won this tournament thats how long it has been
8322268 well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
8322269 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was real mad
8322270 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8322271 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8322272 she never really answered the key question is he prepared to be president which is the issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries
8322273 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america
8322274 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8322275 im sad that were not standing here talking about her running for president but we have to abide by her wishes
8322276 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana
8322277 im going to make sure im here personally to lead the preparation efforts and if necessary any recovery efforts necessary after the fact

8322281 subjects systematically favored the prosocial option provided their partner was a familiar b visible and c receiving rewards of equal value
8322282 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
8322283 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices
8322284 today the attorneys are going in front of judge larson and hes going to make his ruling on that because we feel its not a 100 million its 20 because they were duplicated
8322285 are you ready for victory then you must be ready for unity that is the only way we are going to win and have this victory
8322286 im going to cast my vote for senator obama if hillary clinton says shes going to cast her vote for senator obama
8322287 you could argue that no ones every ready to be president
8322288 my horse is out of the race im getting out to work for obama
8322289 i think there are a few delegates who need to vote for hillary to reach that point of closure
8322290 the story is that we are working as a team

8322297 merlin was scared to death of her didnt know what to do
8322298 it took two years of catching her in her breeding cycle putting merlin with her every day during her cycle coaching him along and stopping her from being aggressive toward him
8322299 id stand there with a net and defend him and when he was doing well give him nuts
8322300 also id give her treats to calm her down so shed sit there and eat rather than attack him
8322301 we respect your viewpoint but we also respect the vision of the filmmaker and decided to use live animals
8322302 must be tricked sedated or forcibly restrained when the infants are pulled from them and this cruel practice leaves lifelong emotional scars
8322303 chimps should be with their mothers for the first five years
8322304 were a nonprofit were not staffed to do that kind of comprehensive oversight
8322305 if we are witnessing good care thats our focus to make the assumption that when they leave the set they will treat the animals differently is not something we do animals need consistency if youre treating an animal in training with positive rewards then youre not going to come to the set and beat it with a stick and expect the same results
8322306 no animals were harmed in the making of this film
8322307 with great apes were asking them to add that the aha is not present for the training of great apes prior to the animals being on the set
8322308 people have a false sense that because the aha is on set during a movie that disclaimer means that everything is ok its not
8322309 i saw a lot of physical violence a lot of punching and kicking and the use of the ugly stick a sawed off broom handle to beat the chimps the youngest i met were 18 months old and were pretty similar to an 18 month old human child they were being kicked in the face and punched in the head and subject to all kinds of physical abuse to keep them paying attention and in line with the trainer
8322310 its very similar to an abusive human relationship the bottom line is chimps are super strong and super curious and super smart and the amount of control that the trainers require to keep them paying attention and not misbehaving its too much to be able to do with love and kisses the way the trainers are able to control them is behind the scenes they have this very brutal relationship including discipline when they misbehave and random violence without any seeming provocation that keeps their attention on the trainer
8322311 the violence begins at birth and the chimps live so long
8322312 i dont know how to explain it the idea of these individuals stuck in a cage with nowhere to go and to keep them in those cages for decades
8322313 i just couldnt imagine that chimps have self awareness and understand where theyre at
8322314 there was this look in his eyes he had such kind eyes it just spoke to me
8322315 and then knowing his history in labs that just solidified for me what a sanctuary can do for chimps
8322316 i see the retirement community idea as simply another ploy by the animal rights community to reach their eventual goal of abolishing the use of animals in research im not opposed to it but i think it is being driven by an animal rights point of view
8322317 he researched it very carefully he knew what he was getting into its a commitment you make for life they dont go away to college
8322318 there was no point in intervening again we cannot keep on taking away children from a mother
8322319 claudio died in his mothers arms we think from some heart defect
8322320 on wednesday he gave the impression to keepers that he wasnt feeling to well
8322321 on friday he wasnt eating or drinking properly and seemed to be growing weaker
8322322 we were keeping a close eye on him but suddenly on saturday morning he died
8322323 its a monkey its not like it did anything bad

8322486 billy has looked pretty good so far in camp and has really improved as a quarterback
8322487 his throwing motion has improved he is throwing a better ball and his arm strength on the whole looks to have increased significantly
8322488 he has excellent perimeter speed and has gotten stronger in the off season
8322489 brent catches the ball very well out of the backfield so he has some talent as a receiver
8322490 as a runner he is very good at pushing his momentum ahead and falling forward
8322491 matt is a go to guy for us a big target who has deceivingly good speed
8322492 he is one of our best players not just on offense but on the team as well
8322493 jake is probably the top athlete not only on the football team but at the entire school
8322494 he is very polished and can be a major force on the offensive side of the ball as well as special teams
8322495 traves has been kind of bothered by a hamstring injury here in camp but hell be 100 percent very soon
8322496 he is in the mold of a shannon sharpe he can block well and has very good speed
8322497 were dominated by upperclassmen on our defense so our players know whats going on its not new to them
8322498 i am very excited about the style of defense that our kids play their intensity and their enthusiasm that goes along with having good skill and makes for a good defense
8322499 john has excellent quickness and a nose for the ball
8322500 he is a very intense player probably the most intense player ive ever coached
8322501 miller is a very smart player very heady and does a good job of being a leader out there keeping things calm
8322502 hes probably our most explosive player and a guy who really the skys the limit for what he can accomplish this year as a pass rusher and an overall linebacker
8322503 hes a guy thats very good both against the run and in passing situations
8322504 hes definitely a high motor guy a senior one of the leaders down there
8322505 i believe keith has the potential to be the best corner in the conference
8322506 he played last year as a part time starter and really probably could have been a full time starter he has great athletic ability but this year hes learned to develop a work ethic and just become a better all around player
8322507 hes a very physical player very good against the run and even though hes only about 165 pounds hes probably one of our best hitters on the team
8322508 he should really be a big time playmaker for us this year
8322509 we expect him to be a centerfielder back there just to kind of roam make plays just be an overall athlete
8322510 if things go the way we want to and we make the playoffs thats the caliber of team were going to have to get used to playing in the first round
8322511 its a great test for where were at and a great test to give us an early peek at what a playoff caliber team would be like
8322512 im super stoked to be on board the crew at porters is all about having a good time and sharing their passion of tahoe and snowboarding

8322526 it comes from within i feel we can advance if we handle the stress we must start the match believing we can do it and we have to channel this belief in our game
8322527 with the help of our fans we can get the result that will take us into the group stage
8322528 we must be patient and hopefully well be luckier than two weeks ago in cyprus
8322529 we may have won the first game 3 0 but we have a really tough second leg ahead
8322530 obviously our lead is healthy but we need to work even harder if we want to get to the group stage i want those who take the field against olympiacos to use all their strength to achieve our ultimate dream were close but the game that stands in our way is very tough

8322586 for our group being able to skate with these guys it shows the maturity and what it takes to advance in this league
8322587 theres a number of players who would love to have a pro opportunity these guys have put in the work and have been rewarded for it
8322588 i think its a reflection of the organization and how much these guys have enjoyed their time here in moose jaw and in the community in general
8322589 to have these guys leave their home cities to come back at their own expense to be a part of it i think thats something special in itself
8322590 langer gave me a call and asked me if i wanted to come back and immediately i said yes
8322591 i have a lot of friends here and its awesome to see them its a good experience and good ice
8322592 its tough in the summer to find really high tempo ice like this and thats what i want to have heading into camp with san jose
8322593 that was a good typical dave hunchak hard working practice
8322594 its a big hurdle that weve overcome and hopefully they can continue to move forward with the project
8322595 i think its time now that the community and everyone involved all start pulling in the same direction
8322596 i think any time you have a project of this magnitude youre never going to please everybody
8322597 i think the disappointing thing in the whole process is that it took two years and when we were able to come to the decision that the city made we still had people trying to find ways to pull the project down and prevent it from moving forward
8322598 las fotos de las instalaciones de pista de los equipos jamaiquinos me atrapan pero lo que prueban tal vez es que todo el esto y lo otro de la alta tecnolog a no pueden tomar el lugar del poder puro del esp ritu humano

8322600 nowhere in that speech did she answer the question about his character his ability to lead the things that are at issue here

8322602 barack obama is a charming and fine person with a lovely family but hes not ready to be president
8322603 go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks and send some to those who have nothing prepared this day is sacred to our lord do not grieve for the joy of the lord is your strength
8322604 how do we use our strengths to minister for god when he works best through weakness
8322605 we dont have a lot of time to unite the democratic party
8322606 that which historically divides us cannot divide us if we want barack obama to be president of the united states im not going to be satisfied until i see rod blagojevich give michael madigan a hug
8322607 i have been trying to get to know mayor daley for 14 years i only see mayor daley at the conventions and i only talk to him through the press
8322608 i have been trying to get to know him but that is what conventions are about
8322609 so i dont know whether it is genuine or not
8322610 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8322611 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8322612 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8322613 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8322614 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8322615 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8322616 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8322617 the night was terrifying and difficult i thank the libyan authorities for their efforts which allowed us to be freed
8322618 we condemned the hijacking and we have appealed to the international community to condemn it as well
8322619 the hijackers claim to have coordinated with him nur to join him in paris
8322620 we dont have any relation with that hijacking civilians theyre angry theyll behave like that they may agree with abdul wahid nur but in our structure we have no decision like this to hijack a civilian airplane

8322622 i think were also seeing growing speculation of bank of england rate cuts
8322623 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft
8322624 it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
8322625 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
8322626 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
8322627 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
8322628 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
8322629 the first thing we do in these situation is divert to safety take the safety first option

8322949 what you really want is a missing cell type one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else but you only want that cell type so i think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work by this gene over expression procedure
8322950 provides exciting new insights into yet another aspect of cell plasticity that was not appreciated previously and that offers great potential therapeutically direct reprogramming represents a more straight forward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell
8322951 more than a little surprised to find that we could use a combination of just three transcription factors to reprogram one cell type into another
8322952 combined a systematic approach to identifying the relevant transcription factors hard work and a bit of luck
8322953 by asking what genes you have to have turned on in the cell for it to become a beta cell
8322954 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind
8322955 and the locks are transcription factors we asked which ones are present in the beta cell and that gave us 1 100 transcription factors to choose from eventually we learned that of the 1 100 only about 200 are actually expressed in cells that are involved in forming the pancreas
8322956 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8322957 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8322958 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
8322959 were intrigued by the possibility that this approach which has worked for pancreatic insulin producing cells could be more widely applied to many kind of cells especially those that are lost in disease or following injury
8322960 and at the same time we are exploring the possibility of using this general approach in a clinical context to make new beta cells for patients

8323073 poor sleep can affect a students grades increase emotional behavioral disturbance
8323074 students reported sleeping on average 7 6 hours per school night with 48 percent reporting less than eight hours hours of sleep per school night were significantly positively associated with gpa and level of motivation and significantly negatively associated with clinically significant levels of emotional disturbance and adhd each additional hour of sleep on school nights lowered the odds of scoring in the clinically significant range of emotional disturbance and adhd by 25 percent and 34 percent respectively
8323075 by activating dopamine receptors we found that some behaviours in the mouse model of fragile x disease can be repaired or improved so this suggests dopamine related drugs could work as a treatment for patients with fragile x syndrome

8323098 as is usually the case the obama people were right
8323099 no i never intended to come here i had laid out matters otherwise in my mind i thought i should contrive well for myself i thought my scheme good i intended to take effectual care but it came upon me unexpected i did not look for it at that time and in that manner it came as a thief death outwitted me gods wrath was too quick for me oh my cursed foolishness i was flattering myself and pleasing myself with vain dreams of what i would do hereafter and when i was saying peace and safety then sudden destruction came upon me

8323106 this is like you coming out here and trying to accomplish something and someone is saying something horrible about you and its painful
8323107 we kind of felt that it was saying that we were doing something illegal
8323108 instead they removed some positive postings they refused to remove the bad posting and then they called me to solicit a business account
8323109 i felt like that was really unfair and that they were holding me hostage
8323110 a customer had written a negative review so about a week after that yelp contacted us and said we noticed that you had some negative reviews and we would like to help you with that if you pay 350 a month
8323111 all of a sudden some more negative reviews got posted but there were no favorable or positive reviews

8323135 the launch of the artsprojekt community together with the on demand skateboard platform provides a truly amazing opportunity for this market segment

8323137 as a pro skateboarder i always considered skateboarding a fine art as an artist i see the skateboard as a canvas throughout my life and career my art and skateboarding have always been primary forms of expression i am passionate about being able to cross pollinate the two worlds and aspire for artsprojekt to raise the bar for the quality of skate graphics and initiate a new global standard that empowers artists and brands with a better quality skateboard than ever before
8323138 the skateboarding industry is a large market with incredible potential to expand creative expression on boards
8323139 through our relationship with andy we are able to leverage our proprietary manufacturing systems and online tools to produce skateboards on demand with extraordinary quality
8323140 skateboard graphics were one of the main things that inspired me to become an artist so it goes without saying that i want my art to translate beautifully on skateboards
8323141 in the past printing on a curved board surface had detail limitations or smudging could occur at the bends the artsprojekt boards utilize new digital technology to create perfectly crisp graphics with impeccable detail

8323143 9 and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in jordan
8323144 10 and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him
8323145 22 and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased
8323146 you are my beloved son in whom i am well 11 and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased
8323147 5 and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins
8323148 7 then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me 8 i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my heart
8323149 34 jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work
8323150 7 and preached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
8323151 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
8323152 16 and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord
8323153 25 and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them 26 and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every ones bands were loosed 27 and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled 28 but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here 29 then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas 30 and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved 31 and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house 32 and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house 33 and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway 34 and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house
8323154 5 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him
8323155 19 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
8323156 14 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all amen
8323157 18 for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father
8323158 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
8323159 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
8323160 de meeste mensen hebben geen eenvoudige manier om hun vele bronnen van het web te beheren en taken te vereenvoudigen voor het grootste deel blijven zij wisselen tussen verschillende sites en voeren zij veel voorkomende taken uit waardoor tijd verspild wordt

8323162 selling sick notes is not illegal so a person could type one up and sell it without being prosecuted
8323163 it only becomes illegal when you receive a payment or advantage for instance paid time off work because of its use
8323164 we take fraud against the nhs very seriously and anyone caught using these fraudulent documents will be pursued vigorously
8323165 choose from doctors at medical centres in london manchester birmingham glasgow or any other area
8323166 the deliberate abuse of the sick certification system is to be condemned
8323167 this will also help them take positive action to support employees with genuine long term health problems
8323168 but the key thing is we need to separate out whats helpful and what needs to be looked at and perhaps set aside
8323169 our first priority must be the safety of the public herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8323170 the environment is stimulating and entertaining and theres less fear of falling over
8323171 after a stroke or fall many older people lack motivation and confidence and they dont feel steady on their feet so getting out and about can be an issue and they can find the whole process rather dull
8323172 i can see it working very well on improving strength endurance and stamina
8323173 consistency and practice are key to making progress and this system has huge potential across a wide range of activities which can be tailored to meet individual rehabilitation needs
8323174 the vast majority of stroke survivors cannot use a normal treadmill because they are not in control
8323175 walking is the best possible exercise for their bodies and this system would help enormously
8323176 i was round a friends house smoking a joint when i started hearing something funny
8323177 i started hearing a womans voice cursing and swearing and thought thats not right
8323178 cannabis has absolutely wrecked my life i cant go out drinking or anything like that
8323179 i claim benefits and live on my own its been a long time since i had a girlfriend i manage the best i can
8323180 we do hear stories on a regular basis not only from people that use cannabis but also from concerned family and from concerned friends who can see somebody thats close to them someone they love who is going through a downward spiral
8323181 it can be very very difficult to watch so its not just the possible impact on the individual but also the broader impact as well that it might have on people they are close to
8323182 reclassification from a dealers point of view is just meaningless
8323183 it doesnt matter whether its class b or class c because the sentencing guidelines from the court are still the same
8323184 if you get caught you could get a maximum of 14 years on both so it doesnt really matter for a dealer because its the same penalties either way
8323185 i know that what im doing is illegal but how can something so wrong feel so right
8323186 ive just taken a seed ive put it into some soil added a little bit of water i cut it down i smoke it
8323187 i dont go out on the street i dont offer it to random people but i could have the police coming round here at six oclock in the morning
8323188 im not a criminal im not a bad guy but i face prosecution for growing
8323189 cannabis is a very serious drug its one of the most prevalent drugs particularly amongst young people
8323190 its a very dangerous drug particularly in the skunk form and thats why were taking the action that we are
8323191 if youre getting evidence as we are that the potency of the cannabis has increased and the availability of those stronger strains has increased i think youd be silly not to reflect on that and to change the classification
8323192 another thing were doing with this release is focusing on the product edition that is most often stolen this will reduce the number of customers that will be offered the package this release will be offered to the most pirated edition of windows xp and therefore to users with the highest likelihood of having a non genuine copy those using windows xp pro were also offering it to those using editions based on pro code such as tablet and windows media center but plan to narrow the offering to pro in future releases
8323193 i would love to get revenge for all mexicans whove fought against manny if you ask me that would be my choice because hes considered pound for pound champion of the world and we can meet half ways and make a big fight out of it
8323194 manny holds that mythical title now so all right prove it hes exciting hes strong hes fast i believe the odds came out at two to one so why not
8323195 its a huge opportunity for pacquiao and not only monetarily wise but exposure because the whole world will be watching this fight
8323196 the truth is in the numbers oscar should be getting the lions share the most mannys ever made is four times less than what oscars made in his last five fights average so you really cant compare apples and oranges and manny has to understand that
8323197 freddie roach is already talking that i cant pull the trigger well if this fight happens you watch ill pull the trigger
8323198 it was something that hurt him because he left freddie on good terms after freddie helped him for the fight with mayweather and to be coming from a guy like freddie who he considers a friend it was hurtful
8323199 i can make 147 pounds with no problem i went up six weight classes so its not impossible roy jones went up to heavyweight and he won the title so in the history of boxing its been proven that the smaller guy jumps up three four or five weight classes and can be successful so this wouldnt be the first
8323200 the fact is that in an average fight manny pacquiao makes two and a half three or three and a half million dollars if he goes in against say juan manuel marquez or erik morales maybe he makes four and a half or five million dollars ok so now if he goes and fights oscar hes guaranteed ten million dollars and can potentially make fifteen sixteen or more depending on how the pay per view numbers are under that seventy thirty deal its a little bit difficult to understand why somebody would turn that down
8323201 it certainly isnt because of money because he makes three or four times more so i dont know maybe hes scared fighting oscar there must be a reason why he hasnt said yes
8323202 ogie has been practicing well lately and its paying off im happy for him
8323203 i told the players its payback time its not a secret what they did to us in the first round more than anything else we have to get a win

8323207 i could see that clinton might have endorsed him obama has a lot of attributes he values
8323208 one difference between the two guys is that obama never had an uncle buddy who lived in a trailer

8323218 federal revenues should have been down nearly 20 billion in the first quarter given the measures set out in last falls economic statement
8323219 instead only a 1 1 billion reduction is showing up in the national accounts
8323220 slower economic growth is a negative but right now inflation is above two per cent and were having faster nominal income growth as a consequence and that gets taxed
8323221 over the medium term the conference board expects that the federal government will be able to continue to generate fiscal surpluses
8323222 in turn this will create scope to pay down debt reduce taxes and or introduce targeted increases in spending

8323234 the creature at your feet dismissed as a bug or a weed is a creation in and of itself it has a name a million year history and a place in the world its genome adapts it to a special niche in an ecosystem the ethical value substantiated by close examination of its biology is that the life forms around us are too old too complex and potentially too useful to be carelessly discarded

8323271 god is not a god of confusion but of peace
8323272 to me it is a total hypocrisy on what is deemed to be ball tampering
8323273 1 the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god 2 as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee 3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight 4 john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins 5 and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins 6 and john was clothed with camels hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honey 7 and preached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose 8 i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
8323274 2 as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee 3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
8323275 5 and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins
8323276 2 as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee
8323277 1 behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts
8323278 10 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come 11 and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things 12 but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them 13 then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist
8323279 3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight
8323280 prepare the way of the lord make his paths 3 the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god
8323281 4 john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins
8323282 1 in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea
8323283 6 and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins
8323284 10 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death
8323285 15 and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance
8323286 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
8323287 38 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
8323288 5 and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins
8323289 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord
8323290 7 and preached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose
8323291 8 i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
8323292 4 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me 5 for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence
8323293 1 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place 2 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting 3 and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
8323294 13 for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit
8323295 4 john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins 5 and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins
8323296 18 for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil
8323297 brood of but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come
8323298 42 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here
8323299 7 but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart
8323300 prepare the way of the lord make his paths straight
8323301 15 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
8323302 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned
8323303 but why do you call me lord lord and do not do the things which i say
8323304 46 and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say
8323305 the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god
8323306 36 and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of cyprus 37 having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet
8323307 13 now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to jerusalem
8323308 10 aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you and marcus sisters son to barnabas touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you receive him 11 and jesus which is called justus who are of the circumcision these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god which have been a comfort unto me
8323309 3 for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands oft eat not holding the tradition of the elders 4 and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tables
8323310 17 and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder
8323311 41 and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise
8323312 11 but ye say if a man shall say to his father or mother it is corban that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free
8323313 35 watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning
8323314 13 salute rufus chosen in the lord and his mother and mine
8323315 did not come to be served but to 45 for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many
8323316 1 and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples
8323317 37 and what i say unto you i say unto all watch
8323318 47 and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid
8323319 go into all the world and preach the gospel to 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature
8323320 36 the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all 37 that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judaea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached 38 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him 39 and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree
8323321 25 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them
8323322 13 for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another
8323323 marcus wareing is emerging from ramsays shadow as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in london
8323324 it is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment such as marcus wareing has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity driven empire where the name chef is rarely present
8323325 it is the disappointing standards at ramsays three most recent mass market openings which are most immediately concerning each of them the warrington devonshire house and foxtrot oscar is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the most disappointing meal of the year category these newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that if they were opened by independent operators they would likely be closed within a year
8323326 what he urgently needs to do is to stop chasing media attention across the globe and to start putting some real effort into improving standards at the restaurants in his london heartland
8323327 we are very proud of the huge success of p trus which was opened by grh in march 1999 and as a company we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today
8323328 grh have taken the one and two top spots in the current hardens guide which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guides editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide
8323329 i am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade particularly from such a respected guide as hardens
8323330 it is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as hardens vary in their opinions from food guides such as michelin and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success
8323331 if i never speak to that guy for the rest of my life it wouldnt bother me one bit
8323332 wouldnt give a fuck i admire gordon but would i lose sleep knowing he wouldnt be there no chance when you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained confined and trapped then youve got to change

8323357 our goal is to try to improve the forecast of severe weather as opposed to the daily forecast of weather that might disrupt a softball game but its not really going to tear your house down
8323358 you are watching the hurricane move towards the coast and you think oh its making landfall down by savannah georgia and i live in myrtle beach so im clear and then bam you get hit by a tornado
8323359 they happen a lot and people are caught unaware across the carolinas in 2004 and 2005 alone there were over 130 tornadoes in association with just seven tropical cyclones none of which actually made landfall on the north carolina coast it was just the remnants moving through its a fairly important forecast issue for our area
8323360 the traditional conceptual model is that the individual storms that comprise the hurricane rain bands are ordinary over the ocean and the increase in surface friction over land creates the miniature supercells
8323361 what we have been finding is that you can actually have these miniature supercells form out over the ocean and then produce tornados on or very near the beach
8323362 we are trying to provide proof of concept through high density observations
8323363 ultimately if we can understand what causes the supercell out over the open ocean then we can help forecasters to detect them earlier with radar and give everyone a little more forewarning

8323390 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

8323428 too many americans have taken freedom for granted as a result of the courageous efforts of the principled individuals who peopled this land and formed this nation the average u s citizen enjoys more freedom than any other person in all history
8323429 it is also true we who live in these united states didnt earn our good fortune
8323430 america is dying but she isnt dead her aliments can be cured if her people will recognize and treat them the prescription for national good health is a solid dose of time effort and courage from her sons and daughters
8323431 will we turn over to our sons and daughters the america we inherited the decision is yours
8323432 advocating the overthrow of the government of the united states

8323434 our complacency as a nation is shocking yes almost unbelievable
8323435 we are a prosperous nation our people have high paying jobs our incomes are high our standard of living is at an unprecedented level we do not like to be disturbed as we enjoy our comfortable complacency we live in the soft present and feel the future is secure we do not worry about history we seem oblivious to the causes of the rise and fall of nations we are blind to the hard fact that nations usually sow the seeds of their own destruction while enjoying unprecedented prosperity
8323436 we will not go down to defeat this will be back and we will see it passed
8323437 enough is enough we are free and will remain so we will cleanse ourselves of all those who would destroy our freedoms
8323438 i made a vow around the age of 16 to never be like her
8323439 its interesting the habits i thought id never want i picked up
8323440 its inevitable because our brains were forming when we were around her
8323441 even if a daughter takes after her dad theres still a bit of her mom in her
8323442 if something happens to make me really angry i have to take a deep breath to prevent myself from lashing out which is something she never did
8323443 ive always been uber organized and shes the same way
8323444 lauren was always a perfectionist she used to clean out closets when she had nothing to do
8323445 its really cool to see your children come full circle
8323446 but we share this unique connection an additional special bond between us that is rare
8323447 yes we are open for business today there is no demolition scheduled

8323450 b c transit is seeing a weekly growth in ridership over last year with the saanich peninsula and sidney expansion the commission is continuing to establish the groundwork for a regional transportation network for the future
8323451 today was the 1st day back to classes at duquesne university and all young dems that i talked to were happy about this
8323452 when you put all your eggs in one basket it affects a lot of people in contrast with a small slaughterhouse or butcher shop
8323453 we cant go back to simply feeding ourselves but we can put much more emphasis on local food but when these big outbreaks happen because of public pressure the government ratchets up the safeguards for big industry which puts unbearable cost pressures on the small producers
8323454 we need to work to re localize the food system so were not facing national outbreaks of this scale
8323455 maybe people sleep a little better knowing theyve eaten food thats been grown or raised locally
8323456 but therell be mothers who need to buy meat slices for their childrens lunches out of necessity and convenience
8323457 however our ability to detect these outbreaks is much better than it used to be

8323462 through yoga and lifestyle changes people increase their cd4 count the cells the hiv virus attacks the truth seen for the first time does appear like a miracle
8323463 good exercise it cannot be used to make ridiculous claims about curing hiv or cancer this is false hope for ill people
8323464 the magical remedies act of 1954 was brought in to stop people such as baba ramdev from promoting dangerous ideas about curing cancer and the like
8323465 the political class is running scared of this man and the backlash that such a prosecution might unleash

8323474 a minimalist film but illuminating bittersweet gentle and deeply alive
8323475 the perfect antidote to all those movies where all sorts of stuff blows up
8323476 a beautifully nuanced study in friendship and the irretrievability of the past
8323477 a triumph of modesty and of seriousness that also happens to be one of the finest american films of the year
8323478 it has some pretty scenery but otherwise this was really boring
8323479 lousy lousy lousy story boring redundant and poorly written if there were 20 words of dialog in the entire movie id be surprised
8323480 this is an ode to pretention sic in an hour and a quarter
8323481 will oldham is still hot and i gave it one star because they didnt let the viewer see his junk
8323482 if you enjoy watching other peoples home movies this is the film for you
8323483 there seemed to me a homo erotic message that was a turnoff for us straights and then frustrating because it never seemed to be cleared up
8323484 this may rank as the worst movie we have ever sat through you sic kept watching in the hope that it would improve but it did not
8323485 i could not watch it all because the dialogue and story were too tedious
8323486 a slow paced middle of the road sci fi movie
8323487 one of the most boring and overated movies of all time
8323488 i had to pause it halfway through for a nap
8323489 it is so slow moving and monotonous that it takes a lot of work just to watch
8323490 by my standards a movie must have a plot this didnt
8323491 with the rm193 million gain the net impact if maybank were to lose the deposit will actually be about rm290 million
8323492 this clearly demonstrates the industries commitment towards attaining the strictest standards of sustainability unmatched by any other agricultural crop
8323493 for the initial stage the total oil palm planted area applying for certification covers 160 000ha with production of about one million tonnes of crude palm oil in 2008
8323494 once the certification is completed in stages for these major malaysian companies it is estimated that the rspo certification will cover about 700 000ha with production of 3 0 million tonnes of crude palm oil
8323495 i am glad that when i go to europe in september this year i can tell them that malaysia has kept its promise and that sustainably produced palm oil is available to the european consumers
8323496 we all have one common goal namely to let the world know that certified sustainable palm oil is now available and that this initial certification is the tip of the iceberg and that other companies will soon follow suit
8323497 no other agricultural crop be it coffee cocoa wheat soyabean or rapeseed have so strict guidelines in terms of sustainability
8323498 this is the fourth consecutive quarter of profitability for proton as the company ramps up its strategy to recapture its leading position in the local automotive market
8323499 the right car at the right price and at the right time
8323500 the positive response to saga and persona bodes well for the launch of protons multi purpose vehicle slated for the last quarter of the current financial year
8323501 we will continue with our efforts to minimise costs and improve efficiency in our operations which will also contribute to improvement in our performance in the next quarter
8323502 we are targeting to enhance the contribution from exports as a profit growth engine as we shift from completely built up to completely knocked down operations in our core target markets this will result in increasing cost competitiveness and improved volume
8323503 it is more than the value of goods we are talking about the cost of services in terms of transportation handling and customs clearance services and warehousing
8323504 this would also encourage the setting up of a clearing depot that would create greater employment opportunities within asean
8323505 we hope to start a pilot project for the green lane system in transportation of products across border among singapore malaysia and thailand soon
8323506 at the last asean summit in singapore last year indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono conveyed its interest to participate in the green lane system project and the indonesian trade minister mari pang estu had reiterated this request in todays meeting we will look into this
8323507 for example the now defunct epf withdrawal for pc ownership scheme is a very good effort by the government that should be revisited and revitalised
8323508 this could encourage regular investments in modernisation expansion and diversification activities particularly in the broadband space
8323509 that fourth defensive tackle is a guy by the name of klecko
8323510 he just knows how to work the edges in order to be a great pass rusher you have to know how to work the edges hes a specialist at that
8323511 it is important to chris well have to see day by day i dont know how hard he can go but he needs to get out there and he needs to practice
8323512 last year was a bumper year in terms of loan disbursements because of the salary increment for civil servants we will see a growth this year but perhaps not as good
8323513 we are in a more competitive environment now because there are more players
8323514 the significant improvement in our loan financing business was due to demand growth in the personal loan financing products
8323515 we dont discount that we will probably go back to vietnam and look for opportunities there we are also keen on other regional markets
8323516 the vietnam venture was originally seen as a good deal because we were going in at par if we enter any other market at that time we would have had to pay a premium on the joint venture
8323517 there are some high paying countries which offer tax free wages to white collar workers these are some of the challenges faced by local construction companies who want to go global
8323518 what we can do in the short term is reward them or create a minimum pay scale and in the long term the sector should plan on improving training and education
8323519 despite the current market scenario we were able to register stronger growth than the last quarter
8323520 we are optimistic that we will be able to sustain or even improve our performance for the rest of the year especially with the good response we have been receiving from our flagship projects cahaya alam and the strand damansara
8323521 we are now looking at various options on how to satisfy the requirement by the authorities
8323522 we hope to be able to complete the exercise within the prescribed time
8323523 talks are still in early stages we dont know when it will be concluded

8323526 non avrei mai pensato che dopo julio baptista la roma potesse mettere a segno un colpo importante come quello di menez
8323527 furthermore our main supplier of corn india has banned the export of its corn since july as a result we had to turn to the us where corn prices are 40 per cent higher
8323528 we will continue to place emphasis on cost management and efficiency and we hope to be able to maintain our profit level this year
8323529 i know weve always been just friends and all but since i did meet you on eharmony i thought i should tell you i met this amazing guy named cj
8323530 the chinese tourism industry provides huge potential for korea and since malaysia has a very advanced tourism industry it holds a promising area for both countries to do more in the future
8323531 the korea asean free trade agreement signed last year will be a catalyst to strengthen our partnership to greater heights
8323532 joint ventures and strategic alliances between both are countries have been expanding and diversifying from manufacturing to more value added and technologically advanced sectors such as information and communication technology oil and gas finance property development tourism and education
8323533 going forward the continuing high level of oil prices increases in raw material costs particularly newsprint and the trickle down effect of the us economic slowdown will have an impact on the groups results
8323534 therefore barring unforeseen circumstances the board of directors is optimistic of better operational performance for the current financial year
8323535 at present the us market represents 85 to 90 per cent of our export market but we expect to see the european market grow faster thus equalising contributions at a 50 50 ratio
8323536 in 2007 we paid a total of rm351 02 million and declared a dividend of eight sen which included a one sen special bonus in conjunction with malaysias 50th merdeka celebrations
8323537 calculation of income distribution this year will be based on lowest average monthly balance for the period of investment from september 1 last year until august 31 this year
8323538 the undisputed leader in malaysia across all high margin and profitable products and segments
8323539 the initiatives will be rolled out rapidly with results consistently tracked and measured to ensure continuous innovation and change in the current practices
8323540 the automotive industry has requested for a 50 per cent rebate on import duty excise duty and exemption of road tax on hybrid vehicles
8323541 we are already off the blocks although late in the game protons british outfit lotus has developed and showcased its own hybrid car last year which got rave reviews
8323542 hybrid vehicles are the future of the automotive industry thus we are hopeful that the government will provide industry players incentives to develop the sector here
8323543 if you ask me if i am in the business of selling hybrid cars just because of the rising cost of fuel the answer is a big no
8323544 higher fuel price is an issue but other drivers such as carbon emission and its effects on the wider economy and food shortages also have profound long term effects that helps shape the technology of today for tomorrow
8323545 at that point battery technology will be ubiquitous and vehicles will communicate with one another and the road to make driving safer and easier
8323546 the green revolution is at the gates the onus is on us to adopt
8323547 due to their multi tasking and multi roles women tend to be more vulnerable to risks so we come out with a comprehensive protection plan for them
8323548 we hope this product will carry the biggest premium among our personal accident products
8323549 how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time

8323551 you are the christ the son of the living god
8323552 blessed are you simon bar jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven 18 and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it 19 i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
8323553 i am the lord i have called you in righteousness i will take you by the hand and keep you i will give you as a covenant for the people a light for the nations
8323554 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty those who are oppressed 19 to proclaim the year of the lords favor

8323560 overgrown military establishments are under any form of government inauspicious to liberty
8323561 any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment
8323562 the fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him
8323563 when everything becomes clear when every action constitutes a commitment when every choice has a price
8323564 the american soldier is different from all other soldiers of all other countries since the world began he is the advance guard of liberty and justice of law and order and of peace and happiness

8323568 fewer than half routinely recommend them and one in six never recommend them
8323569 because of this a few cases of rickets caused by vitamin d deficiency are being noted probably more cases will be seen if this trend is not reversed
8323570 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8323571 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley lined them up and shot them
8323572 we then pushed the bodies into the canal and left
8323573 fixing our eyes on jesus the author and finisher of our faith
8323574 it is always the holy spirits work to turn our eyes away from self to jesus but satans work is just the opposite of this for he is constantly trying to make us pay attention to ourselves instead of to christ
8323575 your sins are too great for pardon you have no faith you do not repent enough you will never be able to continue to the end you do not have the joy of his children you have such a weak hold of jesus

8323589 the person who was supposed to give her a ride fell through
8323590 shitty i called her and was cussing her out so loud that staff shut the phone off on me
8323591 should we eat it anyway since its going to get dried out
8323592 if i tell you something do you promise you wont tell anyone else
8323593 will you tell me if you get really worried about her if shes not okay
8323594 sure can you do something for me first though have you done any journaling about this

8323599 if we were put into individual capsules with our art materials and fired out into different parts of outer space we would still have everything we loved about painting which was the opportunity to lay on paint
8323600 there are reasons why we havent included a keyboard controller
8323601 not all of our songs have keyboard parts so we didnt want someone to come into a game pick up the keyboard controller and then have nothing to do in any of the songs that are selected we wanted a big mix of music in world tour and adding a keyboard controller would either have limited our choices or the players
8323602 a keyboard controller deserves to be introduced with its own game this is something were thinking about
8323603 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8323604 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8323605 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8323606 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8323607 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8323608 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8323609 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful
8323610 but they are not effective against global warming and in order to ensure the long term survival of this rich marine community that is what we need to address
8323611 this is the guy to have do your templates hes professional quick and creative he worked with me until the template looked exactly how i wanted to look bottom line is he does great work i will be using him in the future
8323612 lorem ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry lorem ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s
8323613 i think its the most ridiculous idea ever conceived it would say you got the card they got the clean i can be unprotected no big deal
8323614 the classic view which we are not disputing is that there are diminishing marginal returns to economic development
8323615 so for initial levels of economic development people are escaping subsistence poverty and peoples subjective levels of happiness will increase
8323616 happiness is the gap between what you have and what you expect to have in life if that gap is very small then you are happy and if it is quite wide then naturally you are quite unhappy
8323617 in more affluent societies people give higher priority to free choice and self expression which accordingly play an increasingly important role in shaping their wellbeing
8323618 people living in more tolerant societies tend to be happier regardless of their own beliefs
8323619 there will be no insertion of campaign objects enemies or friendlies via the forge as folks have speculated

8323634 my father had really changed and said he didnt want to know me anymore
8323635 everything was so alien i met many relatives but i had no memory of them
8323636 there are economical and political walls but there are emotional and psychological ones too
8323637 it is a mindset of not trusting people of closing yourself in and not believing anything
8323638 the love of beauty is so ingrained in the people here
8323639 everybody keeps saying my art is a gentle stroke on the heart that gives them hope hope truth light and what people have lost here

8323644 the boy oageng mogale was in his home yard when the tiger pounced on him his father rushed to assist him but the animal attacked him too
8323645 while busy searching the tiger emerged from the trees and pounced on the police officers
8323646 one of the cops fired shots from his rifle and the tiger diverted its attention to a police reservist who also fired a shot from his gun
8323647 a reservist was shot twice in the leg by diverted ammunition
8323648 i couldnt say because if someone has promised me to cheslea owner roman abramovich it wasnt me
8323649 im kidding of course ive always said that im happy at milan and as long as i have the same objectives as milan ill stay here
8323650 thats the way its always been my aim is to win and thats the same with milan as you can see by the effort theyve made in that direction strengthening the squad in such a way that this will always be a team of winners
8323651 people say were not interested in winning the uefa cup this group has won everything we could possibly win
8323652 our main aim is to win the scudetto i think inter milan will be the team to beat given what theyve done these last few years
8323653 then of course juve whove bought well this year theyll also be playing in the champions league and could have a great season
8323654 and then theres always as roma who are a team that play great football these will be our rivals throughout the season but there are always surprises
8323655 fiorentina are a team that have been playing together for some time now and last season they had a great year and they could repeat that
8323656 and then well see if there are any other surprise packages
8323657 i like him ive met him a few times we spoke a little and everyone thats worked with him says hes a great coach

8323659 one of the things that you see is she has very limited hand gestures and we look for hand gestures to tell us whats important so when we see them out when we see them up this is significant and we saw them just a few times last night but not enough this was not an impassioned speech
8323660 it was the same way with ronald reagan in the last few years he was president
8323661 those are the reasons i ran for president those are the reasons i support barack obama and those are the reasons you should too
8323662 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible

8323668 he was like a prince in milan and at chelsea our philosophy was different we had no princes
8323669 everybody needs to work like everybody else and prove he deserves to play
8323670 i think maybe he lost some self confidence step by step a player goes in the wrong direction
8323671 he was not my first option but the club gave him to me as a second option
8323672 i believe in the future he will again be a player of high quality the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future
8323673 the truth is i never had a single personal problem with him and i wish him well for the future

8323695 this girl had left schools because of the bullying had been counselled for it and at the end of the day came along to me to see whether surgery would improve the appearance of her nose it has had an amazingly positive result for her
8323696 this is an example of a child where an aesthetic procedure has had a benefit but it is not something that is offered as a first line treatment it is almost a procedure of last resort on a youngster but it can have a positive benefit for them
8323697 you think about children whose ears stick out its the same thing children are very cruel and theres a lot of stigma attached to appearance
8323698 it is giving in to bullies if you have to change something about yourself because people are making remarks about you you are giving in to their views
8323699 i think it is very hard for parents and children to say to themselves that there are perhaps better ways of dealing with this and one of those is to force the school to take action against the bullies
8323700 our ultimate goal is that in the event of a real emergency all text messages will be received within 10 minutes
8323701 we need to know if you do not get the message or fail to receive it in a timely manner

8323713 when we have an environment like this people tend to pull inward a little bit

8323728 vendors who do business which involves the expenditure of public funds must understand that strict compliance with the law is mandatory
8323729 was unaware of any potential concerns created by such engagements
8323730 the classic view which we are not disputing is that there are diminishing marginal returns to economic development
8323731 so for initial levels of economic development people are escaping subsistence poverty and peoples subjective levels of happiness will increase
8323732 happiness is the gap between what you have and what you expect to have in life if that gap is very small then you are happy and if it is quite wide then naturally you are quite unhappy
8323733 in more affluent societies people give higher priority to free choice and self expression which accordingly play an increasingly important role in shaping their wellbeing
8323734 people living in more tolerant societies tend to be happier regardless of their own beliefs

8323750 it seems like there is an insatiable demand for mobile videos in india
8323751 with the first mobile operators in india starting to offer mobile videos now these services are being priced and limited in choice as the operators define and provide the content viewable for their customers our multitude of clips as well as our support of media players like the ipod and the iphone makes our service unique and overwhelming when compared to what is available from operators
8323752 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
8323753 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery

8323763 in todays media environment it is vital that businesses communicate online and companies that choose to ignore this are running a major risk traditional pr tactics are not going to go away anytime soon but it is essential for companies to integrate online pr and social media into their existing offline communications strategies
8323764 despite finding that an increasing number of uk pr professionals are on the ball when it comes to online pr this survey confirms our experience that a high proportion are still more focused on traditional media however given that this is most probably a reflection of client budget and resource allocations perhaps what we should be asking ourselves is what this says about uk business attitude towards online communications

8323777 for far too long servers have been sold by expensive local firms as small businesses have been too intimidated to buy servers online even though the potential savings are huge

8323779 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
8323780 despite the predicted downturn we are still suffering a skills crisis so it is essential that we dont disillusion our skilled workers at a time when we need them most

8323787 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
8323788 weve been trying to tell the world about this for months if you go back and look at the archives youll see plenty of calls from the georgian government saying theyre really worried even some russian commentators agree that this is exactly what happened dont forget they sent in a lot of irregulars chechens cossacks ossetians ingush basically thugs not normal chechens or ingush thugs thugs out for a holiday many western camera crews were robbed at gunpoint ten meters from russian tanks while russian commanders just stood there smoking their cigarettes while the irregulars that happened to a turkish tv crew theyre lucky to still be alive some of the georgians were picked up by the irregulars if they happened to be female they got raped if they happened to be male they got shot immediately sometimes tortured injured people we have in hospitals who managed to get out have had arms chopped off eyes gouged out and their tongues ripped out

8323827 ohchr calls on the indian authorities and in particular security forces to respect the right to freedom of assembly and expression and comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
8323828 the use of force should be proportionate to the threat posed and firearms must only be used in dispersing a violent assembly to protect individuals against an imminent threat of death or serious injury

8323830 some weekends i feel like we have a dominant car and other weekends i feel like were a fifth place car or even a 10th place car
8323831 with the strong team we have we seem to be able to rally back and get finishes out of it so i still think that we are maybe behind
8323832 in different weeks the 88 car earnhardt has been the car the 24 gordon was the car early we were and its just tough to really say where were at
8323833 its been tough for him and its been a huge huge challenge for him
8323834 but more importantly the go to moves that weve always had with the old car do not work with the cot and to kind of retrain chads brain and look at things in a different way that is the hardest part for him
8323835 the latest greatest moves and the stuff we thought was going to work based on the old car and we were not even in the same race
8323836 we were out there in a seven cylinder class it seemed like that has been the hardest part to find out where to work and thats what weve done all season long
8323837 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past doesnt work with this new car
8323838 we are trying to find the right direction in the right areas to turn him loose and let him work
8323839 its a lot of small areas and we are now i feel getting the rhythm of this car and understanding what to work on
8323840 as the chase gets closer everybody that has a shot at this thing is going to find ways to motivate themselves and areas they can potentially play mind games in or be out on the track and try to intimidate someone
8323841 i feel like we are one of the guys to be considered a favorite in the championship and look forward to getting started

8323878 hoy hemos venido al cne a consignar una denuncia por la negligencia del cne en la publicaci n oportuna de las normas de publicidad y propaganda para los pr ximos comicios electorales
8323879 seg n el propio cronograma del cne estas normas debieron ser aprobadas el 28 de mayo y hecho p blicas el 29 de julio y a estas fechas todav a esas normas no se han publicado
8323880 creemos que la ausencia de normas permiten que se produzcan estos desmanes con bienes p blicos y sobre todo hace c mplice al cne
8323881 hemos visto adem s con estupor que la propia presidenta del cne tibisay lucena diga que las normas no est n listas todav a que van a estar listas la pr xima semana y de alguna manera no nos creamos demasiadas expectativas porque esas normas van a ser las mismas que han sido publicadas en eventos anteriores
8323882 esto nos parece una falta de responsabilidad una falta de respeto verdaderamente algo que da pena en vista del salario que tienen estos funcionarios y que en esta fecha den este tipo de repuestas

8323904 at a time when police are feeling isolated from the communities they are recruited from and live in this ideologically driven denial of democratic rights enjoyed by every other new zealander including public servants just aggravates that feeling of isolation
8323905 the policing bill went through more than two years of community consultation and development and the government policy after that process was that police should be able to serve on councils
8323906 now it has decided at the 11th hour with no consultation to reverse that policy and undermine the rights of every new zealand police officer
8323907 any substantive reason whatsoever for the about face other than a desire to satisfy new zealand first
8323908 i think the public will look at the reality and make up its own mind there were many submissions about this issue including from the legislation advisory committee criminologists and law faculty staff and the government took notice of them
8323909 the submissions generally supported clarity on the issue of whether police should be able to stand for local authorities that make laws that subsequently need to be enforced
8323910 it is a different matter with community boards which act in a purely advisory way and which are quite suitable bodies for police employees to play an active part in
8323911 quite frankly i am very disappointed greg oconnor and the association have used that sort of language the reality is that new zealand police have never had a better period than they have had under this government
8323912 police believed until the very last minute that labour opposed nz firsts bid to deny them the right to serve on councils but that was before they snuck their u turn clause into the policing bill
8323913 labour and nz first have just denied police officers an everyday democratic right enjoyed by every other person in this country

8323927 the board is working towards a substantial release of value to shareholders in 2010 which will coincide with gpgs 20th anniversary and my own retirement as chairman of the company
8323928 if one had said at the outset it would go on for 20 years that would have seemed unlikely at the time
8323929 a pretty reasonable cycle for any company particularly one like gpg with such a small team at the top
8323930 i reckon over the next two years we can enhance the present value quite considerably and thats what well be trying to do it just seems a natural period of time and sensible to indicate where we are going and i think thats something shareholders have been looking for as well
8323931 thats up to my colleagues i assume they will want to carry on in some form whether they want to do so in the traditional gpg way or in new entities or whatever i just dont know i dont think they do either
8323932 because its still quite a way off and probably includes a period of some uncertainty around some of its other investments it may take some time but it helps give people a time frame over which they can invest in gpg and expect a return
8323933 purely ifrs nonsense and can be safely disregarded as a legitimate inclusion in any proper analysis of the result
8323934 in the hope expectation that the inevitable changes in the companys trading environment are looming ever closer and our faith will be finally rewarded

8323961 they asked her to stay because of the current political uncertainty
8323962 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8323963 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty and if its not this government or not this parliament the public will have an opportunity to decide whom
8323964 well have to judge whether its appropriate to ask people to vote twice in the space of a few weeks
8323965 i think the fact that it seems to be taking several weeks just to have a phone call with opposition leaders i think indicates frankly a much deeper issue and that is that this parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
8323966 today is an additional episode of a continuing saga of a fabricated emergency by the prime minister
8323967 he wants to meet me and to pretend that the meeting went so badly that he needs to call an election thats what its all about

8324036 pictures of ronald reagan you can debate whether ronald reagan was good or bad but the point is everything he said he stood for is being put to the sword by george bush but i wont even have that debate with you george bush is a puppet i refuse to live in this false reality with you the country is dying weve been de industrialized weve been strip mined politically economically and spiritually

8324042 i will not go away i will not turn off the camera we are in public are you worried perhaps about the criminal liability of being a partner to mass murder after the fact you know that is a real concern because the truth is coming out
8324043 they will see every piece of evidence that goes to the finder of fact whether classified or not i want to make that very clear
8324044 the charges allege that khalid sheikh mohammed was the mastermind of the 9 11 attacks by proposing the operational concept to osama bin laden as early as 1996 obtaining approval and funding from osama bin laden for the attacks
8324045 taliban fighters are guilty of nothing but standing in defense of the innocent victims of 911

8324047 as nazi tanks crossed into poland in 1939 an american senator declared lord if only i could have talked to hitler all of this might have been avoided we have an obligation to call this what it is the false comfort of appeasement which has been repeatedly discredited by history

8324057 this barbarous act has no place among civilized peoples and shocks the conscience of all peace loving nations there is no cause that could ever justify this action
8324058 the politicians that we vote for wont stay and fight and they wont count the votes
8324059 we look like dying idiots folks denying that the people who murdered our fellow citizens general ahmad and co
8324060 the world should respect any action taken by ungodly zionist evil israel in order to defend its citizens

8324071 he claims to be a follower of the torah of moses but as far as i know the torah prohibits oppression and prohibits injustice and prohibits stealing peoples land and property
8324072 the attack will be spectacular and designed to inflict mass casualties against u s facilities or interests attack preparations have been made attack will occur with little or no warning

8324078 these are the people who have overthrown elected governments all over the world and he richard perle comes on your program to prattle about democracy
8324079 i just want to point out that were going to encourage the people to look at the evidence for themselves
8324080 ii to have materially assisted sponsored or provided financial material logistical or technical support
8324081 those who negotiate in the name of the taliban will be killed

8324084 this document does not purport to provide a prosecutable case against usama bin laden in a court of law
8324085 and at this juncture we are able to perform professional no notice inspections all over iraq and to increase aerial surveillance
8324086 right now my plan is to actually start trent so that he can get prepared for a game as if he were the starter which obviously means not planning on playing marc bulger
8324087 marc has a lot of snaps in preseason trent has really had limited work and i think could use some time out there on the field
8324088 this gives him a chance in a game to go out and find his rhythm
8324089 so hes not going in the season cold without reps if we ever called upon him
8324090 you cant assume that just because hes a vet that knows the system that he can just go out there and turn it on although i would bet on him more than a lot of guys
8324091 right now my plan is to actually start trent so that he can get prepared for a game as if he were the starter which obviously means not planning on playing marc bulger

8324097 we will be back with the family in four years before the parole board to ensure that morales remains in prison where he will be unable to hurt another innocent person in our society
8324098 there is no better story to tell than that of a homegrown hoosier company that continues to grow and create new jobs
8324099 were committed to creating the best business environment we can so these 50 companies to watch and all the businesses across our state continue to succeed in todays global economy
8324100 should relieve much of the near term concerns regarding its balance sheet
8324101 the fact that it wasnt a billion or billion half writedown was quite encouraging
8324102 the bulk of the miss on our numbers stems from higher than anticipated provisions for credit losses related to higher losses in the banks credit card portfolio
8324103 this is troubling and could indicate additional pressure in future quarters
8324104 revenues in retail banking were actually down for the quarter which i was disappointed in because we saw fairly positive results out of bank of montreal yesterday and pretty healthy results out of bank of nova scotia
8324105 they basically spend a lot of their time putting out these fires in the capital markets business and its really distracting from their ability to establish and foster a long term growth engine
8324106 oil markets are keeping a nervous eye on gustav with forecasts showing it may move into the gulf of mexico
8324107 an israeli national was abducted in the city yesterday tuesday we are still checking the details of the incident
8324108 the cyclical upswing in commodity prices from the low in october 2001 at 226 8 per cent is now virtually on par with the huge 235 1 per cent advance in the 1970s in the aftermath of the arab oil embargo
8324109 the strength of this upswing is a testimony to the remarkable growth of emerging market demand this decade in the face of significant supply constraints in many resource sectors
8324110 buoyed by very low visible exchange stocks and supply disruptions likely totalling about 750 000 tonnes in 2008
8324111 recent developments in chinas electricity market point to strength in international steam and coking coal prices in the second half of 2008
8324112 we feel that it is a wake up call to companies that have websites that are selling goods and services
8324113 they need to pay attention to accessibility it is the right thing to do
8324114 as the companys online business has evolved we have made significant enhancements in order to provide an accessible shopping experience
8324115 this is an excellent start to the year for the nhs
8324116 a strong financial position backed by good progress on delivery will continue to ensure high quality services for patients
8324117 this forecast surplus begs the question whether taxpayers money is being used effectively
8324118 what evidence is there that trusts are using their surpluses to prepare for fluctuations in demand and investment in new services is this the nhs preparing for a period of slower growth in funding or is this individual trusts building up a surplus so that they can survive in a more competitive environment
8324119 several reports have shown that the current funding system risks damaging quality in the nhs but has done nothing to improve efficiency
8324120 ministers should focus on sorting this out rather than patting themselves on the back for allowing the nhs to bank more and more cash
8324121 there continue to be hospitals whose finances are far from stable as we can see from the number of primary care trusts who are rationing access to medicines
8324122 casi un 85 de la informaci n accesible en internet no es indizada por nuestro buscador
8324123 everything has become more expensive now including pizza for people who need to watch what they spend
8324124 in naples and elsewhere in italy that should be enough to cover costs and give a profit margin without damaging quality
8324125 when they put the crown on my head i felt an adrenalin rush that i have never felt before in my life
8324126 with the exception of the nightly newshour it has become a generalized entertainment format to have showgirls to seduce the audience
8324127 the veline model would not be a problem if it was one of many models offered on television but we dont have television that seems to be capable of other options
8324128 at times there are terrible programs in say britain or spain but at least viewers have a richer variety of shows to choose from
8324129 for men its a bit of a trap and for women they represent a model of success and fashion
8324130 television is a mirror of society and italian society tells women that you have to look sexy and young all the time
8324131 we cant get out of the stereotype of the superbabe or the foxy mama
8324132 it privileges easy success through shortcuts and without daily effort
8324133 whoever wants to become a television journalist is subjected to far worse humiliation than the girls competing to become veline
8324134 just like christopher columbus who didnt invent america but discovered it all ive done is make veline visible theyve always existed
8324135 italians dont think theres anything wrong with having a good looking half naked woman next to a male presenter giving the news
8324136 italians dont like guns and blood and they prefer their women less guns and blood more half naked women thats our bread and butter
8324137 the six point ceasefire agreement of august 12 which bears the signatures of russian president dmitry medvedev and georgian president mikheil saakashvili and mine must be applied in full
8324138 the military forces which have not yet withdrawn to the lines preceding the launch of hostilities must move without delay
8324139 this decision which aims to change georgias borders unilaterally is simply unacceptable
8324140 with irish prime minister brian cowen we will identify the guarantees that can enable europe to pass this new stage in its construction
8324141 i tell our irish friends that we need them that europe needs them that we respect them but that they must also hear the call of all other europeans who want institutions for europe
8324142 these new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurements because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries
8324143 the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
8324144 are pretty convincing that were going to see increases in poverty as a result of food and fuel prices
8324145 down the road we will be looking at what may be required to rebuild the georgian military
8324146 right now the mission of the united states military is to provide humanitarian assistance
8324147 the danger is letting the russians think they can get away with this and do it again in ukraine or someplace else they have to realize that theyre not going to get a free ride
8324148 its physically impossible for us to do enough to deter the russians from further incursions so its not clear to me that military aid would be appreciably more than symbolic
8324149 its hard to imagine that the united states would embark on the process of rearming georgia until the conflict has reached a stable equilibrium that at least has the possibility of triggering some kind of military confrontation between the u s and russia
8324150 im looking for the track so i can get a seat because i like to sit on the outside
8324151 when i travel with my wife its really a pain getting two seats together
8324152 the ticket counter said it was going to be 20 minutes late
8324153 in europe you can hop the train so much easier and its cheaper i dont know why we cant do that here if they had more trains maybe i would ride more
8324154 when i was in europe i took the train a lot
8324155 they have a fair number of passenger cars that are out of service that could be put back into service with modest amounts of expenditure but their budget doesnt permit that
8324156 for me it costs the same to fly to drive or to take the train so you just have to pick your poison
8324157 i want to stay out of the airports so its easier to do this
8324158 thousands of police will be deployed to move the protesters out of the government house
8324159 more people will join us tomorrow dont leave or we will lose if we hold on we will win in the next three to four days
8324160 the pads last whistle blow is unjustified unnecessary provocative and illegal
8324161 if the pad really wants to bring down the government it should do so through the parliament that is the proper democratic place to do it
8324162 i know he gave up the vice captaincy a little while ago because there were a few issues there and there probably still are a few issues
8324163 but if its as a stand in and an emergency i dont think he will say no to helping the team out
8324164 i said to the guys in the changing room after the game that not all is lost
8324165 we have been 2 0 down before and came back to win that series in pakistan somehow we have got to try to do it again
8324166 it seems a long way away to win three games in a row but england have won two in a row and its only one more game than that
8324167 theres no reason why we cant change momentum its going to take a massive effort from the senior players but its an opportunity for us to stand up and be counted
8324168 we have talked about trying to forget what happened at trent bridge but you cant
8324169 one or two of the senior guys are really going to have to respond now if we are going to have any chance at all in the series
8324170 its not as if we were not there it was different from the first game when all the batsmen got in and then gave it away and got out at bad times
8324171 but that is the way we decided to go with selection we are playing wicket taking bowlers
8324172 we were criticised in the past for not having wicket takers so we have gone with this kind of selection
8324173 so it is about knuckling down and one of the top four has to bat through and get a hundred every time
8324174 we dont want to pack the team with nine batsmen and send the message to the top order that there are other people that can do the job
8324175 we have got to put the responsibility on the top six batsmen that is why they are in the side
8324176 i have to say that now i have another passion and thats coaching because i had a couple of series with the pakistan team with bob woolmer
8324177 that was a very good experience and now i have the chance to share my cricket experience i have learned over the years
8324178 i can pass that on to other players especially youngsters anywhere i can get a position i will be happy to give my services to anybody
8324179 especially here at sussex as sussex is my home so if they want my services im here for them
8324180 it was time i had two injuries this season and i thought from a medical point of view i couldnt deliver my best
8324181 i have always played at my best all me life i didnt want to play when i was not able to give my best
8324182 i spoke to my wife and as the pain was there i decided to say goodbye to this part of my life
8324183 i try to give every enjoyment i can to the people at sussex
8324184 i always hoped to make people happy here at sussex ive had a great relationship with all the people at sussex
8324185 i dont want to be remembered as a cricketer i want to be remembered as a person
8324186 some weekends i feel like we have a dominant car and other weekends i feel like were a fifth place car or even a 10th place car
8324187 with the strong team we have we seem to be able to rally back and get finishes out of it so i still think that we are maybe behind
8324188 in different weeks the 88 car earnhardt has been the car the 24 gordon was the car early we were and its just tough to really say where were at
8324189 its been tough for him and its been a huge huge challenge for him
8324190 but more importantly the go to moves that weve always had with the old car do not work with the cot and to kind of retrain chads brain and look at things in a different way that is the hardest part for him
8324191 the latest greatest moves and the stuff we thought was going to work based on the old car and we were not even in the same race
8324192 we were out there in a seven cylinder class it seemed like that has been the hardest part to find out where to work and thats what weve done all season long
8324193 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past doesnt work with this new car
8324194 we are trying to find the right direction in the right areas to turn him loose and let him work
8324195 its a lot of small areas and we are now i feel getting the rhythm of this car and understanding what to work on
8324196 as the chase gets closer everybody that has a shot at this thing is going to find ways to motivate themselves and areas they can potentially play mind games in or be out on the track and try to intimidate someone
8324197 i feel like we are one of the guys to be considered a favorite in the championship and look forward to getting started
8324198 track and field is my job this is what i do i work
8324199 right now im just trying to get my blood pumping pretty much ive been doing a little bit of training
8324200 i know the celebrations will wait until i get home so im not worried
8324201 i am just trying to come here and let the fans enjoy my performance because they come here to see a performance
8324202 he hasnt really had time to get rest and training
8324203 but he is still pretty much in good shape and he will put on a good show on friday
8324204 i cant do it on my own personally but the other guys definitely are stepping up i think track and field is getting better
8324205 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8324206 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event
8324207 i havent set any goals for the rest of the season
8324208 just try to get through the season injury free and go home and enjoy myself
8324209 oh and little redz took a spill on her bike on the roof on the monkey bars on her own two stupid feet really banged herself up
8324210 if you try to pull my leg why ill pinch you
8324211 of course i can see you the blood ruby wears off after a while have you been there all along
8324212 i had to work quite hard in finding a very particular way for that snitch to be caught because i knew i was going to do that later initially as my british editor can confirm i had hedwig catch that snitch she wanted that changed and i thought oh god back to the drawing board actually thats what sealed hedwigs fate because the plan was for hedwig to open the snitch because she touched it first but by making it harry then it was time to kill her earlier i think she was going to die anyway eventually

8324261 we are trying to get individuals to become more aware of their health
8324262 yes it is a good idea to encourage employees to improve their health get in shape be fit
8324263 however being overweight even obese is not necessarily linked to ones diet
8324264 this is a situation where the carrot is better than the stick
8324265 assessing a cash penalty for lack of improvement can work but there may not be full buy in of the concept
8324266 many people who are of average weight are afflicted with the kind of medical issues typically associated with obesity
8324267 if the concern is about poor health why not focus on health issues instead of weight
8324268 with health care costs continuing to spiral it was just a matter of time before employers took out the hammer to achieve savings
8324269 this page would rather see incentives that reward healthy behaviors
8324270 there is no denying that when alabama has a population that ranks only second to mississippi in obesity exceptional measures are necessary

8324277 some towns continue to block megastores because they object to their economic impact on local merchants and the traffic congestion they can create but thousands of other towns across the usa that welcomed them face a growing challenge what to do with the cavernous spaces left behind by retailers such as home depot wal mart and kmart when they downsize or expand elsewhere

8324283 education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught
8324284 most people are other people their thoughts are someone elses opinions their lives a mimicry their passions a quotations
8324285 nothing is either good or bad but thinking makes it so
8324286 few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment most people are even incapable of forming such opinions

8324310 we are very proud of winning the competition it is seldom that one gets the opportunity to create such an exciting and prestigious project as an opera
8324311 we at arkitema have worked for a long time in the icelandic market with this competition in our practice our presence there will be strengthened even more furthermore it is a cultural project which has a great sense of meaning not only for the opera but for the towns residents and provides reykjavik with a new shining landmark
8324312 when i came to the school ten years ago cricket was dead here
8324313 there was no equipment no teams but the kids were screaming out for cricket now weve beaten plenty of public schools and grammar schools and our exam results are among the best in the area
8324314 we actually find that the top kids in the school are often the ones whove been involved in the cricket
8324315 being involved with cricket helps them find discipline in themselves gives them a good attitude the teams get very close knit theyre like families i like to get the older kids mentoring the young ones which helps develop them as people as well as players
8324316 wed go to public schools that had dozens of outdoor nets and pitches when we were still practising on mats in the gym and playing all our games away because we didnt have our own pitch
8324317 there were no clubs in the area for them to join theyd just give up and hang around the streets there was no natural progression all our hard work was going nowhere
8324318 the field was pretty much derelict it was overgrown there was no maintenance thered be drug addicts hanging around it was pretty much a no go area early on we had trouble with vandalism but weve started working with those kids getting them to help us making them see that its their club we set up five a sides for them get them to come up and run barbecues
8324319 the pavilion will have a classroom in it and well have an eco station outside for local schools plus an outdoor play area and an outdoor resistance gym
8324320 we want the club to continue being at the heart of the community its not a private club since weve had cricket coaching up there every night the park has become a big community centre anyway with people coming up to play football or just watch the cricket its a real family atmosphere
8324321 the exceptional design and location of the 40 40 club will enable our guests to access a very special race and sports book and restaurant environment in the palazzo
8324322 by adding a complete gaming component to an already distinctive 24 000 square foot space we will be able to create a very unique environment for our guests
8324323 we are pleased by the pending merger of campofrio and groupe smithfield the merger clearly creates a european packaged meats powerhouse with the number one share in many major markets
8324324 this merger also monetizes our investment in the groupe smithfield joint venture into a 37 percent share in a publicly traded company with 3 billion in sales
8324325 given the overall adverse environment of the industry i am pleased with the results for the current quarter
8324326 our fresh pork operations and our packaged meats business performed well in the face of sharply rising input costs we are continuing to focus closely on our cost structure and improving plant operating efficiencies also our new management structure is in place and moving forward nicely
8324327 we continue to be challenged by high input costs across all the businesses certainly a portion of this increase is the result of the current ethanol policy in place
8324328 the current government mandate puts the company in a position of having to compete with foreign oil for feed for our livestock this mandate has resulted in more than 30 percent of the corn crop being diverted from animal feed to ethanol production resulting in a sharp run up in corn prices tied to world oil markets this is a dynamic this industry has never faced we believe this policy is flawed and needs to be revised if food cost inflation is to be brought under control

8324391 we obviously come off on the circuit as a top band were on the radio weve had videos on mtv theres a chick in the band were all young it can be very gimmicky but i think when people decide to take a closer look i think were a little more than the red hair the age the radio play i like to believe theres something more there

8324394 what motivates me is seeing people in the crowd and wondering what theyre going home to and what theyre dealing with and knowing that for the time being were their escape
8324395 i think its definitely getting close to time for a break
8324396 not a break from music but a break from touring
8324397 were in a good place as young individuals we have a lot of opportunity because this business is the best place to just do anything

8324410 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8324411 imagine that every time a client asked about a possible design change you had an answer ready showing exactly what that change would cost a siteops scor report lets you do exactly that
8324412 siteops routinely saves hundreds of thousands of dollars on grading and other site development costs scor reports put that cost savings information directly in front of decision makers at the time when they can use it most
8324413 our clients tell us that in a tight market this tool gives them the competitive edge in winning new business
8324414 these three new programs are for customers who are feeling the pinch of fuel prices and who are looking for a greener alternative
8324415 these new programs help give customers a shorter payback period to realize their return on investment
8324416 our customers are telling us i want volvo to give me the most fuel efficient truck possible we need every bit of help we can get to survive the escalation in diesel prices
8324417 but we realized we can give them far more than the truck fuelwatch is our way to bring volvos deep knowledge of fuel economy to customers in a way that delivers these benefits throughout the entire life and operation of their trucks using less fuel is good for customers and its also good for the environment
8324418 fuelwatch allows customers to take the best specifications and use them most efficiently and most productively to drive success
8324419 we know from our experience however that even the best and maintained truck can deliver poor fuel economy if the driver lacks the knowledge and training to use it efficiently the driver has the biggest impact good or bad on fuel economy
8324420 we think the days of inexpensive fuel are over and the trucking industry must adapt to this new reality
8324421 fuelwatch is not a switch that fleets can throw or a part they can bolt on a truck this is a partnership between volvo our customers and our dealers involving a comprehensive approach to improving fuel economy tailored to the individual customer were confident the fuelwatch process will play an important role in their success

8324426 watching the execution left me with horror and emptiness confirming what i had already come to realize capital punishment only continues the violence that has a powerful corrosive effect on society

8324436 it is dealing with growth and stuff that you can predict and some that you cant and you just dont know whats going to happen
8324437 an area especially this part of jefferson road that was primarily business and industry and commercial has changed tremendously and changed all to commerical and all to retail
8324438 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
8324439 for me he brings a working class cultural background growing up in scranton and working class areas in delaware i feel like he takes his catholic faith very seriously i think that he will culturally connect to the kinds of voters obama needs to win
8324440 i think thats another signal that obama is willing to find common ground in the middle on the abortion issue biden has a very moderate position on it i think really he can talk about it in terms of his catholic faith that hes against abortion but doesnt think criminalization is the answer
8324441 im very glad that he picked a catholic vice president
8324442 reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
8324443 i dont think its going to work in this instance when youre talking about a social conservative view point
8324444 hes definitely not as extreme as obama on these issues but hes still pro abortion he still supports that right
8324445 its probably a smart move but it will probably backlash
8324446 i am not running for senate i am not running for senate
8324447 a number of participants worried about the possibility that core inflation might fail to moderate next year unless the stance of monetary policy was tightened sooner than currently anticipated by financial markets
8324448 there is a big split on the fomc no doubt about that
8324449 we know there is a severe credit crunch but it is difficult outside the housing market to pin down how much impact it is having on the economy
8324450 while the financial system remained fragile and economic growth was sluggish and could weaken further fisher saw a greater risk to the economy from upward pressures on inflation
8324451 if anything i read this as the vast majority preaching patience as far as inflation
8324452 if you were to describe yourself with six words what would those words be
8324453 what if we looked at the world through gods eyes
8324454 todays tools are able to manage various types of content and put specific types of content onto specific devices
8324455 what is truly needed however and what we expect to see emerge over the next few years are tools that unlock the value of content in the digital age by formatting and managing content for device independence when content becomes reusable across multiple delivery channels its value increases enormously which will foster investment in developing the next generation of content management tools

8324460 a slowdown in world growth has taken the pressure off commodity prices slower growth will help keep inflation down generally and as long as inflation is no problem the fed doesnt have to raise rates which will keep the slowdown from hitting too hard
8324461 world economies catch us malaise pain of slowdown spreads far and wide threatening businesses and growth
8324462 well i guess you should use this year to try to figure out what you want to do in life
8324463 id like to but i dont even know how you figure these things out so far nothing interests me enough for me to want to make a career out of it but i know im going to have to do something and im afraid im just going to have to fake it to pretend to be interested in something because im really not very interested in anything so i dont know what to do
8324464 what usually happens is that you begin doing something first then you become interested in it
8324465 youre getting rid of them all yesterday your wife was here sending someone off i guess it was her brother i guess the children are going back to school too bad its always kind of sad at the end of the summer
8324466 mothers usually they come in with their sons and daughters they get tears in their eyes not all of them of course some seem pleased to get rid of them
8324467 but i dont think your wife was very happy she probably feels like now shes all alone at the house well with you ha ha
8324468 and the weather is changing too there was a mist over the fields this morning
8324469 well its always the same everybody comes down here in the early summer

8324475 i dont understand women who dont like being with the girls they say theyd rather be with the guys all the time that its just so much easier im calling bulls on that
8324476 she reminds me of one of those women back in the 40s and 50s shes a broad and i want to be a broad i mean shes like ava gardner or bette davis or katherine hepburn those women were broads they said it like it was
8324477 i was raised by parents who didnt have much we didnt use whole pieces of paper towel we shared or used rags mom didnt even want us flushing all the time
8324478 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8324479 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound
8324480 its going to accelerate climate change through changes in the reflectance of the arctic
8324481 its going from bright ice to a much darker ocean
8324482 that allows for the breakdown of that by bacteria and other organisms that release co2 or methane depending on how the breakdown occurs
8324483 right now my plan is to actually start trent so that he can get prepared for a game as if he were the starter which obviously means not planning on playing marc bulger
8324484 marc has a lot of snaps in preseason trent has really had limited work and i think could use some time out there on the field
8324485 this gives him a chance in a game to go out and find his rhythm
8324486 so hes not going in the season cold without reps if we ever called upon him
8324487 you cant assume that just because hes a vet that knows the system that he can just go out there and turn it on although i would bet on him more than a lot of guys

8324508 quisiera hoy detenerme en algunos puntos de la biograf a de san pablo el ap stol naci en tarso de cilicia hebreo de la di spora hablaba griego no obstante tuviera un nombre de origen latino y gozara de la ciudadan a romana tal vez aprendi de su padre a tejer la lana para fabricar tiendas de campa a trasladado a jerusal n con unos doce a os fue formado por el rabino gamaliel el viejo en las r gidas normas del farise smo mostrando un gran celo por la ley mosaica lo que le llev a perseguir a los cristianos
8324509 experiment un gran cambio camino de damasco llegando a ser un ap stol infatigable del evangelio realiz tres viajes misioneros el primero con bernab en el segundo escogi como compa eros a silas y timoteo durante el tercero pablo fue arrestado en jerusal n por los jud os a causa de un malentendido
8324510 tras permanecer un tiempo en prisi n habiendo apelado al c sar el procurador porcio festo lo envi a roma donde pas dos a os en una casa custodiado por un soldado tradiciones sucesivas hablan de que pablo fue liberado y pudo realizar desde roma un viaje a espa a y otro a oriente otras tradiciones se alan que fue encarcelado una segunda vez acabando sus d as martirizado

8324512 este breve relato de los viajes de san pablo es suficiente para comprender como l se dedic al anuncio del evangelio sin guardarse energ as afrontando una serie de pruebas graves de las que ha dejado su testimonio en la segunda carta a los corintios del resto escribe
8324513 vemos entonces un esfuerzo que se explica solo con un alma realmente fascinada por la luz del evangelio enamorada de cristo un alma sostenida por una convicci n profunda es necesario llevar al mundo la luz de cristo anunciar el evangelio a todos
8324514 el evangelio intuir as la grandeza la belleza tambi n la necesidad profunda del evangelio para todos nosotros rogamos para que el se or que ha hecho ver su luz a pablo nos haga ver a nosotros su luz para que nuestro coraz n sea tocado por su palabra y podamos as darle al mundo de hoy que tiene sed de ella la luz del evangelio y la verdad de cristo

8324735 talk to him about anything talk to him about the olympics or what he thinks about a certain congressional district or even about the new york times sunday crossword puzzle obama could even put the phone in a drawer and just let president clinton talk away it wouldnt take much it could be so easy
8324736 i could see that clinton might have endorsed him obama has a lot of attributes he values
8324737 one difference between the two guys is that obama never had an uncle buddy who lived in a trailer
8324738 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
8324739 you can only have certainty about a fixed election date in the context of a majority government
8324740 look if any of the opposition parties wanted to provide some any degree of certainty that well be here to october 2009 then well have an election in october 2009

8324746 ive been burned by politicians before that i wanted to believe in and just didnt live up to it
8324747 and i was afraid to trust him and i was afraid to have hope when i first kind of became aware of him
8324748 i just said i cant deny how i feel about you barack obama i want you to be the president i want you in the white house

8324750 the capital markets crunch has hit main street leaving many entrepreneurs in need of financing in the lurch
8324751 alex vantarakis company connects buyers and sellers of small companies giving him a front row seat to the turmoils impact on main street he didnt see it at first he said but realizes now that lenders started pulling back on capital around the first of the year regardless of how solid the underlying business
8324752 get back to normal there is also the uneasy feeling that were never going back to that strange place
8324753 and some experts say it could stay that way for years
8324754 sorry we cant give you the sale price but this is indeed an issue with our servers so were going to try to fix it for future customers
8324755 sorry that happened since its such a specific sale call in to and well place your order and make sure you get the sale price and were going to try to fix this so future customers wont have this problem
8324756 slowly we struggled to even recognise our own son i would catch him staring into space and being totally silent if we questioned him he would lose his temper we used to worry he was schizophrenic
8324757 when the prison handed the poems over we couldnt believe it
8324758 this really made us all reflect on our own lives we can relate to exactly what kevin has gone through and understand the power of the words drugs take over your life
8324759 drugs devastated our family if kevins poems can save one person from making the same mistakes he did all the pain will be worth it
8324760 i think you know when you have met the one and within a month i knew i wanted to spend the rest of my life with jo and have children
8324761 i got something called diverticular disease which infects the large intestine and needed an operation so the wedding plans were postponed
8324762 we had operations around the same time and have matching scars joannes situation is much worse than mine and i thought i would lose her on more than one occasion she has been very very ill and had several doses of chemotherapy it has been horrendous but she has been so brave a real fighter
8324763 the competition was for couples who have not been able to get married due to unforeseen circumstances and seemed to relate very much to our story we are not very traditional and we had been planning to marry in a field in posh clothes and wellies
8324764 they will all be invited to the wedding and part of the money will be spent on makeovers for them all
8324765 im trying to find a way to feel normal again
8324766 i had pangs of fear as i approached the end because i knew it meant i would have to start doing something other than cycling again
8324767 in total ive had had about 270 different passengers on the bike as companions to help and direct me but when you add in all the people i gave joy rides to it comes to about 500
8324768 one of the most memorable characters was a homeless hitchhiker in alaska who was 65 years old and about 200 kilometres from civilisation when i picked him up he was very excited because he had actually heard about me on the radio he was just hilarious
8324769 this has been life changing in so many ways and im still mentally struggling to come to terms with it being over i set out at a time of change in my life and now im returning itll be difficult to accept that so much will have changed again its almost going to be like starting life afresh
8324770 i had a guy who threatened me in mexico but one or two scares aside i think the real story is about positive experiences
8324771 it was difficult to balance a cycling trip and getting to know and understand people while sticking a camera in their faces
8324772 i certainly have enough material for a book and i think the video footage will speak for itself
8324773 you could see the wall was bulging under the pressure of the rain
8324774 we made sure customers did not park where the wall looked most dangerous by parking our cars there now both of them look to be written off
8324775 the road drains have been blocked for a long time and i have made at least 15 requests to the council since january for action to be taken i have also reported my concern about the way the wall was bulging
8324776 the rain runs down from wharmton hill above greenfield station and the water pressure has drilled a hole right under the land onto the road
8324777 you could see it building up as it couldnt escape fast enough
8324778 our initial response was to fence off the affected area so that public safety was maintained we have been in contact with contractors who will make the remaining exposed embankment safe
8324779 this is not just a mosque there will be lots of community facilities
8324780 it will give the youth somewhere to go it will not just be for the use of that community we will be engaging with the wider community including the inter faith forum
8324781 there is a lot of merit in this application but green areas are our lungs
8324782 anti social behaviour is a problem in this area there are no youth facilities and this is much needed
8324783 there may be a problem if white youths came in to use facilities when women were there
8324784 they wouldnt want asian youths going in while women were there either
8324785 it is not the case that non muslims would not be welcome non muslims already visit mosques in glodwick and werneth and are well received the facility is a necessity because there has been an expansion in that community
8324786 some youths in the area spend the night smoking drugs and getting involved in anti social behaviour this would give them somewhere to go
8324787 for me the medication had a massive affect straight away but i didnt realise until it was too late
8324788 i started spending money left right and centre and became addicted to internet shopping channels at one point i had nine credit cards full of these gadgets id bought but didnt need they just sat in the house
8324789 it was frightening i was sat in my chair and seeing these strange figures in the room i was so terrified i refused to move and sat in the chair for an entire day thats when i started to get help and was told of similar compulsive behaviour
8324790 its comforting to know there are others out there i cant explain how frightening this has all been
8324791 but the constant complaints about them showing the wrong times has been very embarrassing
8324792 it is better they are stopped completely until the problem is sorted out
8324793 i have made scores of calls to the council but i have just been fobbed off
8324794 the fact the clock does not work properly makes it look as if the church does not care which is totally untrue its not long since parshioners paid to have the clock faces refurbished and gold leaf restored we have a real pride in them
8324795 due to budgetary demands we have so far been unable to begin work on the saddleworth parish church clock
8324796 when hes on that bike something clicks and hes like another person
8324797 like any mother in those situations sometimes my heart is in my mouth but i remember that joe could get injured walking down the street so this is no different
8324798 its a great hobby for him to do itll keep him off the streets and away from trouble when hes a bit older and may lead to a career
8324799 not just the travel costs its the bike and equipment and the entry fees
8324800 thats why sponsorship is really important he is doing so well we dont want to have to stop
8324801 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses

8324860 i used to get angry when this happened now i just get depressed
8324861 i think last year i was a little more angry now im just rolling with the punches
8324862 i guess if 10 years ago somebody told me id be in nascar part time or anything i would have told them they were crazy
8324863 i feel proud of the kind of unique career ive carved out in motorsports i just love being part of the sport
8324864 i was driving back in a box truck from florida and stopped about 2 in the morning at a car dealership
8324865 i hooked up the hose in the back and was showering and all of a sudden a cop pulled up and told me i couldnt stay there i just drove next door and it just happened to be tom milners building i didnt even know it until he woke me up in the morning
8324866 he was almost like a father to me when i was struggling in racing he kept me employed
8324867 all my life people have told me it cant be done but im a firm believer that if you work hard enough it can be done ive proved it
8324868 given the opportunity with a full time sponsor we could compete with these guys weve shown we can do it every time we race
8324869 i think he brings a lot of entertainment to the series wed love to see him out there all the different types of cars that hes driven and hes had success in proves what kind of race car driver he is
8324870 hes all about giving and just a huge asset to our sport
8324871 his personality is second to none larger than life id love to see him full time and i think if he ever got the right chance with the right people he could make it work
8324872 frightened i see guys like jeff gordon and dale earnhardt jr and in all their fan clubs there are cute little girls yelling their name
8324873 heres an ethical principle heres a situation that might in principle come up is the principle plausible in that case
8324874 if the tax rate were 100 percent no one would work
8324875 yes i agree the marginal tax rate should be somewhere between 0 and 100 percent

8324877 right now im just trying to get my blood pumping pretty much ive been doing a little bit of training
8324878 i know the celebrations will wait until i get home so im not worried
8324879 i am just trying to come here and let the fans enjoy my performance because they come here to see a performance
8324880 he hasnt really had time to get rest and training
8324881 but he is still pretty much in good shape and he will put on a good show on friday
8324882 i cant do it on my own personally but the other guys definitely are stepping up i think track and field is getting better
8324883 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8324884 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event
8324885 i have always worked with my agent to stay here and i was proud other clubs wanted to sign me
8324886 valencia have preferred to keep me rather than to cash in on the large amount of money that was being offered i have to thank them for everything they have done for me and for the effort they have made
8324887 i love my country i love what we stand for
8324888 the fortunate thing for me is that i know where i came from and i know where im going which is i think when you know that and you understand that you can pretty much take on anything
8324889 it just means the same thing its meant the last two months well go with what we have
8324890 the statesman was attempting to gain a monopoly on the publication of a broad scope of legal notices contrary to the idaho constitution and we believe the legislatures intent when they amended the act in 1994

8324917 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8324918 theres a strong chance that by friday we could see some fairly significant pump price increases
8324919 crude can be replaced and brought in via tanker but bringing a damaged refinery back up again can take a long time as we saw with katrina and rita

8324923 federal revenues should have been down nearly 20 billion in the first quarter given the measures set out in last falls economic statement
8324924 instead only a 1 1 billion reduction is showing up in the national accounts
8324925 bullish u s durable goods data solid oil inventory numbers and the fact that crude had already started to retreat from session highs as hurricane gustav was downgraded to a tropical storm have all combined to ensure the dollar can resume its upward trend
8324926 where adverse economic conditions have resulted in reduced print advertising
8324927 if indeed its a repeat of katrina and rita were in for some troubling times
8324928 the nano project is an unique and innovative initiative which will establish indias position as a small car hub
8324929 this unrest will be counter productive for the countrys economic growth its global image as well as our ability to attract investments from across the world
8324930 indian industry must be encouraged to make such large investments in order to build the countrys competitiveness as well as support job creation
8324931 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana
8324932 im going to make sure im here personally to lead the preparation efforts and if necessary any recovery efforts necessary after the fact
8324933 oil markets are keeping a nervous eye on gustav with forecasts showing it may move into the gulf of mexico
8324934 evacuating personnel not essential to producing and drilling operations in the gulf
8324935 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8324936 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines
8324937 she never really answered the key question is he prepared to be president which is the issue she put out there rather dramatically during the primaries
8324938 standing on that stage tonight in front of 20 000 democrats unified behind senator obama i saw a bright future for america
8324939 i saw millions of people across the country working as one to elect the next democratic president
8324940 im sad that were not standing here talking about her running for president but we have to abide by her wishes
8324941 i didnt even know i won this tournament thats how long it has been
8324942 therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants
8324943 it is the announcement that what follows will be profoundly impactful in our present journey as kingdom people
8324944 it demands all of our attention and all of our commitment to see and to believe
8324945 my dad didnt mean to hurt me its just that he worked a lot and cared so much for our family that he never had time for me how can i hold that against him
8324946 i know that gods love unconditional but do you see this big word unless
8324947 these give us our forgiveness gameplan and they are very clear in keeping with our tradition of being painfully practical i will give you some challenges in direct language
8324948 and then tells the parable of the forgiving king and the unforgiving servant mt 18 22
8324949 you dont owe me any more dont ever try to pay me back again you are free in my heart i know you are sorry and i forgive you
8324950 i have let them go they do not owe me anymore
8324951 all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ
8324952 that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them
8324953 and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation
8324954 when a word ceases to be a term of description and becomes merely a term of praise it no longer tells you facts about the object it only tells you about the speakers attitude to that object
8324955 there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to one hope when you were called one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all
8324956 we have to be at the church building by five oclock for prayer
8324957 our worship center is on the corner of main and 3rd
8324958 this gathering is much more charismatic in its expression of the gifts
8324959 i feel especially fit to serve the church in dallas
8324960 the church in our city is coming alive and many of our fellowships are growing
8324961 the church in africa is challenged to understand so many different imported traditions
8324962 the pastor of our fellowship really has a heart for the church of the area
8324963 can you differentiate who you pastor and who you teach on sunday mornings
8324964 god calls me to serve the church and i am presently working for this fellowship
8324965 father we lift up the believers that meet at first baptist downtown and we bless their leaders and all the people to prosper and to enjoy you today
8324966 we just wanted to say we love you and support you may god bless this no matter how you choose to spend it
8324967 sponsored by part of the church of our dear city
8324968 then well start looking at proposed remedial work and cost
8324969 it is a significant recognition of all the hard work we do at the centre to make every swimmers experience in our facility safe and enjoyable
8324970 for the different people using the facility this highlights the safe environment they come to use
8324971 for staff this indicates there is recognition and a career path for those who put in an effort to develop their skills
8324972 and for the centre it indicates the quality of service and training happening as it is able to produce staff that can excel
8324973 the strong personal commitment kane showed towards health and safety within the aquatic environment
8324974 this was particularly noticeable in kane because he was quite young at the time and he had minimal experience
8324975 he resolves customer conflict when the need arises and has willingness to take on whatever is required for the greater good of the community he serves
8324976 i was at a party dancing when a guy aimed a glock gun at my temple it was one of the defining moments of my life
8324977 i was also in a drive by shooting where i shouldve got shot but wasnt
8324978 when you look into the eyes of death you get new hope you start seeing things differently
8324979 i saw a lot of murder and death on a big scale i saw people marched into the bushes who never came back
8324980 it made me realise what was important in life it made me see things differently
8324981 managing work and three kids and writing late at night was tough but it was healing for me because as cops we dont often talk about what we see
8324982 its come 63 years later and i was pleasantly surprised but if nothing had happened i wouldnt have taken any notice
8324983 i was milking cows and trimming bushes back then everything the men used to do before they had to fight overseas
8324984 i loved it it was good camaraderie and we were all friends
8324985 the educational side of the new park will give people ways to take care of their waterways into the future
8324986 people dont realise that things like washing cars with detergents and using fertilisers near drains can contribute to degrading our waterways because the chemicals can end up in the water system
8324987 the phosphate they produce in their waste is a contributor to the algal blooms that degrade the lakes
8324988 we are trying to educate the public into not feeding them bread which is actually bad for the birds and for the lakes and to feed them away from the water
8324989 the park will be an example of best environmental practice not just for the public but for developers also
8324990 i love playing older people because theres not a lot of pressure on you and theres a greater sense of exhilaration if you win
8324991 i wasnt expecting to win any of them the first time because it was my first ever nationals
8324992 i couldnt believe that id actually won it just didnt get through my head at all
8324993 i want to use it as an experience and to get used to the atmosphere of playing at that level i can then try to work harder on the areas i need to improve and test myself again
8324994 at the moment im doing eight times a week from monday to friday
8324995 it was a very good day for our waitakere teams all three age groups competed and played to a very high level throughout the day
8324996 although these days are for development purposes it is nice for the boys to taste some success against other regions and they are now really displaying some pride while representing wai takere
8324997 as a winger for 10 years i do feel we need other wide options
8324998 we need players who can play wide and im sure benitez is looking for that
8324999 when i was playing most teams played with wingers there was myself and peter thompson at liverpool
8325000 i think it wasnt until 1966 when england won the world cup and i was a member of the squad that alf
8325001 the benefits of this investment were immediately realised with a positive swing in profitability in the last quarter of the financial year when commercial production commenced
8325002 we purchased the assets of the gallard and mirage group in october 2007 and turned these into a fully operational state of the art plant within six months
8325003 we now have an appropriate raw material base for all charlies products and as we run down the stock holding of products produced by our contract packer we expect our operating cashflow to normalise
8325004 how does my determination to contribute to the perpetuation of liberties compare to that of those who founded this nation
8325005 if we dont have an official roll call vote state by state it is going to reopen a wound
8325006 i dont see any further reason to continue to carry out a pretense that shes a candidate shes not

8325009 bnz is one of many banks internationally that has seen an increase in attempted fraudulent transactions on cards recently used in the uk
8325010 every individual all 300 million of us every man woman and child is touched by this issue we all have to have food we all have to have shelter and america doesnt have the labor to support the economy
8325011 a the top end of the scale weve got people selling methamphetamine and ranging right down to people possessing cannabis
8325012 we take a hard line on drug offending and we will police drug dealers and offenders the best we can and when we can
8325013 drug dealing is ongoing we will do our best to police it but often it is very difficult because as soon as you knock one dealer over another one pops up somewhere else
8325014 there have obviously been days when they just cant work
8325015 if i ever caught them i know what i would do with them
8325016 i feel its almost a personal invasion whoever did it cant be mentally normal most people look on graves as sacred ground
8325017 were distressed about it and im sure the families affected are too its a place where 99 9 per cent of people respect it as sacred
8325018 theres going to be a lot of cow cockies finishing milking early that night so they can get here on time
8325019 it will be wonderful to see the crowds back again
8325020 over the years taranaki has made a very strong contribution to new zealand rugby and we deserve to have this test match

8325025 america is a world leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency
8325026 these projects are good for business good for the economy good for jobs and they help secure more self sufficient energy resources for our country
8325027 the last three to four weeks weve averaged 100 a day weve been working double shifts 24 7
8325028 it has been across the central and lower north island its the stormy weather of the last few weeks
8325029 about four years ago there was a bad storm it was worse farmers were caught unawares
8325030 the cows dont get knocked around by the weather and we rarely have dead calves everything is in one area it makes it easier to come to one place i dont have to put the fences up in the rain and it saves the grass and the paddocks
8325031 you keep fit doing it you push it back and it dries out during the day if youre cold you get warm pretty quickly
8325032 it is quiet and warm in there a lot of people dont believe they are all still lying down
8325033 if i spot them close to calving i put them inside once in the mud they dont like that
8325034 some people think it is cruel having them stand all day but they are a lot happier than if they were in a paddock
8325035 this is like a stand off pad but it is a treat at night to go in to sleep
8325036 work and income has told us that if john dies or if we divorce i would be entitled to the full nz super

8325039 ha habido una oferta del real madrid por el jugador de m s de 40 millones de euros
8325040 la verdad es que durante el ltimo mes y medio han sucedido muchas cosas en mi cabeza y en mi entorno cosas que no hab a vivido antes y para las que no s si estaba preparado
8325041 he de agradecer al valencia el gesto que ha hecho por m y al club todo lo que me ha dado desde que llegu hace tres a os el presidente se ha esforzado por darme cari o en los momentos que m s lo necesitaba y yo espero seguir dando el m ximo rendimiento e incluso mejorarlo
8325042 la cl usula era de 150 millones de euros y nunca iba a mover un dedo para salir del valencia
8325043 si me quieren fichar deben negociar con el valencia porque yo estoy a gusto aqu mi actual club no ha aceptado una oferta de mucho dinero y eso para mi es un orgullo en definitiva no he visto posibilidad alguna de salir de mestalla
8325044 mi evoluci n como jugador puede ser igual aqu que en el real madrid de lo contrario nunca hubiese firmado mi renovaci n espero devolver el cari o que esta afici n me da en cada entrenamiento y en cada partido
8325045 conozco a cazorla y a iker bromas de esas solemos gastar a diario
8325046 estic molt content de estar a i hui amunt valencia
8325047 el valencia y david villa van a seguir juntos muchos a os para m es un honor anunciar que el mejor delantero de europa va a seguir en nuestro equipo
8325048 por encima de las palabras aqu est n los hechos estamos elaborando un proyecto deportivo con paso firme con rigor y fe y con los pilares de la credibilidad y la ambici n ni siquiera hoy quiero acordarme de los que vaticinaron lo que hoy descartamos en el valencia hacen falta hombres con valor en el campo y respeto por la afici n como es david
8325049 es un mensaje claro y rotundo para el resto del mundo del f tbol y algunos de sus dirigentes el valencia no se va a dejar intimidar por nadie con el valencia se va de frente y con las cartas encima de la mesa no aceptamos otra forma de actuar
8325050 a la afici n hemos de decirle que tenga tranquilidad y fe que no nos den las gracias porque hacer grande al equipo es una exigencia que parte de nosotros mismos
8325051 eternal father i offer thee the wounds of our lord jesus christ to heal those of our souls

8325060 every year people look forward to stopping at our kansas wheat booth to pick up our annual recipe book before they leave the fairgrounds
8325061 this year our recipe book features 12 recipes that were submitted by dietitians and fitness leaders from hospitals across the state of kansas
8325062 the theme of the book is eat to be fit
8325063 book which highlights the first 50 years of the kansas wheat commission
8325064 we could not function for 11 days without the help of our kansas speak for wheat spokespersons
8325065 these are men and women from across the state that volunteer their time and talk to consumers
8325066 this is an excellent opportunity for kansas wheat to connect not only with producers but the end users of their products

8325082 like it or not one of the most important features of any microsoft office alternative is being able to read microsoft office files sco goes down and suns in trouble
8325083 the decision is in and sco has gone down in defeat the u s district court in utah has ruled in favor of novell in sco vs linux for the kids linuxworld install fest
8325084 over the last few years linuxworld has become the trade show for linux the business rather than linux the community this zenwalk continues to impress with 5 2 beta
8325085 while our friends at distrowatch only rate zenwalk as the 19th most popular linux distribution we have been very impressed by their
8325086 ever since the open source section of the community set out to woo business in the late 1990s many involved with foss have been unsure how to regard business

8325088 whats hack week hack week is a chance for novells developers to work on innovation time off ito projects is ubuntu really the most user friendly distribution

8325100 gaming can be an emotional journey for many different audiences and not just an aggressive experience for young males
8325101 jenova chen exemplifies what it means to be an innovator he pushes the boundaries of his industry questioning assumptions about what gaming can be because of his breakthrough vision the impact from his approach to gaming will be felt for generations to come

8325104 you might have thought he would have known that before he either entered here or pulled out of here
8325105 most of us would have liked to see him trying to qualify
8325106 there can be no underestimating the impact of wilkinsons actions his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people
8325107 here we have an armoury factory in the suburbs of berkshire creating deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17 18 19 year olds in inner city urban london
8325108 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets they have caused devastating shootings murders and mayhem
8325109 the crown prosecution service wishes to make it clear that this prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8325110 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8325111 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one
8325112 because it teaches them to take turns when they go down the slide
8325113 friends for life is our first feature film in more than a decade we knew we had a good story about family and faith were pleased that it was so well received by this discerning group of international family and faith filmmakers
8325114 the icvma crown awards are truly international in nature with entries from as far away as germany and india

8325116 my job demanded a lot and i gave it 100 percent
8325117 i kept up with every one of my male co workers
8325118 affected my familys quality of life then and they affect my retirement now
8325119 what you really want is a missing cell type one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else but you only want that cell type so i think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work by this gene over expression procedure
8325120 provides exciting new insights into yet another aspect of cell plasticity that was not appreciated previously and that offers great potential therapeutically direct reprogramming represents a more straight forward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell
8325121 more than a little surprised to find that we could use a combination of just three transcription factors to reprogram one cell type into another
8325122 combined a systematic approach to identifying the relevant transcription factors hard work and a bit of luck
8325123 by asking what genes you have to have turned on in the cell for it to become a beta cell
8325124 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind
8325125 and the locks are transcription factors we asked which ones are present in the beta cell and that gave us 1 100 transcription factors to choose from eventually we learned that of the 1 100 only about 200 are actually expressed in cells that are involved in forming the pancreas
8325126 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8325127 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8325128 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
8325129 were intrigued by the possibility that this approach which has worked for pancreatic insulin producing cells could be more widely applied to many kind of cells especially those that are lost in disease or following injury
8325130 and at the same time we are exploring the possibility of using this general approach in a clinical context to make new beta cells for patients
8325131 sudden decompressions are seriously frightening but hardly ever dangerous the only people who love them are journalists
8325132 we expect new aircraft will drive the growth and the resulting honeymoon effect of low maintenance requirements could keep mro spend down
8325133 aviation safety bill of 2008 which is awaiting approval by the senate in the us would create a new office with the countrys aviation industry regulator the federal aviation administration that would deal with safety concerns

8325158 i was out walking in the desert one morning not paying attention to where i was going you know just walking
8325159 after i got up i tossed a rock at it to move it back into the light didnt budge so i tossed another rock at it i know what youre thinking i should have gotten the hell out of there but it wasnt like i was scared or anything the snake coiled the color froze me i stood in my tracks

8325161 there is no end to the liminal matrix where gods and monsters play
8325162 harper began the tour in tuktoyaktuk with an announcement on arctic sovereignty essentially arguing canada should extend its jurisdictional reach into the arctic ocean doubling it from 100 nautical miles to 200 nautical miles
8325163 this is important because with global warming more and more ships are coming into the arctic
8325164 the shipping season is longer and there are very serious disputes with some of canadas allies including the americans who believe the northwest passage is international waters
8325165 that way no matter what appliances you might encounter during your nocturnal espionage you can plug them right in theres nothing worse than midnight corporate skullduggery interrupted by a mr coffee thats got no juice

8325173 this cat thinks hes gonna be in paradise by the end of the week
8325174 youre an egghead who got dragged into a street fight
8325175 you must be willing to sacrifice some of your pawns if you want to win the game
8325176 this is a war you do what it takes to win
8325177 we use violence only because it has been used against us

8325185 we will be back with the family in four years before the parole board to ensure that morales remains in prison where he will be unable to hurt another innocent person in our society
8325186 wtf i kept wondering what were they were thinking surely its the work of indecisive committee
8325187 this has been a very important and a very encouraging meeting said de boer
8325188 the process has speeded up and governments are becoming very serious about negotiating a result
8325189 accra shows that overcoming the muddle of conflicting views and crafting an effective deal to tackle climate change is possible
8325190 we are running out of time on this problem from the scientific point of view
8325191 a potential trigger of rapid and abrupt and extreme climate change
8325192 the poor want to lead a dignified life a life that is secure
8325193 they need to develop and the opportunity unfortunately is linked to having energy
8325194 on how quickly a u s team can be put in place how fast they can get their positions sorted out and when they can start to negotiate
8325195 we must open the doors of opportunity but we must also equip people to walk through those doors

8325197 the midwest has a rich history of being pioneers in agricultural production and research and now throughout the heartland there are many pioneers in agriculture and bio renewables that are changing the world for the better
8325198 was formed to ensure the american public understands and takes pride in the resources and technological advancements the ag industry has made to benefit america and the world
8325199 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
8325200 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is working night and day to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop fighting
8325201 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never
8325202 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within
8325203 my friendship is eternal my ability to care at all costs is immeasurable my heart soul and spirits depth belong to only one man i am a woman of truth even in my humanness and i will always be perfectly flawed
8325204 freedom soars on wings outstretched upon the wind of kindness but limitless is the sky when feathers have been strengthened by honest self reflection
8325205 that she was a strong candidate for the money partly because women were underrepresented on the course
8325206 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8325207 but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8325208 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8325209 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8325210 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8325211 thats really lous domain as to how far he wants to let it go
8325212 its one of those fine lines you dont want to take away those emotions but at the same time im sure lou gets to the point to where if he feels like he needs to talk to him im sure he does or he has its not something i worry about when youve got lou piniella in the dugout i dont need to go down there and tell them how to act
8325213 i just have to work on my delivery and thats it
8325214 just go home and go to the hotel sleep well wake up have a good game get out of here go home see my daughter you know and be ready for sunday
8325215 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
8325216 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is working night and day to make you like everybody else means to fight the hardest battle any human being can fight and never stop fighting
8325217 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never

8325220 freedom soars on wings outstretched upon the wind of kindness but limitless is the sky when feathers have been strengthened by honest self reflection
8325221 it is a serious decision and we havent made it lightly
8325222 in the end in politics youve got to do whats right and im asking the new zealand public to trust us and to back us to be a government that has integrity
8325223 it is very clear now that winston peters has misled the public of new zealand
8325224 i have received an explanation which is that he refutes the suggestions made by glenn
8325225 i think that i have a duty to be fair and we are in the middle of a parliamentary process the privileges committee is meeting it is considering evidence and that is where the matter lies at the moment
8325226 we have a conflict of evidence we have allegations we dont have an outcome
8325227 this ignores the realities of policing where an emergency could require all sworn staff to report to frontline duty at a moments notice
8325228 how can we vote for fee increases of 5 in the college of arts given the reduction in their budgets this year
8325229 there has been a huge reduction in academic staff and the operational budget which has impacted on tutorials this does not reflect an increase in quality
8325230 just putting up fees by 500 is not making this a better university and its not making it a better research facility
8325231 if i was an arts student there is no way i would come to canterbury as a student it really scares me whats happened to the arts faculty and it could happen somewhere else
8325232 our pleas to the government for the university sector have actually been ignored comprehensively over recent years
8325233 its partly staff its partly facilities and its partly trying to improve the quality of the experience for students
8325234 nonfiction ive always been a huge exaggerator but when i write something i put it on a scale and if its 97 true i think thats true enough im not going to call it fiction because 3 of it isnt true
8325235 you know whats so wonderful about you schulz you cant sing worth a damn but it never stops you
8325236 in the beginning there was the word the word was in gods presence and the word was god
8325237 i gleefully mock the policies and practices of the usg that i consider worthy of mocking in doing so i am exercising a fundamental constitutional freedom of course you are always welcome to disagree and exercise your constitutional rights
8325238 i mean when people have money invested and theres 20 000 new zealanders investing in the company you expect something a little bit better than that from the chairman
8325239 its very unsatisfactory but thats been him all along hes a doer not a communicator
8325240 there is also a deferred tax adjustment of 58m which is purely ifrs international financial reporting standards nonsense and can be safely disregarded
8325241 i dont think we can overestimate his impact on new zealand business
8325242 i will find out something at the end of the week i hope in the near future anyway
8325243 but it is looking very likely that i will be going back to europe
8325244 there has been some positive talk and it is a big goal of my mine to go back
8325245 i have always wanted to go back ever since i decided to quit the big team discovery over there it is really hard to get back in there at the moment because a lot of teams are stopping it is supply and demand
8325246 there are a lot of riders on the market and very little teams
8325247 to get back over there will be very very hard but i am quite confident i can go back
8325248 i will have a rest mentally i wont be doing any training for the next two to three weeks but i will be doing something mountain biking running or the gym just to keep fit
8325249 it is all overwhelming to be honest it seems so long ago since i won the medals that everyone would have forgotten its mind blowing to see everyone here
8325250 he alex has been annoyed because he really enjoys riding his bike to school
8325251 now i have to drive him to school and its eating into our petrol money which there isnt much of when youre on a benefit
8325252 this is more of a goodwill gesture than anything else
8325253 all of us except for hayden roulston want to stay together as much as we can for the next four years a couple of those guys in the great britain squad are getting old now and theyre probably not going to be around forever
8325254 with another four years and a world championship under our belt we think we can get up there put it this way weve definitely got room for improvement
8325255 to come so close and not get it 6000 left me a bit disappointed id set myself a high standard and to come home with just one pb personal best out of the seven events was a little disappointing
8325256 but i went in ranked 22nd and came out 22nd so i cant complain
8325257 i finished fourth in the commonwealth in beijing and didnt even do a pb score so definitely think its possible as for london id say possibly
8325258 die essenz der methode ist zu dem unbeweglichem zentrum in der mitte der bewegung zu gelangen dem raum von bewusster wahrnehmung
8325259 to have five gentlemen support me without really even knowing me and just going on one guys word was pretty mind blowing i am so thankful they came along because at that time it was really causing a lot of stress as it does when you are short of funds
8325260 i cant thank them enough they say it was nothing to them but to me it was everything
8325261 they provided me with the chance to be stress free in the build up for the olympics
8325262 but the bigger impacts are still to come in terms of the way competition is changing in the sector
8325263 we dont expect the other banks to be as competitive as they were last year

8325276 if i heard that word gigahertz one more time i was going to scream
8325277 how can i bring my love of music and my skills and love of electronics and bring those two things together a light bulb went off
8325278 apple computer has been successfully convincing the youth of the world that their little things are high fidelity
8325279 if i heard that word gigahertz one more time i was going to scream
8325280 how can i bring my love of music and my skills and love of electronics and bring those two things together a light bulb went off
8325281 apple computer has been successfully convincing the youth of the world that their little things are high fidelity
8325282 im sorry to tell you this but im in a state of euphoria
8325283 we cant either it looks like it narrows here to the left though you think we can push through there
8325284 okay well go in first and try to push through and make an opening
8325285 no i dont think so its too big and its lodged in
8325286 okay then ill walk the boat and get out on the other side and well pull it over
8325287 were going to lift the boat over the logs here theres no way to clear a channel it doesnt extend much beyond here so theres not far to go to get to open water
8325288 did yall see how we did that can yall do that
8325289 see there it looks like an apartment building see the windows
8325290 yeah three on the bottom two in the middle three on the top
8325291 at the moment we still dont know what the schedule of the weekend will be
8325292 i believe i can talk as a gpda grand prix drivers association member but also as a race driver we are a little bit concerned
8325293 we go there we havent tested we dont have any idea its going to be a night race its going to be the rainy season so its not exactly what you really want from a safety point of view
8325294 there is absolutely nothing going on in terms of signing with anybody in f1
8325295 theres not even any negotiations in that sense first i still have to understand who has the best options for me to follow then we can start negotiating but at the moment were still seeking those best options
8325296 im doing all the things i have to do chatting to the right people in the f1 paddock and well see how it turns out
8325297 lets say the only team i havent spoken to at all is ferrari so theres no real logical place for me to go yet
8325298 weve spoken to many many people about the best option in both the short and long terms theres no point in doing something for next year and then having nothing for 2010 or 2011
8325299 its a tough time now it might look very good because people are saying hes looking good in gp2 and hes obviously going to f1 but really where how i need to find a space a good space
8325300 at the moment im considering everything preferably a race drive would be a better option because i dont want to stop racing for a whole year
8325301 in my opinion its important to deliver sometimes things dont go your way but trust me ill only give up on the gp2 title when i have no more chance to win im pretty sure i can do a good job
8325302 heikkis much more adept at switching effortlessly between engine saving brake saving and tyre saving modes and he knows exactly when to push so the situation he encountered at the start of the year when he was dealing with slightly more tyre degradation is no longer a concern
8325303 i am not sure what we saw in valencia was mixed again and in the second run in qualifying two it was almost a perfect lap he was struggling before in two specific areas of the track and in that one lap he was able to do that very cleanly
8325304 i hope it gives him the confidence to be strong again in the races he has been strong i think he will be back on track
8325305 it has to because if you look what you can do from p10 it is limited
8325306 in f1 stability is an important factor that is what i can say
8325307 that applies to the driver as well as to the key engineers even the operational tasks
8325308 in hungary the results were better than normal and we were quite happy with the performance of the tyres but everyone was happy with the performance of the tyres on sunday because in hungary the grip was going up and sunday was okay for everybody
8325309 i think we need a test maybe this week in monza to really compare the tyres because in the race weekends the conditions change so much from friday to sunday you never know if it is worth what we do or not
8325310 its just putting them through a gentle duty cycle to make the tyre more resilient for the race
8325311 for me it was the key moment of the race
8325312 i dont know if it was the team or the driver who made the error but first of all i cannot understand why the stewards made their decision only after the race
8325313 they have all the information that is needed to make a judgement during the grand prix
8325314 obama and the impossible job what are the personal qualities that have distinguished the nations greatest presidents and does this nominee have them
8325315 when the clintons rise to occasion they do it in spades
8325316 entered into a binding licensing agreement with immersion and are seeking to have that agreement honored
8325317 entered into a binding licensing agreement with immersion and are seeking to have that agreement honored
8325318 entered into a binding licensing agreement with immersion and are seeking to have that agreement honored
8325319 the database was set up with the explicit reason of protection but this decision will mean it does the opposite putting eleven million children into a database is not going to help because there will be errors and mistakes
8325320 to access contactpoint police would have to make a special request directly to the secretary of state or local authority and make a clear exceptional case for disclosure
8325321 this will be decided on a case by case basis
8325322 the nation needs to wake up to what is going to happen to all its children

8325329 i had a very bad start and that caused fernando and timo glock to go in front of me
8325330 in turn 4 and 5 i think there was a bit of a battle in front of fernando and me i think he tried to avoid the car in front and i just couldnt avoid him as i was right behind
8325331 what you can do if you are committed as a government local or national
8325332 next year they just need to put in some more colour the harbour needs to be full of boats more signage and a bit more glitz but theyve got it the right way round
8325333 it requires government support and to me it is a textbook example of what you can do if you all point in the same direction and have the commitment
8325334 unfortunately we seem to be the worlds best at turning around and being unconstructively critical
8325335 a loqueeda makes up for two megans and a becky
8325336 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest
8325337 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are
8325338 oh look i see one of those users in the mirror
8325339 and if lindsay would work i could finally get some botox a motorcycle a new car some hair plugs and a penis extension i miss the good ol days when i could just live off of lindays hard work

8325447 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
8325448 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change

8325453 we have a conservative leadership many conservatives simply dont want to take care of our poor more welfare according to social darwinists just encourages the poor and then they wont work these conservatives are proud of their ruthlessness
8325454 those conservatives who do believe in helping also believe that the only help should be in the form of charity
8325455 many conservatives believe that charity is the answer to poverty
8325456 the catch is the conservative mindset that charity should only be given to people who are deserving
8325457 taking care of our own would heal us naturally but fathoms deep in the conservative mind is some dark lurching logic that weakens us something even stronger than the fear of outside threats prevents them helping their fellow americans
8325458 an absurd calculus it means that while america is the biggest exporter of food we have hunger we have poverty and blight from the outside it cannot look like america is the land of the free
8325459 getting addicted to drugs is a choice if you are mentally ill i would return you to the state run institutions that once cared for you
8325460 little known fact right here they cause 180 billion dollars in crime per year that does not even include legal fees
8325461 liberals are the ones in possession of both logic and compassion
8325462 of course your only solution is to tax conservatives oops i mean the wealthy who got that way from their own accord many of them first generationers at an ever increasing rate if liberals truely cared for the poor they would at least match what conservatives give to charity despite what you say our motives are or unfounded accusations of hand selecting recipients but liberals dont give as much because they normally dont have as much and liberalism is largely founded in an entitlement viewpoint of the world
8325463 little known fact right here they cause 180 billion dollars in crime per year that does not even include legal fees
8325464 in the great game wealth wins you dont win if everybody gets wealthy the thing about charity is that is bumps up your standing in the game without improving anyone elses standing a meaningless donation can make you look compassionate in the eyes of your peers without changing the rankings and a donation overseas gives you leverage with their government especially if it comes in the form of use only once food when the populace becomes dependent on your charity you can get concessions from their government by threatening to cut off the charity properly used charity is an investment the wealthy know it if it werent the only place you would find charity is in the dictionary
8325465 capitalism is the unequal distribution of wealth and socialism is the equal distribution of poverty
8325466 these days were all about exporting democracy and freedom to foreign counties and using war to do it the global america for export dream is us walking into mud flat third world nations nailing victory into place and unfurling the banners of abundance
8325467 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8325468 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8325469 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8325470 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8325471 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8325472 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8325473 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8325474 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8325475 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8325476 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight
8325477 particularly intriguing are the unusual categories of vocalizations and the more frequent loud harmonics evident in the btbr t tf j btbr mouse model of autism that may resemble the atypical vocalizations seen in some autistic infants
8325478 we hypothesize that ultrasonic vocalizations may be a measure of social communication in mice delayed reduced or unusual ultrasonic vocalizations in mice could offer a useful assay with reasonable face validity to the second diagnostic symptom of autism impaired communication
8325479 the doe nasa collaboration on this new observatory has been very successful and shows what can be accomplished when we work together

8325484 overnight at about 2 oclock in the morning coalition forces killed our best player rahmet wali
8325485 he had played on the afghan national cricket team from 2002 to 2006 he took part in games that were played in kuwait india and pakistan so he had made official trips to those countries as a representative of afghanistan and he brought honor to this country he was martyred in his house it was a cruel act
8325486 the study confirmed that olive leaf extract efla 943 has antihypertensive properties in humans
8325487 this works showed that taking a 1000mg dose has substantial effects in people with borderline hypertension
8325488 recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of eukaryotic genes are mispredicted at the transcript level as the mispred routines are able to detect many of these errors and may aid in their correction we suggest that it may significantly improve the quality of protein sequence data based on gene predictions
8325489 some secreted proteins may truly lack secretory signal peptides since they are subject to leaderless protein secretion similarly it cannot be excluded at present that transchromosomal chimeras can be formed and may have normal physiological functions nevertheless the fact that mispred analyses of protein sequences of the swiss prot database identified very few such exceptions indicates that the rules of mispred are generally valid
8325490 interestingly even the manually curated uniprotkb swiss prot dataset is contaminated with mispredicted or abnormal proteins although to a much lesser extent than uniprotkb trembl or the ensembl or gnomon predicted entries
8325491 the results of this study represent a potentially new therapeutic approach that of control of a biochemical cause of hypertension rather than nonspecifically lowering elevated bp although not representing a fully developed therapeutic strategy this study raises an alternative strategy that may prove to be more effective than currently available options
8325492 despite these findings this clinical trial is a small one and allopurinol is not indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adolescents or other populations the potential adverse effects of allopurinol including gastrointestinal complaints and especially stevens johnson syndrome a severe allergic reaction make allopurinol an unattractive alternative to available antihypertensive medications more clinical trials are needed to determine the reproducibility of the data and whether it can be generalized to the larger hypertensive population nevertheless the observation that lowering uric acid can reduce bp in adolescents with newly diagnosed hypertension raises intriguing questions about its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension
8325493 if you reduce uric acid at least in some patients you may be able to reduce blood pressure
8325494 this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
8325495 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for high blood pressure but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
8325496 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out
8325497 the antihypertensive therapies available to patients are well proven and safe
8325498 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure
8325499 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8325500 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8325501 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8325502 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8325503 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8325504 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8325505 he did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working its entire history not just the skeletal stuff
8325506 any time you work anywhere you have to understand this history
8325507 where a school failed to lift its performance education authorities should sack the principal replace senior staff reorganise the school or even merge it with a more efficient school

8325530 theres no provision in the constitution that autonomy will be granted to the lumad so i think this is a good piece of conversation as far as some people some observers are concerned but its not like that
8325531 if we will fully implement it this will be a good response already to their aspirations
8325532 the content of the ipra law is intended really to address the concerns of the lumad this issue is coming out because of the ancestral domain agenda with the milf they will be surprised to learn the truth that their concerns have been already addressed by the ipra law
8325533 the indigenous peoples are stakeholders in mindanao it is their land that is being discussed here historically and legally they have a big role in juridical entity
8325534 but the teduray lambiangan and dulangan manobo tribes people demanded that they be recognized as lumad that their culture be respected and that they be allowed to govern their ancestral domain according to their traditions beliefs and justice system
8325535 we want an assurance that the bangsamoro moro nation would recognize our age old peace pact with them leave to us what are ours
8325536 should the government go through a deliberate review of the moa then we must have a seat not just as observers but members who can interact with other panel members and defend and protect what are ours
8325537 there should be a third party in the peace talks there should be a separate panel composed of tribal leaders in mindanao and palawan the indigenous peoples have a right to assert recognition
8325538 if the government and the milf leaders would not hear us we would again call for a similar gathering to consult the tribes on the next step

8325545 track and field is my job this is what i do i work
8325546 right now im just trying to get my blood pumping pretty much ive been doing a little bit of training
8325547 i know the celebrations will wait until i get home so im not worried
8325548 i am just trying to come here and let the fans enjoy my performance because they come here to see a performance
8325549 he hasnt really had time to get rest and training
8325550 but he is still pretty much in good shape and he will put on a good show on friday
8325551 i cant do it on my own personally but the other guys definitely are stepping up i think track and field is getting better
8325552 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8325553 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event
8325554 its never really been too difficult for me i always thought fans were really good for me excited to see me
8325555 i guess im very close to their hearts by now
8325556 it took me a while to maybe win over the american crowds but i had an incredible amount of success over here masters cup houston a couple of times the us open four times in a row every other american tournament i entered i was able to win in the past

8325573 the places many of our tribal nations occupy unfortunately have long been pockets of poverty in america where the words liberty and justice for all have become empty words on a piece of paper
8325574 our tribal veterans have served in every one of this nations major wars
8325575 we recently honored the late woodrow keeble of the sisseton wahpeton oyate a hero of the korean war who received the medal of honor we never forget the sacrifices of our veterans and elders

8325578 american indians are still here and we are seeking justice for our people
8325579 i think we in the state of new jersey are setting a pattern of fiscal discipline that i think is going to have to be followed in washington
8325580 we cant afford to continue to spend and borrow and that doesnt mean that we dont have to invest in the american people and our kids and the future
8325581 we have to be a lot better at prioritizing whats important

8325586 at the moment arlene foster is running a big government department and running a by election campaign
8325587 as someone who has stood in many elections i know that arlene foster will have to spend a lot of her time campaigning in enniskillen instead of focusing all her energy on her role as enterprise minister
8325588 while she is involved in the by election she will not be fully focused on persuading foreign businesses to bring jobs and investment here with the current uncertain economic climate arlene foster should be doing all she can to bolster our economy even over the summer
8325589 this issue will spark a debate as to whether ministers should be forced to resign as councillors and
8325590 this report again shows that the executive should be doing more to increase the number of shared spaces and that they should reduce the segregation that still exists in northern ireland today
8325591 the executive have not done anything about a report that they commissioned over a year ago that showed that we waste a billion pounds a year on maintaining a divided society
8325592 this report says that one off initiatives are unlikely to have much of a long term impact as compared to those that establish ties and close friendships between the all communities this must be acted upon by the
8325593 if you know where weapons are then do something about it
8325594 i am very pleased that plans are afoot to organize homecoming parades for local armed services personnel
8325595 irrespective of peoples opinions regarding the merits of the interventions in iraq and afghanistan our troops deserve much credit for their bravery in the line of duty the whole community should be given the chance to show their appreciation for the work of local troops overseas
8325596 the newsletters campaign has been the driving force behind todays good news and i would like to praise their stance on the issue
8325597 the circumstances surrounding the removal of these protected trees has thrown up more questions than answers and i have written to the minister to ask that he clarify the circumstances surrounding the case
8325598 the trees were put under protection after an independent survey a number of months ago and yet now three of them have been removed
8325599 the schengen agreement is a fundamental part of the architecture of a modern europe it covers all members of the european union bar the united kingdom and the republic of ireland and even extends to four non
8325600 schengen effectively removes internal border controls within europe but it also strengthens common external borders security and anti terrorist information is shared across participating states so it provides both for freer internal movement and enhanced public protection

8325603 the milk cup is an international tournament that has put northern ireland on the world stage for all the right reasons but the people who threw stones at this building and who made sectarian remarks have absolutely no place at this tournament and are clearly still living in caves
8325604 for 26 years teams from around the world have come here and gone home reporting of the good experience that they have had here i hope that this team realise that those who carried out the attack are a minority that is getting smaller every day
8325605 if you know where weapons are then do something about it

8325620 this is the second serious sex attack in city centre in the past month or so this is an extremely distressing trend and the city centre should be a place where people feel totally safe my thoughts go out the woman who suffered this horrific attack
8325621 given that this attack took place in city centre in an area near many nightclubs and bars there may have been people in the vicinity who saw something which could help police catch the attacker

8325627 it should not be a matter of the police waiting for loyalists to decommission their weapons if they know where any weapons are then they should act on that information and recover them
8325628 the police have a moral obligation to take every illegal weapon off our streets to make sure that no crimes are carried out using these weapons
8325629 a significant number of residents have contacted me expressing their opposition to the signs and during the survey last night it was raised again both verbally and in writing people are particularly upset that the council erected the signs without consulting the local residents
8325630 i have also made contact today with those individuals who expressed concern about the impact which ball games on the green have on them and i am keen to explore with them if any alternative measures including some of those put forward by other residents during the survey such as low hedging or fencing would address any concerns which they may have
8325631 i wrote to the council last week and i discussed the issue with council officials today in light of the survey and pending the rospa report outcome the council is keen to try to facilitate local resolution and prevent any further escalation of this dispute
8325632 after six years of operation any new business would be reviewing its practices the same must apply to invest ni
8325633 the executive has placed great emphasis on the work of invest ni in making the economy its number one priority this can only work if invest ni is primed to deliver the success demanded by the executives own programme for government
8325634 the story so far would appear to be one of some success but also significant frustration within the business community

8325646 the doctor said the tumour was so small he wouldnt have even noticed it except for the fact that it wasnt there on previous x rays ive learned that if you catch breast cancer early the chances are overwhelmingly good that youll be cured so my attitude which very much mirrored my mothers was this wasnt a big deal
8325647 it was a pile of shit wasnt it i wanted to get a job in the can before my daughter was born it was actually very pleasant for me i didnt have much to do with sharon stone and thank god because i heard she was a fucking nightmare
8325648 my job is to not pay attention to what tom cruise did with the role in a similar way that adams is not to pay attention to what dustin did is it going to be better im not even thinking about that the film came out in 88 right i was 10 ive seen it twice in the last 20 years
8325649 i stay at 165 pounds and cook everything out of cooking light magazine i only eat irresponsibly on saturdays which means bacon and candy i am against nips and tucks if you have bad plastic surgery it looks like you were brought up poor moved to la and didnt make it if its good you just look like somebody else
8325650 crowdsourcing is the act of taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent usually an employee and outsourcing it to an undefined generally large group of people in the form of an open call
8325651 from this nationally representative telephone survey we estimate that more than 4 3 million u s adults are taking opioids regularly in any given week
8325652 the extent and characteristics of opioid use among u s adults reflected in this study reinforces the need to strike a rational balance between opioid misuse and effective control of chronic pain
8325653 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8325654 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8325655 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8325656 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
8325657 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
8325658 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
8325659 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
8325660 thousands of police will be deployed to move the protesters out of the government house
8325661 i am begging to my fellow citizens to leave the government house and hold a rally somewhere else where police will have no objection to it
8325662 i dont want to call this an ultimatum more an appeal
8325663 more people will join us tomorrow dont leave or we will lose if we hold on we will win in the next three to four days
8325664 in the end the charges against the duke athletes turned out not to be true but for nearly nine months duke lived with allegations that three student athletes might have raped a student at a nearby university duke focused on its own reputation but missed an opportunity to talk about the larger issue of rape
8325665 sexual violence is a serious matter and organizations that find themselves confronting such charges even charges they suspect may not be true need to speak clearly and strongly to the issue of rape itself
8325666 why dont you carry a stash of lollipops to hand out to cranky grownups

8325670 while down in the first half of 2008 we expect the carrier voip equipment market to bounce back in the second half ending the year on a positive note the five year outlook looks good as well as demand for voip networking gear continues unabated driven by a long term migration from circuit switched to packet telephony
8325671 similarly while the session border controller segment saw its first sequential decline this quarter due to a pause in deployments in north america and europe where large service providers are maxing out their installed base rather than purchasing new equipment we expect it to pick up nicely in the second half of the year

8325686 a lot of hard work has gone into developing and maintaining the comber greenway as an off road walking and cycling route over recent years and it is now a well used and highly valued resource for local people
8325687 the e way would undoubtedly make it quicker for people from commuter zones beyond belfast to reach the city centre however it does not pass through the main commercial and residential areas of east belfast currently served by the metro
8325688 i also raised a number of other concerns with the minister including the route proposed for the e way below the holywood arches which could potentially have a significant impact on a number of community facilities such as the library ballymacarrett recreation centre and the adjacent play park and carew family centre
8325689 the ulster unionists want to be with the tories but i cannot see why the tories would want to be with them
8325690 the uup has lost its way because it is committed to being the poor relation in a failing executive it is desperately scrabbling around to find a role for itself its representatives are trying to prove that the party is still relevant in this new political dispensation
8325691 following comments over recent weeks by iris robinson about the gay community i think it is important to show that the alliance party fully supports gay rights and the belfast pride festival
8325692 we fully support the diversity in northern ireland that the belfast pride festival celebrates
8325693 belfast pride has done a lot of excellent work in promoting gay rights and i hope they have an even better festival than last year the alliance party has supported the rights of the lesbian gay bisexual and transgender community in recent months and we will continue to do so
8325694 belfast pride will give everybody an opportunity to show solidarity with the gay community
8325695 i will be marching in the parade on saturday in belfast and i would encourage every one either gay or straight young or old to come along and show their support
8325696 the classic view which we are not disputing is that there are diminishing marginal returns to economic development
8325697 so for initial levels of economic development people are escaping subsistence poverty and peoples subjective levels of happiness will increase
8325698 happiness is the gap between what you have and what you expect to have in life if that gap is very small then you are happy and if it is quite wide then naturally you are quite unhappy
8325699 in more affluent societies people give higher priority to free choice and self expression which accordingly play an increasingly important role in shaping their wellbeing
8325700 people living in more tolerant societies tend to be happier regardless of their own beliefs
8325701 this is an incredibly neat use of google earth this is a study we would not have dreamed about doing five years ago

8325715 this is a serious situation the intruders sneaked into the indian side under the cover of fire which was most probably provided by the pakistani rangers
8325716 the gains extended a general overperformance of these measures since march despite an ongoing assumption that business investment will eventually cooperate with the recession scenario
8325717 the data are much stronger than expected for manufacturing probably showing continued strong export demand
8325718 the resilience of capital goods spending in face of tight credit conditions a poor growth outlook and declining business confidence continues to surprise
8325719 in our view relatively healthy growth abroad and the competitive value of the dollar are driving demand for u s made capital goods if correct the recent downturn in growth abroad and stabilization in the dollar could put pressure on capital goods spending in the months ahead
8325720 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point

8325749 federal revenues should have been down nearly 20 billion in the first quarter given the measures set out in last falls economic statement
8325750 instead only a 1 1 billion reduction is showing up in the national accounts
8325751 slower economic growth is a negative but right now inflation is above two per cent and were having faster nominal income growth as a consequence and that gets taxed
8325752 over the medium term the conference board expects that the federal government will be able to continue to generate fiscal surpluses
8325753 in turn this will create scope to pay down debt reduce taxes and or introduce targeted increases in spending

8325853 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for buy to let landlords as it is for other borrowers however we expect the rental market to remain underpinned by strong demand partly because some people who would like to buy a home are being forced to carry on renting for now

8325867 its important for us to understand that there are different stages of the writing process and different challenges at each stage
8325868 that the most healing way of approaching the writing process is to focus upon the potential and possibilities for growth rather than upon its problems and pitfalls
8325869 often spend far too little or far too much time at this stage some avoid it altogether and plunge right into working which can derail our process

8326024 anul trecut productia nationala de vin a fost de cinci milioane de hectolitri pentru acest an estimez o crestere de 20 datorita vremii foarte favorabile si a intrarii pe rod a noilor culturi de vita de vie in care producatorii au investit foarte mult
8326025 in acest an piata interna a vinurilor va creste cu circa 8 in valoare fata de anul trecut datorita cresterii consumului de vin si a largirii clasei medii care a inceput sa renunte treptat la consumul de vin de tara in favoarea celui cumparat imbuteliat
8326026 in acest moment vita de vie se prezinta excelent conditiile climaterice din acest an sunt favorabile nefiind nevoie de irigatii previzionand pe scurt o recolta deosebita mai mult folosirea echipamentelor de ingrijire a viei aduce cu sine o eficientizare concretizata in calitatea lucrarilor si o productivitate sporita speram sa nu ne confruntam inainte de momentul recoltarii cu surprize climaterice si sa ne putem atinge obiectivele propuse

8326051 he has had a very good club in west ham dont get me wrong but sometimes when a player comes through the ranks and they have been there since they were a young kid i think sometimes they get to a bit of a crossroads they think which road am i going to go on am i going to go to another level or just stay where i am
8326052 although the fact that they have landed west hams best defender surely reflects their ambitions
8326053 the robinho one is continuing to rumble were ever confident that will get done but i think weve always said it will go to the wire

8326074 the pfa who represent james milner are disappointed that information regarding james request for a move and the circumstances surrounding it have come to the publics attention and we feel we have no option but to respond
8326075 the facts are that james transfer request was actually handed in on wednesday august 20 at which point it was asked by newcastle united to keep the matter private
8326076 the request was given because the player was looking for an improvement on his contract that reflected his development and his value to the club there is a meeting between the owner and all relevant people at the club today wednesday when we believed james request was to be discussed
8326077 to clarify the situation james did sign a contract 12 months ago however this agreement was reached with the club nearly 12 months previous at the point in which newcastle had agreed to sell james to aston villa on transfer deadline day 2006 before canceling the agreement at the 11th hour
8326078 since then he has played over 80 games for newcastle united all james wanted was a deal that reflected his development and that was in line with newcastle uniteds transfer valuation of him

8326092 and then ill take anyone who will interview me from jobs i dont want even from jobs i know ill never want ive interviewed at mcdonalds to flip burgers it doesnt matter all im after is the experience of going through a real live interview process all the coaching in the world isnt as good a preparation as sitting down with someone and having them interview you for real
8326093 yeah youd be surprised how much you can learn by interviewing at a job you know you dont want youre not nervous youre confident and thats a big part of it learning to be calm and confident and answer their questions in the best way i can train myself to do that by going through interviews knowing that even if they want me i wont say yes its like practicing for the big game without the pressure of the bright lights or the crowd i can focus on being calm and confident and i can run through different things to find out what works and what doesnt its like practicing for the real thing by going through your paces in a live ammo situation

8326127 to have five gentlemen support me without really even knowing me and just going on one guys word was pretty mind blowing i am so thankful they came along because at that time it was really causing a lot of stress as it does when you are short of funds
8326128 i cant thank them enough they say it was nothing to them but to me it was everything
8326129 they provided me with the chance to be stress free in the build up for the olympics

8326131 how can we vote for fee increases of 5 in the college of arts given the reduction in their budgets this year
8326132 there has been a huge reduction in academic staff and the operational budget which has impacted on tutorials this does not reflect an increase in quality
8326133 just putting up fees by 500 is not making this a better university and its not making it a better research facility
8326134 if i was an arts student there is no way i would come to canterbury as a student it really scares me whats happened to the arts faculty and it could happen somewhere else
8326135 our pleas to the government for the university sector have actually been ignored comprehensively over recent years
8326136 its partly staff its partly facilities and its partly trying to improve the quality of the experience for students
8326137 it is a serious decision and we havent made it lightly
8326138 in the end in politics youve got to do whats right and im asking the new zealand public to trust us and to back us to be a government that has integrity

8326146 for some reason tiere broke loose from the group and ran the other way
8326147 the firemen found her under a table about 4 feet from a door at the end of the house
8326148 my parents were in the process of adopting tiere and her sister
8326149 no one should have to wait five years to properly grieve
8326150 i am happy i never have to see this place again
8326151 and i never have to drive past the house where she was killed
8326152 but now the focus will be on the civil suit
8326153 i come here and sit sometimes and imagine shes running around playing
8326154 all of us except for hayden roulston want to stay together as much as we can for the next four years a couple of those guys in the great britain squad are getting old now and theyre probably not going to be around forever
8326155 with another four years and a world championship under our belt we think we can get up there put it this way weve definitely got room for improvement
8326156 to come so close and not get it 6000 left me a bit disappointed id set myself a high standard and to come home with just one pb personal best out of the seven events was a little disappointing
8326157 but i went in ranked 22nd and came out 22nd so i cant complain
8326158 i finished fourth in the commonwealth in beijing and didnt even do a pb score so definitely think its possible as for london id say possibly
8326159 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for the 600 horsepower 10 cylinder car chief executive officer bob nardelli said today in a statement without elaborating

8326168 senator currie in my opinion is guilty of making a terrible mistake
8326169 knowing him i believe it was absent mindedness still he lobbied the government on behalf of a private entity for personal profit

8326175 honestly there is no answer it has just been one of those winters we have been locked into a nasty weather cycle that we cant shake
8326176 while its not common to have these weather cycles it does happen occasionally new zealand is exposed to storms from all directions and we can see some wild swings in rainfall from one year to the next
8326177 its looking more settled in spring and summer so hopefully theres light at the end of the tunnel
8326178 were under tremendous grounds pressure even in a good year so weve been particularly hard hit
8326179 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters
8326180 mr peters subsequently met me socially at the karaka yearling sales i believe in early 2006 he thanked me for my assistance
8326181 the fact that a minister is in his job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8326182 this ignores the realities of policing where an emergency could require all sworn staff to report to frontline duty at a moments notice
8326183 but we would not expect the public to be any less protected
8326184 i will find out something at the end of the week i hope in the near future anyway
8326185 but it is looking very likely that i will be going back to europe
8326186 there has been some positive talk and it is a big goal of my mine to go back
8326187 i have always wanted to go back ever since i decided to quit the big team discovery over there it is really hard to get back in there at the moment because a lot of teams are stopping it is supply and demand
8326188 there are a lot of riders on the market and very little teams
8326189 to get back over there will be very very hard but i am quite confident i can go back
8326190 i will have a rest mentally i wont be doing any training for the next two to three weeks but i will be doing something mountain biking running or the gym just to keep fit
8326191 it is all overwhelming to be honest it seems so long ago since i won the medals that everyone would have forgotten its mind blowing to see everyone here
8326192 id like to win at least four so well see what happens
8326193 its very difficult but its not out of the question we expect to pick up a whole bunch of seats
8326194 and this fall we are going to pick up more seats
8326195 were going to get this cycle over with weve got another couple of years to do before ive got to start worrying about that
8326196 and this fall we are going to pick up more seats

8326214 until those dates are out i havent really thought about any decision
8326215 im setting up a company so thats my main focus to be honest
8326216 the tour is helping to build the experience of these players and is part of a programme to build greater depth at international level
8326217 it is the best thing you will ever do in your life it just lights up my whole world when max laughs
8326218 being a mother just gives you a whole new sense of purpose and its just the most amazing thing i was in awe of the entire experience of pregnancy the entire journey was just incredible
8326219 in this business it gets crazy the people that you sort of have to weed through with bad intentions or ulterior motives but you have to trust your instincts opinion poll
8326220 i mean when people have money invested and theres 20 000 new zealanders investing in the company you expect something a little bit better than that from the chairman
8326221 its very unsatisfactory but thats been him all along hes a doer not a communicator
8326222 there is also a deferred tax adjustment of 58m which is purely ifrs international financial reporting standards nonsense and can be safely disregarded
8326223 i dont think we can overestimate his impact on new zealand business
8326224 im so excited to finally be able to bring my show to new zealand this will be my second visit but my first concert performance and i cant wait to see you all there
8326225 the grand canyon the pyramids uluru and then theres kylie
8326226 ancient spirits of evil transform this decayed form to mumm ra the ever living
8326227 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure where its heading
8326228 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8326229 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8326230 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping
8326231 you cant look at this storm and make any comparisons to katrina
8326232 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf then ill make my decisions
8326233 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8326234 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8326235 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events
8326236 we recognize there needs to be a balance between imports and domestic production in russia
8326237 we are not going to be down there with a tape measure
8326238 i still want to see the time come and go
8326239 people are very disheartened theres no doubt about it its so unnecessary
8326240 the people that pushed for it i hope theyre prepared to do some rescuing
8326241 theres goodwill and publicity obviously but it also gives people an opportunity to fly and try
8326242 if they like us and they will like us theyll fly with us again and perhaps tell their friends
8326243 to bring australians to our hub in kuala lumpur so as to feed them into our asian network and to send asian tourists to australia combining our network with airasia x
8326244 from next year australians will be able to go all the way to britain using airasia x through kuala lumpur the route will also be popular with europeans heading to australia
8326245 every day the chopper rescue crews fly to the aid of all sorts of people caught in terrible situations like car accidents accidents on farms and bush and everywhere in between
8326246 our approach has been to provide worker based architectures that expedite information gathering and administrative reporting

8326248 the best case scenario for me as a local school principal that we are bully proof fully free of any bully incidents that we are truly here with an academic focus no fighting no teasing no name calling
8326249 kids who are bullied are at greater risk of physical symptoms physical complaints emotional problems academic under achievement and most of them try to find ways to miss school
8326250 make sure youre talking to them and encouraging them to talk to you
8326251 let them know that some things just simply arent okay and they dont have to put up with it

8326422 many analysts do not expect the financial markets to improve significantly until home prices stop falling the pace of existing home sales remains low and available inventory relatively high both indicating that buyers are not yet able to step into the market at current prices

8326429 the implication of this is that real estate investors should look to get back in for long term holdings

8326437 the price appreciation in a hypothetical reit portfolio has followed the same long term trajectory as house prices have during the past fourteen years even though reits have been far more volatile from month to month and have had corrections 1997 1999 and 2002 that housing prices did not experience
8326438 apartment reits are actually positive for 2008 thats consistent with the notion that housing prices are near their lows
8326439 the implication of this is that real estate investors should look to get back in for long term holdings

8326444 the only time we issued refunds was when an advertised act did not play for some reason
8326445 it was just very sad i got tears in my eyes when he was struggling on solitary man it was a poignant song to be singing because he was indeed a solitary man
8326446 i sing myself on the side so i understand the whole thing of wanting to not let the fans down
8326447 but this was a bigger disappointment for him to have tried to do the show knowing how sick he was
8326448 i about fainted when he came out and said hello columbus because i knew something was wrong
8326449 my heart ached for him it was painful for him and me both

8326453 if it had just been me and my wife id have gotten up and left
8326454 i didnt know whether to feel sorry for the guy or appreciate that he gave it a try but he should have known that that was so far off base
8326455 if anybody was going to do it i would think that this gentleman would

8326459 there can be no underestimating the impact of wilkinsons actions his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people
8326460 here we have an armoury factory in the suburbs of berkshire creating deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17 18 19 year olds in inner city urban london
8326461 the availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets they have caused devastating shootings murders and mayhem
8326462 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system director of the department of diabetes endocrinology and metabolism at sydneys royal north shore hospital greg fulcher said in a statement
8326463 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8326464 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8326465 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication dr fulcher said
8326466 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation
8326467 so that people can wander through and see what services are available to the community and through the centre

8326475 we purchased the assets of the gallard and mirage group in october 2007 and turned these into a fully operational state of the art plant within six months

8326478 the law exists to protect the young from harm or being exposed to harm in this case both boys were made to take part in the ritual flagellation and suffered injuries to their backs
8326479 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one

8326488 that means bolstering our allies rebalancing the energy relationship with russia defending the rules of international institutions and renewing efforts to tackle unresolved conflicts
8326489 from our point of view this would be absolutely adequate response to what is happening in georgia
8326490 russia is not yet reconciled to the new map of this region
8326491 considering its actions in the falkland islands which are on the other side of the world

8326541 the change i feel is fans are really supporting me and telling me im still no 1 and still the best
8326542 the first one was definitely unexpected and a bit of shock
8326543 in 03 i think it all came a bit too soon
8326544 when we came out of the end of the year and we had won a championship i dont think we knew what wed actually achieved and now knowing what goes into it and the rewards that go to the guys and everybody who helps thats the biggest part of it
8326545 if we do win a championship it would mean a ton more than 03 i think
8326546 the drought seasons in 04 and 05 definitely make you respect things a lot more feel gifted in that you have the opportunity
8326547 so anytime you even win a race you thrive on it a little more
8326548 i think you definitely get recognized a lot more especially in indy which is where i live
8326549 theres such a history there and people love that race
8326550 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
8326551 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
8326552 i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
8326553 we just need to keep doing what weve been doing all year and well be fine
8326554 in terms of this season i think everything that hes done and weve had success together in the past is the result of all of those years of working hard day by day
8326555 its not something that just fell into place its his experience level all the things that hes managed to gather up in his data bank of experience is paying large dividends
8326556 with his ability to adapt his driving style to the racetracks that we have today in this series hes at the right place at the right time with the right team i think we were on the edge of it last year and i think his experience the whole last year was just at the point where it was starting to work well but this year scotts really been able to capitalize on that
8326557 its the same people and theyre obviously doing the same things that they were and maybe its a combination of all the small things have probably come through a little better
8326558 last year we were decent i think we just werent aggressive enough in the first part of the season and thats where we lost a lot of it and had to try and pull it back with six races to go

8326561 nosotros comparecimos contestando la demanda con una moci n diciendo que reconocemos que ellos los demandantes tienen raz n por la primera enmienda de la constituci n de estados unidos esa es la norma en el sistema federal
8326562 tenemos que estar a favor de que ellos los que hablan ingl s en puerto rico tengan papeletas en ingl s
8326563 modificar la papeleta en estos momentos ser a muy costoso y un poco tarde apoyamos que la cee imprima las instrucciones en ingl s en una hoja y en r tulos visibles y que se distribuya en todos los colegios electorales a los candidatos que participan en las elecciones generales y la p gina en internet de la cee
8326564 es razonable el gasto de unas hojas sueltas y de unos cartelones para ponerlos en cada colegio eso no es muy oneroso y se puede hacer
8326565 la constituci n federal aplica en puerto rico es un planteamiento constitucional de primera enmienda por el derecho al voto

8326579 it has nothing to do with oil literally nothing to do with oil
8326580 let me deal with the conspiracy theory idea that this is somehow to do with oil there is no way whatever if oil were the issue that it would not be infinitely simpler to cut a deal with saddam
8326581 iraqs illegal weapons programs its attempts to hide those weapons from inspectors and its links to terrorist groups
8326582 washingtons war on iraq is the lynchpin to controlling persian gulf oil
8326583 the united states remains a prisoner of its energy dilemma iraq remains a de stabilizing influence to the flow of oil to international markets from the middle east saddam hussein has also demonstrated a willingness to threaten to use the oil weapon and to use his own export program to manipulate oil markets therefore the us should conduct an immediate policy review toward iraq including military energy economic and political diplomatic assessments
8326584 the persian gulf will be a primary focus of u s international energy policy
8326585 regardless of whether we say so publicly we will go to war because saddam sits at the center of a region with more than 60 percent of all the worlds oil reserves
8326586 it stretches credulity somewhat to imagine that the subject has never been broached
8326587 could fundamentally reshape that region in a powerful positive way that will enhance u s interests
8326588 world trade is now a game in which the us produces dollars and the rest of the world produces things that dollars can buy
8326589 by definition dollar reserves must be invested in us assets creating a capital accounts surplus for the us economy even after a year of sharp correction us stock valuation is still at a 25 year high and trading at a 56 percent premium compared with emerging markets
8326590 us economys net foreign indebtedness the accumulation of two decades of running larger and larger trade deficits will reach nearly 25 percent of us gdp this year or roughly 2 5 trillion fifteen years ago it was zero before americas net balance of foreign assets turned negative in 1988 the united states was a creditor nation itself investing and lending vast capital to others always more than it borrowed now the trend line looks most alarming if the deficits persist around the current level of 400 billion a year or grow larger the total us indebtedness should reach 3 5 trillion in three years or so within a decade it would total 50 percent of gdp
8326591 that would send the already ailing dollar down even further and the initiation of a sale of our treasury securities by japan of course would immediately trigger a worldwide stampede to do the same before the securities become worth only a fraction of what they were purchased for at the same time interest rates in the u s would immediately go through the roof
8326592 we trade little pieces of paper our currency in the form of a trade deficit for asias amazing array of products and services we are smart enough to know this is a patently unfair deal unless we offer something of great value along with those little pieces of paper that product is a strong us pacific fleet which squares the transaction nicely
8326593 returns on dollar instruments are very low now other currency instruments pay more
8326594 no one is saying that the euros going to replace the dollar as the premier reserve currency
8326595 but it will increase in importance for many central banks
8326596 even if central banks increase their euro holdings by just a few percent it will have a major impact in the markets
8326597 i believe that opec will not discount entirely the possibility of adopting euro pricing and payments in the future
8326598 the demand is simple stop this war before it starts and immediately establish a sane national energy security strategy
8326599 to argue that financial markets in general and international lending in particular need to be regulated is likely to outrage the financial community yet the evidence for just that is overwhelming
8326600 30 10 02 the us state department has pushed back its planned meeting with iraqi opposition leaders on exploiting iraqs oil and gas reserves after a us military offensive removes saddam hussein from power to early december
8326601 the bush administration wants to have a working group of 12 to 20 people focused on iraqi oil and gas to be able to recommend to an interim government ways of restoring the petroleum sector following a military attack in order to increase oil exports to partially pay for a possible us military occupation government further fuelling the view that controlling iraqi oil is at the heart of the bush campaign to replace hussein with a more compliant regime
8326602 according to the source the working group will not only prepare recommendations for the rehabilitation of the iraqi petroleum sector post hussein but will address questions regarding the countrys continued membership in opec and whether it should be allowed to produce as much as possible or be limited by an opec quota and it will consider whether to honour contracts made between the hussein government and foreign oil companies including the 3
8326603 us led consortium to develop iraqi oil fields american companies will have a big shot at iraqi oil
8326604 it would devalue british north sea oil undermine american oil production and much more important it would destroy the huge profits which the united states read us oil companies stands to gain from its massive investment in caucasian oil production especially in azerbaijan
8326605 the us handled the quadrupling of oil prices in the 1970s by arranging by means of secret agreements with the saudis for the recycling of petrodollars back into the us economy the first of these deals assured a special and on going saudi stake in the health of the us dollar the second secured continuing saudi support for the pricing of all opec oil in dollars see david e spiro the hidden hand of american hegemony petrodollar recycling and international markets ithaca cornell up 1999 x 103 1a 121 these two deals assured that the us economy would not be impoverished by opec oil price hikes the heaviest burdens would be borne instead by the economies of less developed countries
8326606 we spoke at length on how to boost the role of opec
8326607 thus the brief period of stabilizing we picked up in may has given way to another major leg downward

8326615 in the end the charges against the duke athletes turned out not to be true but for nearly nine months duke lived with allegations that three student athletes might have raped a student at a nearby university duke focused on its own reputation but missed an opportunity to talk about the larger issue of rape
8326616 sexual violence is a serious matter and organizations that find themselves confronting such charges even charges they suspect may not be true need to speak clearly and strongly to the issue of rape itself
8326617 from this nationally representative telephone survey we estimate that more than 4 3 million u s adults are taking opioids regularly in any given week
8326618 the extent and characteristics of opioid use among u s adults reflected in this study reinforces the need to strike a rational balance between opioid misuse and effective control of chronic pain
8326619 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8326620 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8326621 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations

8326645 local councillors the area committee and students unions have worked very hard to provide the necessary facilities to dispose of all this waste in a considerate and tidy manner this is therefore a real blow it is really very demoralising to see the streets in this condition i have spoken to a number of local residents who tell me that students have bagged their waste sensibly and left it neatly in and around black bins only for people to come round after dark and rip the bags open causing a mess misuse of the skips often out of pure laziness has also had real knock on consequences for the state of the area

8326687 the classic view which we are not disputing is that there are diminishing marginal returns to economic development
8326688 so for initial levels of economic development people are escaping subsistence poverty and peoples subjective levels of happiness will increase
8326689 happiness is the gap between what you have and what you expect to have in life if that gap is very small then you are happy and if it is quite wide then naturally you are quite unhappy

8326709 obviously were getting lost in the hype and the hoopla in the convention talking about issues at home finally but we need to readdress the war

8326723 too often security can take a backseat to compliance thats why the aegenis group recommends that organizations deploy a web application firewall to meet pci requirement 6 6 and benefit from actual protection of vulnerabilities identified by code reviews or vulnerability scans

8326743 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and for canada as a whole
8326744 it is urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8326745 i think its absurd to suggest that you can potentially export such large quantities of water out of quebec for that not to have an environmental impact
8326746 expressed an interest in bulk water exports several years ago
8326747 by suggesting wealth generating reforms primarily on matters of taxation regulation health care and education
8326748 water clearly is a resource that is essential to life and turning it into a business may arouse fears that it could one day be overexploited
8326749 but these fears can be calmed if a legal and regulatory framework is established regardless of the fuss it is not necessary to prohibit trade in water

8326758 the reduced forcing might compensate or over compensate for the effects of the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases
8326759 it is likely that there will be a cessation of around 20 years in the increase in world temperature or possibly a decrease by 0 1 degrees or more
8326760 natural solar variability is potentially important but the climate history and physics tell us that the probability of this factor sufficiently cooling the planet to offset the enhanced greenhouse effect is distinctly remote
8326761 i have never seen a credible paper published using a climate model that shows this
8326762 i believe that we must state firmly that a cooling is possible in the near future but that the warming would then resume 10 20 years hence
8326763 it will be very hard to argue for public trust if we say nothing about the possibility and then try to argue our way out after it happens using an aussie rules analogy that would be like giving the climate sceptics a free kick 10m in front of goal

8326770 i have never seen a credible paper published using a climate model
8326771 points to recent data which indicates that global temperatures are probably rising faster than previously thought
8326772 in his recent book on human evolution for example professor stephen oppenheimer suggests that human induced warming is already counteracting a return to ice age conditions the simplistic assumption would be that if 4 deg of anthropogenic global warming coincided with 4 deg of natural cooling over say a century or so the two would simply cancel each other out though of course the story might be more complex than that

8326882 time is of the essence for doc to come up with an approval to negotiate a purchase or bid at auction you may recall that back in 2000 motukiekie island was offered for sale to doc upon expiry of their lease and doc the then minister sandra lee declined to take up that option that was an absolute catastrophe for the thousands of people that use the bay of islands every year for recreational and tourism purposes can we afford to let this opportunity go by a second time
8326883 it was a good first up but it needs solid follow up we need to get the right people from our end involved including northtec and we need to carry on the dialogue with the chinese
8326884 they understand the importance of learning and speaking english in an english speaking environment and they can combine that with sports activities they are unable to provide on their home turf
8326885 the idea is to create a school that will be different to any other school in the country it will most likely attract students from other parts of nz to learn chinese in this unique environment
8326886 we need to start small have a plan for sustained and controlled growth and keep it at a size that is appropriate for our location its hard to say if its ultimately going to grow to 100 200 or 300 students
8326887 the major focus of our discussion was targeted at assisting them to increase their own capability
8326888 the figures they were talking of in terms of increased demand for milk products were quite staggering
8326889 theyve got to come and view what we do what weve got and where we sit in the nz fishing industry before they start talking about possible future trade opportunities but the interest was definitely expressed
8326890 the incentive market in the world is huge i put the suggestion to them and they responded positively

8326899 unknowingly rack up thousands of dollars in medical bills only to discover that those expenses will not be reimbursed
8326900 if we are made aware of an instance where medical debt was incurred or someone needs to see a doctor we work on a case by case basis to resolve those issues
8326901 masshealth is keenly aware of this issue and has a shared interest with members providers and advocates to prevent disenrollments whenever possible
8326902 i think there would be a huge outcry by state government if a private insurance plan behaved that way
8326903 health care reform is working with nearly a half million people newly insured
8326904 the state budget is being strained as strong enrollment has driven up costs for health coverage
8326905 we recognize and appreciate employers role in expanding private insurance
8326906 just as many employers have stepped up in this regard and consumers are paying more for state health coverage we are asking providers health plans and businesses that have not done their fair share to do so
8326907 otherwise we are faced with imposing additional burdens on individual taxpayers or depleting our states rainy day reserves
8326908 along with cost containment initiatives shared responsibility will enable us to achieve the full promise of health care reform

8326944 this guy has been in there for over two years for a misdemeanor palacios said adding that prison time for a misdemeanor conviction is usually six months to a year at 90 50 a day that individual has cost guam taxpayers in excess of 63 000 palacios said money that could have gone to other areas to address the consent decree palacios said hes ordered staff to compile a list of detainees incarcerated for six months or more for non violent misdemeanor offenses he also will be sending a letter to the attorney generals office informing it of the issue the ags office could help alleviate the problem by choosing to prosecute the detainees or drop the cases against them he said although the team did have some recommendations palacios said he was satisfied with how the tour went you must fill out the comment body in order to submit a comment inspections the department of corrections will have to wait until october for a final report on a department of justice inspection
8326945 we look at it this way if obama does move into the white house weve got someone who understands minorities who understands issues about the territories about the islands and some of the concerns we have on guam
8326946 we think we have a really good friend in barack obama

8326982 my pa fiddy had had contact with a few of the webmasters but i was still utterly unprepared what i found during that first mammoth trawling session
8326983 i had already heard of the leaky cauldron it was one of the biggest and most popular harry potter sites on the net and i had been told about a couple of great things they had done
8326984 but i had never seen it for myself never realised exactly what went on there i sat and read editorials predictions theories that ranged from strange to wild to perfectly accurate i was frankly stunned and i remain stunned

8327125 cluxton is a very good keeper so i was just delighted to have got the shot past him
8327126 but a lot of credit must go to tommy mcguigan for the great ball across
8327127 this year i have moved about quite a bit i have played half forward in the last two games which has meant that i have played alongside brian mcguigan and brian dooher two great players
8327128 in the half forwards youre trying to match the workrate of brian dooher if you can do that youre doing well
8327129 mickey did come under a lot of pressure after we lost to down but we the squad knew ourselves that it was a minority of people it was very unfair that he did get that stick
8327130 we know mickey he just gets on with things hes very determined and that it reflected in the team itself

8327138 please accept my resignation i dont care to belong to any club that will have me as a member

8327141 so if we were to express buddhas economic ideas in modern language
8327142 the first business cycle during which median household income in america falls from peak to peak
8327143 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8327144 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8327145 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events
8327146 we recognize there needs to be a balance between imports and domestic production in russia
8327147 im really proud of him hes a great person and weve got a lot of similar experiences and it was a lot of fun to have some kinship

8327155 pacelle says that no kill must be our goal than sic he refuses to sign the u s no kill declaration wayne pacelle says that feral cats should live than sic he promotes a vision of sheltering in the asilomar accords an august 2004 meeting of animal welfare industry leaders to reduce companion animal euthanasia numbers which voted down a proposal to mandate tnr trap neuter and return claims feral cats are unhealthy and untreatable and are properly put in the same category as hopelessly ill or irremediably suffering animals and often share the same fate death
8327156 it does not make sense to keep these animals alive
8327157 hsus continues to fail miserably in terms of moving this country away from traditional reactionary adopt some and kill the rest sheltering practices despite mr pacelles facile claims to the contrary
8327158 has no idea how to lead the humane movement it is clear he cannot see the future for himself at the same time we need to send a very strong message to mr pacelle that we can see through his thinly veiled comments his insincerity on the issue his failure to truly challenge the status quo to fight for the rights of shelter animals to their very lives and to truly reform what has been a long sordid history of draconian hsus policies as it relates to dogs and cats in shelters

8327191 for a large proportion of people out there who know they have diverticulosis and have been told that they should avoid these foods there probably isn t any reason to do that
8327192 in conclusion our results suggest that nut corn and popcorn consumption is not associated with an increased risk of incident diverticulitis or diverticular bleeding and may be protective for the former
8327193 these findings refute the pervasive but unproven belief that these foods are associated with diverticular complications and suggest that the recommendation to avoid these foods in diverticular disease should be reconsidered

8327228 effective execution of agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society unlike anything the world has ever experienced a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources this shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision making at every level

8327234 in order to go to the next level and create more efficient electronics such as digital cameras we need to explore ways to make things smaller
8327235 this research shows that it is possible to create smaller ultra compact infrared optical components that can be integrated into existing semiconductor technologies while not sacrificing image quality

8327288 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
8327289 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it
8327290 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
8327291 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
8327292 the boy is being unfairly targeted because he turned down an invitation to join the defending league champion which is sponsored by an employer of one of the leagues administrators

8327296 were aware of the matter discussed tonight by the aurora police department
8327297 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now
8327298 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

8327304 it is what it is its fine no crazy dramas going on
8327305 i am left with severe scars covering most of my arms stomach and legs
8327306 this was a long and challenging process for the player and for the team
8327307 this was a good example of the problem commissioner goodell has cited with the lack of a rookie pay scale were all happy that derrick can now focus on getting on the field being a jaguar and contributing to this team
8327308 there were some unusual challenges and plenty of room for honest differences of opinion
8327309 whats happened at the very top of the first round is ridiculous
8327310 when youre paying the guys who have never done anything more than star football players in this league that have played for years and established themselves at this level what theyre capable of it can be a little frustrating
8327311 nog steeds zijn vissers de grootste menselijke veroorzakers van kabelbreuken verder brengen zeebevingen vooral in azi veel schade teweeg
8327312 wij hebben het zelf gezien kabels waar de tanden van vissen in stonden
8327313 bij jullie in ijmuiden waar de kabels aan land komen zie je met de onderwatercamera echt de prachtigste beesten
8327314 vooral nu de metaalprijzen hoog zijn een tijd geleden zocht een schip met een rov bij hongkong naar een verdwenen stuk kabel dat maar niet te vinden was verderop lag een vissersboot die de kabel had gestolen de vissers hadden 80 kilometer om de romp van het schip gewikkeld de prijs die de vissers daarvoor krijgen is een fractie van wat het kost om de kabel te repareren

8327319 i think its one of these situations where if youre going to call it an expungement it has to have all the characteristics of an expungement and frankly this law didnt get there
8327320 you cant say youre going to take it away for these purposes but not for these three purposes over there
8327321 you could have everything from a pushing shoving a minor thing that is isolated to severe beatings and you cant say that the first offender is related to the second offender not in my mind and i think thats what the statute is intended to do
8327322 thats what it seems like but it depends on how everything goes
8327323 it depends who were playing depends what is going on with the offensive line right now im hopeful but im not counting on anything
8327324 i think last year a big part of the disappointment was i felt like we didnt give everything we had from the position for the team
8327325 this year i think the opportunity is going to be there for us
8327326 what i pride myself on is being a complete tight end that involves blocking pass protecting running good routes
8327327 even when youre not catching the ball theres a lot of aspects of the game you can work on i had the opportunity to work on pass protection a lot so i consider that a positive
8327328 the bruin family lends our deepest heartfelt sympathies to the cornish family

8327388 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
8327389 in 1980 as an art student i came to have a personal relationship with christ
8327390 from a standpoint we should be grateful to joe biden
8327391 i thought well in terms of biden the 95 is just something where youve got to understand that thats sort of the worse case scenario hes cherry picking 95 was last year last night one of the things that senator clinton said that well hear a lot is john mccain wants to privatize social security we heard it from several of the other speakers last night you know thats a real exaggeration mccain is actually really vague and fuzzy on social security
8327392 this is something were all familiar with democrats expect significantly larger turnout among obamas twentysomething supporters and as a result polls that favor him will adjust their polls to include more results from voters that fit this criterion one could argue based on historical turnout of this demographic that including this data is the result of selection bias
8327393 she aced it i think shes gone farther than any losing candidate has ever gone in a convention like this
8327394 if her candidacy put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling her speech probably punched a hole in it
8327395 she did not use one adjective about obama himself nor did she reverse the skepticism shed expressed about him as commander in chief
8327396 perhaps the calculation in the clinton camp was that would have seemed inauthentic in some way and too calculated too political
8327397 the gestures the non verbals that give us the emotion really werent there
8327398 but she got over it and she was more of a professional than the other one
8327399 it took ted kennedy years to get over losing to jimmy carter it took john mccain about seven years to get over losing to george w bush hillary clinton is actually doing this at a faster pace than most primary losers
8327400 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then it s logical to implement this agreement

8327446 novelist and poet anne brookes novel maloneys law introduces us to paul maloney a small time private investigator from london against his better judgement he takes on a case from big time businessman dominic allen for maloney the case is fraught with physical and emotional risks dominic is his ex lover and the ex part of the equation is still the source of great pain for maloney with her use of a gay pi brooke is able to step outside the hard bitten clich s of the genre and explore an emotional landscape denied to many other crime writers when maloney is upset he cries yet when he needs information vital to his new case he breaks into a secure building and fights his way out dodging bullets as he goes the complexity of her main character is one of the great strengths of the novel the reader feels his peril and his emotional turmoil when he discovers just how ruthless his ex lover can be brooke adheres to one of the best traditions of the genre in the tightness and internal consistency of her plot the details of the investigation weave an ever more intriguing spell around the reader her descriptions of the gruesome reprisals inflicted on maloney after he discovers too much are carried off with compelling realism his immersion in the soho clubbing scene is also done with unflinching honesty with writing credits that range across crime fiction psychological thrillers romantic comedy fantasy and poetry one can only wonder where anne brookes eclectic interests will take her next on the evidence of maloneys law it will be a fascinating destination

8327577 ive had more contact from the mccain campaign since the nomination than from the obama campaign
8327578 she was fabulous nothing less than i expected its hard to sit here and think about she would have accomplished were not stupid were not going to vote for john mccain
8327579 it will take a congress as well as a president thats what i can do and be true to who i am
8327580 i hate obama so much that im going to devote as much time to mccain as i did to hillary
8327581 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8327582 we really are taking a position of being indifferent to obama
8327583 to be honest that would make this whole thing a lot easier
8327584 four years ago if you said wed be at a hillary happy hour at the dnc i would have called you crazy but today is a great opportunity for people who agree that sen barack obama doesnt have the experience to be president of the united states
8327585 the dnc really pushed barack obama on us now theyve left us with two choices somebody who has no substance or a republican
8327586 and these are terrible choices and they worked hard to select this candidate were watching the dnc pick this candidate for us

8327599 ciertamente dir a yehowah t eres mi refugio y mi plaza fuerte mi dios en quien de veras confiar
8327600 porque tanto am dios al mundo que dio a su hijo unig nito para que todo el que ejerce fe en l no sea destruido sino que tenga vida eterna
8327601 los justos mismos poseer n la tierra y residir n para siempre sobre ella
8327602 tienes que amar a yehowah tu dios con todo tu coraz n y con toda tu alma y con toda tu mente
8327603 esto es lo que el amor de dios significa que observemos sus mandamientos y sin embargo sus mandamientos no son gravosos
8327604 esto es lo que ha dicho yehowah tu recomprador el santo de israel
8327605 y en el momento en que entraba en cierta aldea lo encontraron diez varones leprosos pero se pusieron de pie a lo lejos
8327606 hijo m o si recibes mis dichos y atesoras contigo mis propios mandamientos de modo que con tu o do prestes atenci n a la sabidur a para que inclines tu coraz n al discernimiento si adem s clamas por el entendimiento mismo y das tu voz por el discernimiento mismo si sigues buscando esto como a la plata y como a tesoros escondidos sigues en busca de ello en tal caso entender s el temor de yehowah y hallar s el mism simo conocimiento de dios
8327607 no nos ard a el coraz n cuando l ven a habl ndonos por el camino cuando nos estaba abriendo por completo el sentido de las escrituras
8327608 esto significa vida eterna el que est n adquiriendo conocimiento de ti el nico dios verdadero y de aquel a quien t enviaste jesucristo
8327609 qu me ense a esto acerca de yehowah me da alguna raz n m s para amarlo con todo el coraz n mente y alma
8327610 reflexiona sobre estas cosas h llate intensamente ocupado en ellas para que tu adelantamiento sea manifiesto a todos
8327611 conf a en l a todo tiempo oh pueblo delante de l derramen ustedes su coraz n dios es refugio para nosotros
8327612 de concedernos despu s de haber sido librados de la mano de nuestros enemigos el privilegio de rendirle servicio sagrado sin temor
8327613 y estas buenas nuevas del reino se predicar n en toda la tierra habitada para testimonio a todas las naciones y entonces vendr el fin
8327614 vayan por lo tanto y hagan disc pulos de gente de todas las naciones bautiz ndolos en el nombre del padre y del hijo y del esp ritu santo ense ndoles a observar todas las cosas que yo les he mandado y miren estoy con ustedes todos los d as hasta la conclusi n del sistema de cosas
8327615 sin embargo tenemos este tesoro en vasos de barro para que el poder que es m s all de lo normal sea de dios y no el que procede de nosotros
8327616 porque dios no es injusto para olvidar la obra de ustedes y el amor que mostraron para con su nombre por el hecho de que han servido a los santos y contin an sirviendo
8327617 por consiguiente amados hermanos m os h ganse constantes inmovibles siempre teniendo mucho que hacer en la obra del se or sabiendo que su labor no es en vano en lo relacionado con el se or
8327618 el gran d a de yehowah est cerca est cerca y hay un apresurarse much simo de l
8327619 porque la visi n es todav a para el tiempo se alado y sigue jadeando hasta el fin y no dir mentira aun si tardara mant nte en expectaci n de ella porque sin falta se realizar no llegar tarde
8327620 consideremos c mo estimularnos unos a otros al amor y a las buenas obras no dejemos de reunirnos como acostumbran algunos sino anim monos unos a otros y mucho m s al ver que el d a se acerca
8327621 contin en soport ndose unos a otros y perdon ndose liberalmente unos a otros si alguno tiene causa de queja contra otro como yehowah los perdon liberalmente a ustedes as tambi n h ganlo ustedes
8327622 pelea la excelente pelea de la fe logra asirte firmemente de la vida eterna para la cual fuiste llamado y presentaste la excelente declaraci n p blica enfrente de muchos testigos
8327623 mas no es con el don como fue con la ofensa porque si por la ofensa de un solo hombre muchos murieron mucho m s abundaron para los muchos la bondad inmerecida de dios y su d diva gratuita con la bondad inmerecida por el solo hombre jesucristo
8327624 estoy adorando a dios como l manda en la biblia
8327625 en esto todos conocer n que ustedes son mis disc pulos si tienen amor entre s
8327626 vayan y hagan disc pulos de gente de todas las naciones bautiz ndolos
8327627 despu s que jes s fue bautizado inmediatamente sali del agua y mire los cielos se abrieron y l vio descender como paloma el esp ritu de dios que ven a sobre
8327628 en vista de eso dije aqu he venido en el rollo del libro est escrito de m
8327629 por eso nosotros tambi n desde el d a en que lo o mos no hemos cesado de orar por ustedes y de pedir que se les llene del conocimiento exacto de su voluntad en toda sabidur a y comprensi n espiritual
8327630 y consider monos unos a otros para incitarnos al amor y a las obras excelentes sin abandonar el reunirnos como algunos tienen por costumbre sino anim ndonos unos a otros y tanto m s al contemplar ustedes que el d a se acerca
8327631 felipe corri al lado y le oy leer en voz alta a isa as el profeta y dijo verdaderamente sabes lo que est s leyendo l dijo realmente c mo podr a hacerlo a menos que alguien me guiara y suplic a felipe que subiera y se sentara con l
8327632 todo lo ha hecho bello a su tiempo aun el tiempo indefinido ha puesto en el coraz n de ellos para que la humanidad nunca descubra la obra que el dios verdadero ha hecho desde el comienzo hasta el fin
8327633 porque en realidad aunque deber an ser maestros en vista del tiempo de nuevo necesitan que alguien les ense e desde el principio las cosas elementales de las sagradas declaraciones formales de dios y han llegado a ser como quienes necesitan leche no alimento s lido
8327634 adem s sin fe es imposible ser le de buen agrado porque el que se acerca a dios tiene que creer que l existe y que llega a ser remunerador de los que le buscan sol citamente
8327635 ahora miren hoy me voy por el camino de toda la tierra y ustedes bien saben con todo su coraz n y con toda su alma que ni una sola palabra de todas las buenas palabras que yehowah su dios les ha hablado ha fallado todas se han realizado para ustedes ni una sola palabra de ellas ha fallado
8327636 adem s no hay salvaci n en ning n otro porque no hay otro nombre debajo del cielo que se haya dado entre los hombres mediante el cual tengamos que ser salvos
8327637 toda escritura es inspirada de dios y provechosa para ense ar para censurar para rectificar las cosas para disciplinar en justicia para que el hombre de dios sea enteramente competente y est completamente equipado para toda buena obra
8327638 y dije no voy a hacer menci n de l y no hablar m s en su nombre
8327639 ahora bien porque tenemos el mismo esp ritu de fe como aquel del cual est escrito
8327640 presten atenci n a s mismos y a todo el reba o entre el cual el esp ritu santo los ha nombrado superintendentes para pastorear la congregaci n de dios que l compr con la sangre del hijo suyo
8327641 pastoreen el reba o de dios bajo su custodia no como obligados sino de buena gana tampoco por amor a ganancia falta de honradez sino con empe o tampoco como ense ore ndose de los que son la herencia de dios sino haci ndose ejemplos del reba o
8327642 qu no saben que los injustos no heredar n el reino de dios no se extrav en ni fornicadores ni id latras ni ad lteros ni hombres que se tienen para prop sitos contranaturales ni hombres que se acuestan con hombres ni ladrones ni personas dominadas por la avidez ni borrachos ni injuriadores ni los que practican extorsi n heredar n el reino de dios
8327643 ahora bien las obras de la carne son manifiestas y son fornicaci n inmundicia conducta relajada idolatr a pr ctica de espiritismo enemistades contiendas celos arrebatos de c lera altercaciones divisiones sectas envidias borracheras diversiones estrepitosas y cosas semejantes a estas en cuanto a estas cosas les aviso de antemano de la misma manera como ya les avis que los que practican tales cosas no heredar n el reino de dios
8327644 arrepi ntanse y vu lvanse para que sean borrados sus pecados
8327645 porque todos han pecado y no alcanzan a la gloria de dios
8327646 por eso as como por medio de un solo hombre el pecado entr en el mundo y la muerte mediante el pecado y as la muerte se extendi a todos los hombres porque todos hab an pecado
8327647 porque yehowah tu dios que se halla en medio de ti es un dios que exige devoci n exclusiva por temor de que la c lera de yehowah tu dios se encienda contra ti y l tenga que aniquilarte de sobre la superficie del suelo
8327648 entonces llam a s a la muchedumbre con sus disc pulos y les dijo
8327649 con el fin de vivir el resto de su tiempo en la carne ya no para los deseos de los hombres sino para la voluntad de dios
8327650 siempre que hagas un voto a dios no titubees en pagarlo porque no hay deleite en los est pidos lo que prometes en voto p galo
8327651 de una manera digna de yehowah a fin de agradarle plenamente
8327652 esto es lo que el amor de dios significa que observemos sus mandamientos y sin embargo sus mandamientos no son gravosos
8327653 pues l mismo conoce bien la formaci n de nosotros y se acuerda de que somos polvo
8327654 no tengas miedo porque estoy contigo no mires por todos lados porque soy tu dios yo ciertamente te fortificar yo cierta y verdaderamente te ayudar s yo verdaderamente te mantendr firmemente asido con mi diestra de justicia
8327655 conf a en yehowah con todo tu coraz n y no te apoyes en tu propio entendimiento 6 en todos tus caminos t malo en cuenta y l mismo har derechas tus sendas
8327656 porque con el coraz n se ejerce fe para justicia pero con la boca se presenta declaraci n p blica para salvaci n
8327657 en el nombre del padre y del hijo y del esp ritu santo
8327658 para que la gente sepa que t cuyo nombre es yehowah t solo eres el alt simo sobre toda la tierra
8327659 por otra parte el fruto del esp ritu es amor gozo paz gran paciencia benignidad bondad fe 23 apacibilidad autodominio contra tales cosas no hay ley
8327660 porque la profec a no fue tra da en ning n tiempo por la voluntad del hombre sino que hombres hablaron de parte de dios al ser llevados por esp ritu santo
8327661 la intimidad con yehowah pertenece a los que le temen tambi n su pacto para hacer que lo conozcan
8327662 sigan obrando su propia salvaci n con temor y temblor
8327663 en el nombre del padre y del hijo y del esp ritu santo

8327737 in the majority of people that opportunity is tragically missed because the ego identifies with the return movement getting healthier fighting back resilience just as it identified with outward movement successful careers active social life accruing a big bank account this results in a hardening of the egoic shell a contraction rather than an opening the diminished ego then spends the rest of its days whining or complaining trapped in fear or anger self pity guilt blame or other negative mental emotional states or avoidance strategies becoming dependent on morhpine such as attachment to memories or thinking and talking about the past when the ego is no longer identified with these things old age or approaching death becomes what it is meant to be an opening into the realm of spirit

8327805 hence the bulk of the galaxy is comprised of dark matter these are the most dark matter dominated galaxies in the known universe

8327851 the eastern portion of the fault has moved at a predictable rate and the earthquake activity associated with it has been what we would expect
8327852 but the western part of the fault has been lagging in terms of the number and size of earthquakes it seems to be straining absorbing the motion
8327853 it could mean that the fault is getting ready for a large earthquake or it could mean that the movement has been so gradual that we couldnt detect it
8327854 land stations also detected a four fold increase in the number of earthquakes along the blanco fault in 2008 compared to background rates
8327855 our monitoring may be missing a lot of earthquakes that are less than 3 0
8327856 the western side of the fault may be experiencing a series of mini quakes that we cant detect or it could be slowing creeping along in a way we cannot measure
8327857 but we cant discount the possibility that its energy hasnt been released and it will some day in the form of a good sized earthquake
8327858 you need quite a bit of vertical displacement on the ocean floor to generate a tsunami
8327859 between the land based network the hydrophones and other instruments the threshold of detection for earthquakes has definitely lowered over the past 20 years
8327860 but we still cant tell whether the western part of the fault has thousands or even millions of infinitesimal slips or it is building up to a major earthquake
8327861 todays revised proposal is a blueprint for extinction not recovery
8327862 this plan would eliminate connectivity between ewe groups and strip protections in habitat essential for recovery including many areas of essential alluvial fan and canyon bottom habitat

8327870 it is time to change the quota regime and reduce imports which have unfortunately built up in recent years
8327871 agreements signed more than three years ago as part of the negotiations on wto accession are unfortunately no longer in russias interests
8327872 but the fact that it has been mentioned now is almost certainly linked with the rhetoric that weve had from georgia and from prime minister vladimir putin it has just been accelerated as a result of current events
8327873 this lawsuit is a poorly disguised attempt to deflect attention away from the primary cause of the decline of the sacramento san joaquin delta estuary
8327874 the truth is that the massive increase in the diversion of water in recent years has accelerated the crash of the delta fisheries although many factors such as pollution urban development and invasive species affect the delta excessive water diversion is the leading cause of the decline in the fisheries
8327875 delta smelt salmon and striped bass have successfully co existed in this ecosystem for more than a century there is no evidence that recent population declines of either delta smelt or chinook salmon resulted from predation by striped bass whose numbers have also collapsed
8327876 in contrast there is strong scientific evidence that dams water diversions pollution and the collapse of the planktonic food web in the upper estuary are harming all the fishes that rely on the bay delta
8327877 delta smelt and chinook salmon have shown continuous long term declines since the 1960s and 1970s when the state and federal water projects began exporting water and striped bass have shown the same decline
8327878 there has been no evidence of a classic predator prey relationship no reputable scientist has pinned the crash of smelt and salmon on the striped bass
8327879 although they claim to care about the ecological health of the delta the so called coalition for a sustainable delta is most interested in maintaining their historic allotment of taxpayer subsidized water exports their efforts to blame striped bass are ridiculous and a desperate move
8327880 we hope they will focus their attention on the real issues affecting the health of the delta compared to the alleged striped bass predation issue there are hundreds of more important issues affecting salmon and smelt in this once great estuary
8327881 im certain the endangered species act was never designed to decimate an important recreational asset like the west coast striped bass fishery and remove its status as a sport fish
8327882 yet thats exactly what will happen if the irrigators prevail in this lawsuit
8327883 i hate to think of all the tackle shop owners marinas and fishing guides that will be unnecessarily harmed if the coalition for a sustainable delta wins this suit
8327884 blaming striped bass for the decline of endangered bay delta fisheries is yet another devious plot of the water grabbers who comprise the coalition for a sustainable delta it is obvious the coalition considers the striped bass to be a roadblock for claiming more northern water
8327885 they should put their efforts toward addressing the real problems that have adversely affected delta smelt and chinook salmon if the coalition is successful in their greedy attack it will signal the end of a great fishery for many individuals and families and for many young and old anglers who love the thrill of catching a striped bass

8327890 i used to get angry when this happened now i just get depressed
8327891 i think last year i was a little more angry now im just rolling with the punches
8327892 i guess if 10 years ago somebody told me id be in nascar part time or anything i would have told them they were crazy
8327893 i feel proud of the kind of unique career ive carved out in motorsports i just love being part of the sport
8327894 i was driving back in a box truck from florida and stopped about 2 in the morning at a car dealership
8327895 i hooked up the hose in the back and was showering and all of a sudden a cop pulled up and told me i couldnt stay there i just drove next door and it just happened to be tom milners building i didnt even know it until he woke me up in the morning
8327896 he was almost like a father to me when i was struggling in racing he kept me employed
8327897 all my life people have told me it cant be done but im a firm believer that if you work hard enough it can be done ive proved it
8327898 given the opportunity with a full time sponsor we could compete with these guys weve shown we can do it every time we race
8327899 i think he brings a lot of entertainment to the series wed love to see him out there all the different types of cars that hes driven and hes had success in proves what kind of race car driver he is
8327900 hes all about giving and just a huge asset to our sport
8327901 his personality is second to none larger than life id love to see him full time and i think if he ever got the right chance with the right people he could make it work
8327902 frightened i see guys like jeff gordon and dale earnhardt jr and in all their fan clubs there are cute little girls yelling their name
8327903 me ive got a bunch of 35 year old guys and gals wearing wigs yelling my name
8327904 but after i met them and started thinking about it if i wasnt racing id probably be one of those guys
8327905 people dont realize how many types of algae there are from single cells to large kelp and each one develops differently
8327906 what were trying to do is choose the best of the best the ones that produce the right lipids for a particular type of fuel

8327910 some weekends i feel like we have a dominant car and other weekends i feel like were a fifth place car or even a 10th place car
8327911 with the strong team we have we seem to be able to rally back and get finishes out of it so i still think that we are maybe behind
8327912 in different weeks the 88 car earnhardt has been the car the 24 gordon was the car early we were and its just tough to really say where were at
8327913 its been tough for him and its been a huge huge challenge for him
8327914 but more importantly the go to moves that weve always had with the old car do not work with the cot and to kind of retrain chads brain and look at things in a different way that is the hardest part for him
8327915 the latest greatest moves and the stuff we thought was going to work based on the old car and we were not even in the same race
8327916 we were out there in a seven cylinder class it seemed like that has been the hardest part to find out where to work and thats what weve done all season long
8327917 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past doesnt work with this new car
8327918 we are trying to find the right direction in the right areas to turn him loose and let him work
8327919 its a lot of small areas and we are now i feel getting the rhythm of this car and understanding what to work on
8327920 as the chase gets closer everybody that has a shot at this thing is going to find ways to motivate themselves and areas they can potentially play mind games in or be out on the track and try to intimidate someone

8327933 and the viewers get to decide which songs actually end up in the final list
8327934 we have not found willing partners on the other side of the table
8327935 our efforts are to first evacuate the civilians and then go for the final action
8327936 we are exercising maximum restraint to ensure the civilians are safe we have every apprehension that the terrorists may harm the civilians

8327954 der tv ger te markt in deutschland hat in den vergangenen zwei jahren einen umbruch erlebt der starke preisverfall bei flachbildfernsehern bezieht sich zum gro teil auf lcd ger te da viele kunden alte r hrenfernseher auf die neue technologie umgestellt haben
8327955 r hrenger te sind heute zum gr ten teil bereits aus dem handel verschwunden wollen kunden ein neuger t kaufen greifen diese schlie lich kaum mehr auf r hrenfernseher zur ck

8327957 some people who grew up in high altitude areas think the dip in collapsed cakes was designed as a reservoir for frosting
8327958 we could see a serious strengthening of nato actually performing its core mission of standing against the russians and trying to roll back russian influence in the former cis thats going to be the main issue
8327959 the worst scenario for the russian ruling elite is the introduction of western principles of responsible government fair elections and rule of law and so on which will actually undermine the position of our corrupt elite and they dont want that
8327960 they were very much frightened by the so called colored revolutions democratic revolutions in georgia and in ukraine in 03 and 04
8327961 and that is well understood here russia so there is more talk aimed at western public opinion to frighten people who would agree ok we can give away georgia we dont know nothing much about georgia its far off let the russians have georgia if that can help avoid a world war so i believe this is basically propaganda aimed at western public opinion
8327962 here rests in honored glory an american soldier known but to god
8327963 the overall appearance of the memorial is not what it should be and we know this is a problem
8327964 a replica is not the same thing as the original
8327965 the cracks continue to grow and i cant predict what the weather is going to continue to do to the monument
8327966 cemetery officials heard our concerns and were not very receptive to changing their plans
8327967 if they were to replace the monument with the same marble material it would eventually start cracking again
8327968 for now we will intermittently repair the monument with grouting process that should hold for several years at a time
8327969 cracks cannot be repaired indefinitely without the monument acquiring a patched worn and shabby appearance which is the antithesis of its purpose and contrary to arlington national cemeterys mission of maintaining a dignified fitting memorial to our countrys fallen soldiers
8327970 i worry that as the cracks worsen it will eventually take away from the visitors experience

8327975 raleys might have very high customer satisfaction but people still might not come back because theyre hedging against financial risk
8327976 the customer keeps hearing wal mart has the lowest prices and then theyll go try em once or twice
8327977 and if theyre willing to put up with that shopping experience then theyll become a loyal wal mart shopper
8327978 theyve tried a lot of different things which suggests to me that the things they have tried havent shown startlingly good results
8327979 theyre saying were not really going to go after the wal mart customers
8327980 we were going through a couple of ideas and we were just not where we wanted to be in terms of being disruptive

8327996 my understanding is that the locketts and the popers were friends they did huge housing developments in east long beach in the 50s
8327997 most of it came from richard poper and his wife phyllis

8328140 most religious buildings today are intended for congregational worship where groups of people get together on a regular basis to celebrate their god and receive spiritual comfort ancient greek temples were rarely used this way they were meant to serve as homes for the individual god or goddess who protected and sustained the community the god or goddess was represented by a cult image
8328141 misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church on abortion
8328142 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8328143 while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8328144 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with the respect for the fundamental right to life
8328145 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8328146 this isnt about abortion on demand its about careful careful consideration of all factors that a woman has to make with her doctor and her god
8328147 and so i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins as i say the catholic church for centuries has been discussing this
8328148 the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops
8328149 from the beginning the catholic church has respected the dignity of all human life from the first moment of conception to natural death
8328150 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
8328151 in the absence of modern medical knowledge some of the early fathers held that abortion was homicide others that it was tantamount to homicide and various scholars theorized about when and how the unborn child might be animated or ensouled
8328152 but none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8328153 the duty of the church and other religious communities is moral witness the duty of the state and its officials is to serve the common good which is always rooted in moral truth a proper understanding of the separation of church and state does not imply a separation of faith from political life but of course its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
8328154 no one with the slightest measure of integrity or honor could fail to know what these marvelous beings manifestly clearly and obviously are as they smile and wave into the world outside the womb
8328155 in simplest terms they are human beings with an inalienable right to live a right that the speaker of the house of representatives is bound to defend at all costs for the most basic of ethical reasons they are not parts of their mothers and what they are depends not at all upon the opinions of theologians of any kind
8328156 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8328157 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion

8328182 the classic view which we are not disputing is that there are diminishing marginal returns to economic development
8328183 so for initial levels of economic development people are escaping subsistence poverty and peoples subjective levels of happiness will increase
8328184 happiness is the gap between what you have and what you expect to have in life if that gap is very small then you are happy and if it is quite wide then naturally you are quite unhappy
8328185 in more affluent societies people give higher priority to free choice and self expression which accordingly play an increasingly important role in shaping their wellbeing
8328186 people living in more tolerant societies tend to be happier regardless of their own beliefs

8328238 de archeologische wereld gniffelde vandaag liggen de bewijzen op tafel
8328239 nog in maart dit jaar onmiddellijk nadat de cordier in knack zijn labyrinttheorie had uiteengezet vroegen jonge archeologen op archeo net sic smalend sic of dit blad zich een vervroegde 1 aprilgrap had gepermitteerd
8328240 de resultaten van de grap staan nu in al hun naakte wetenschappelijke feitelijkheid op papier
8328241 het onderzoek van de mataha expeditie bevestigt de aanwezigheid van archeologische elementen in de labyrintzone ten zuiden van de piramide van amenemhet iii deze elementen beslaan een ondergrondse zone van verschillende hectaren en hebben de prominente vorm van verticale muren de muren met gemiddelde dikte van verschillende meters zijn verbonden om nagenoeg gesloten ruimten te vormen die als hoog in aantal ge nterpreteerd worden
8328242 de redactie kon massas fotos krijgen maar geen enkele van onder de grond nochtans stuurt een georadar vanuit de diepte meteen 3d beelden door
8328243 de gegevens van de eerste scanning niet haarscherp zichtbaar zouden zijn
8328244 zodat ook de laatste scepticus over de brug gehaald kan worden
8328245 archeologen zijn mensen die vooral in materi le gegevens geloven meer dan in virtuele
8328246 dat is beter dan wachten tot de hele oppervlakte blootgelegd is
8328247 een archeologische vondst is het zeer zeker niet collegas hebben er al gegraven en niets gevonden dit is een kunstproject het geofysisch onderzoek wees uit dat er iets in de grond zit maar het kan evengoed een grafveld zijn
8328248 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days

8328251 they the marines are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8328252 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be

8328385 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute was the correct one
8328386 we are providing the tools for users to connect and share information with their hi5 network from almost anywhere in the world in addition as we see the number of users accessing hi5 via their mobile phones increase it will open up the opportunity to roll out hyper localized advertising

8328388 sometimes he used a trolley to wheel goods out of the store
8328389 unfortunately he fell in with people who used drugs and he then declined into heroin use
8328390 he was quickly fired when his employer caught him stealing from pub tills
8328391 he then lapsed into crime to get money for drugs
8328392 i suppose its is a case of being bold walking out carrying something large rather than sneaking around with something hidden in your pocket

8328396 we dont think the credit cycle has bottomed out yet
8328397 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
8328398 if you go for an overly prescriptive regime then that might leave a whole set of circumstances that you might not contemplate being caught or not caught so this has quite a wide ranging application
8328399 giving a glass of wine at the table with the family with a meal to a child who is 17 and they have one glass served by a sober parent then clearly you would say that is not irresponsible supply
8328400 i expect that this will have a number of effects one is that parents are looking forward to having this in their armoury of debates they have with their kids and being able to point out this is what the law says
8328401 secondly it will mean that there is no question about the fact that loading up 17 year old kids with a weeks supply of alcohol and saying good luck is out of the question

8328411 these are the earliest copies of the bible ever found
8328412 the bible is sacred to us and to you and to all the monotheistic religions and therefore the scrolls are national treasures and world treasures and therefore it is our duty to preserve them at least for 2 000 years more
8328413 they show the connection between christianity judaism and how everything evolved from the god the god is one god
8328414 just by applying the latest infrared technologies and shooting at very high detail lots of resolution we are already opening up new characters from the scrolls that are either extremely indistinct or you just couldnt see them before
8328415 to switch over to digital is really the way to go and people were resistant to it initially because it was a new way of doing stuff

8328426 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8328427 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8328428 in future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain
8328429 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8328430 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now
8328431 i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club i think i show that in the way i play every week i also have far too much respect for the people of manchester and england to criticise them in this way
8328432 its not only the weather that im not happy about here
8328433 in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8328434 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8328435 i will tell you that we are very keen to try and strengthen our side between now and transfer deadline day
8328436 i am sure i could get one or two in anyway but it is just adding the sort of quality that i would want and that is exactly what i will be trying to do
8328437 am i a fan of milner he was nearly here two years ago he nearly signed two years ago but it didnt materialise but i never think anything is done and dusted until anything happens
8328438 so many things have happened to me as a player and as a manager that i would never take anything for granted it was disappointing at the time but it was two years ago
8328439 if gareth stays with us for the foreseeable future i will be really delighted
8328440 i would have said only a few weeks ago i was resigned myself to the fact he would no longer be here around about the time we played reading in a friendly and when he didnt come with us to malaga
8328441 if he does stay i will be delighted it will be a really big bonus for us
8328442 i think gareth has played four games in quick succession with the one for england four in 12 days after a stop start pre season which hasnt helped him
8328443 he will have better days for us than on saturday at stoke with a bit of luck but saturday might just have been a culmination of the four games in quick succession the lack of any steady pre season and all of those things
8328444 i couldnt have faulted him in any of the matches he had played for us before that
8328445 this is an excellent start to the year for the nhs
8328446 a strong financial position backed by good progress on delivery will continue to ensure high quality services for patients
8328447 this forecast surplus begs the question whether taxpayers money is being used effectively
8328448 what evidence is there that trusts are using their surpluses to prepare for fluctuations in demand and investment in new services is this the nhs preparing for a period of slower growth in funding or is this individual trusts building up a surplus so that they can survive in a more competitive environment
8328449 several reports have shown that the current funding system risks damaging quality in the nhs but has done nothing to improve efficiency
8328450 ministers should focus on sorting this out rather than patting themselves on the back for allowing the nhs to bank more and more cash
8328451 there continue to be hospitals whose finances are far from stable as we can see from the number of primary care trusts who are rationing access to medicines

8328464 zero day threat the shocking truth of how banks and credit bureaus help cyber crooks steal your money and identity is an interesting and eye opening look at how banks and credit card companies make id theft and fraud rather elementary but with all that this book must be read in the larger context of how todays society deals with and is often oblivious to risk when is comes to risk american society tolerates tens of thousands of drunk driving deaths gives millions in federal tobacco subsidies and is oblivious about near epidemics such as heart disease obesity and diabetes with all that it is doubtful that the myriad horror stories zero day threat details will persuade congress or the other players to do anything to curtail the problem with identity theft and internet fraud
8328465 while terminal chaos should be shelved in the current events or business section of a bookstore it could also be placed in the modern crime section after reading it one gets the impression that the state of air traffic today could only come due to criminal neglect or mischief if one looks at pictures of airline flights from the 1960s you will see well dressed passengers enjoying their flight in 2008 barely a day goes by without an incident of air rage from irate passengers in the terminal to those in the air causing flights to be diverted todays airline traveler considers it a near miracle if his flight arrives on time with his baggage
8328466 american society tolerates tens of thousands of drunk driving deaths
8328467 and is oblivious about near epidemics such as heart disease obesity and diabetes

8328476 mccain voted with bush 95 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8328477 in four months we will actually have an administration that believes in science
8328478 if mccain s the answer then the question must be ridiculous

8328501 i saw that i was going to win and i celebrated because i worked hard all year and i got what i wanted
8328502 i think that usains dominance in the 100 meters brings a lot of jealousy because normally you have one country that usually dominates this event

8328508 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8328509 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8328510 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8328511 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8328512 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8328513 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing

8328516 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8328517 we need to make sure our prevention messages are comprehensive

8328519 one of the best ways to find college students is on facebook since thats where they meet and interact with each other
8328520 we found that two thirds of our participants were recruited online either through facebook or through e mail

8328522 and that may partially contribute to the higher testing observed among black students in the study

8328642 no im not done when the fact is that im about as down the middle as anybody on television on any network and you come in with a cheap shot calling up your party
8328643 you didnt show up three times in a row three times you slept through your alarm and didnt come on this show
8328644 we do have a lot of question marks like a lot of teams in our league
8328645 our league is one of those leagues you just dont know for sure whos going to be what until you get in the middle of it
8328646 theres going to be a lot of good teams but theres not a team returning a group where you say theyre the clear cut favorite to win the league
8328647 youve got some quality underclassmen on these teams that are coming back

8328679 there have been instances where iraqis have gotten themselves in a life threatening situation because they could not read the warning signs so we are potentially saving lives
8328680 they dont have a proper hospital where they can go to be treated
8328681 the clinic they do have is lacking medical supplies such as glasses and the facilities to treat some of the more severe eyesight problems
8328682 the local optometrist will be handing out most of the glasses for free
8328683 its great that there are people back in the states that are willing to help the people out here
8328684 by helping the people they are also helping our mission to aid the iraqis in rebuilding their infrastructure

8328708 what an opportunity to see what was going on in the industry
8328709 everything has to be spot on it is really like an orchestra
8328710 well know more after this weekend and more again in another month where we are at
8328711 rutgers is committed to a successful and accountable intercollegiate athletics program
8328712 rutgers saved more than 700 000 from reduced expenses associated with the transition of the six varsity sports to club status even after increasing womens athletics scholarships
8328713 arguments that are getting shopworn and more outdated and distant from the people who love this university
8328714 reallocate scholarships from men to women to meet those title ix requirements
8328715 there will be no additional 700 000 there will be no additional 200 000
8328716 a n institution does not need to spend additional money in order to comply with title ix under these circumstances
8328717 the university increased womens athletic scholarships by more than 600 000 from the 2006 07 to 2007 08 academic year
8328718 24 intercollegiate sports far more than most of its peer institutions
8328719 with more than 50 recreation and club sports rutgers provides an opportunity for participation to thousands of students
8328720 t here are more fencers in the program since its transition from a varsity team to a club sport
8328721 rutgers is gaining an athletics reputation to match its academic accomplishments
8328722 an athletics reputation to match its academic accomplishments for the eliminated teams and terminated student athletes that reputation already existed indeed by axing the scarlet six rutgers damaged its reputation
8328723 president mccormick and his leadership team are reinforcing the principles of accountability and integrity in all business transactions throughout the university
8328724 rutgers gave coach schiano a secret guarantee schianos escape clause is latest ru revelation
8328725 the 2 million coach says hes focused schiano says its football not details about pay and perks thats important
8328726 until those dates are out i havent really thought about any decision
8328727 im setting up a company so thats my main focus to be honest
8328728 the tour is helping to build the experience of these players and is part of a programme to build greater depth at international level
8328729 in fairness to manny hes come on leaps and bounds from a premier league team in victoria and hes done a sterling job but we signed david mulligan as a right back and this weekends probably a good chance to have a look at him
8328730 its been tough and hard and a little bit lonely for him getting up to the required fitness levels but weve set a benchmark and the players need to reach it
8328731 its probably time to pop him in there and have a look
8328732 i think it would be a tough call to leave him out
8328733 all i look for in the players is the reality and the honesty that youve made mistakes
8328734 there is still a relatively large gap between china and the best in the world in the high profile items like athletics swimming and cycling and also in the popular ball sports
8328735 also we have already mined our full potential in our strong sports at beijing only through widening our gold winning face can we adapt to the fierce competition in future
8328736 these problems require earnest reflection to build courage from shame and to make up lost ground
8328737 all of us except for hayden roulston want to stay together as much as we can for the next four years a couple of those guys in the great britain squad are getting old now and theyre probably not going to be around forever
8328738 with another four years and a world championship under our belt we think we can get up there put it this way weve definitely got room for improvement
8328739 to come so close and not get it 6000 left me a bit disappointed id set myself a high standard and to come home with just one pb personal best out of the seven events was a little disappointing
8328740 but i went in ranked 22nd and came out 22nd so i cant complain
8328741 i finished fourth in the commonwealth in beijing and didnt even do a pb score so definitely think its possible as for london id say possibly
8328742 we looked at putting more funding into it but we dont have a lot of reserves ourselves and the board felt it could not justify it
8328743 i could go if people think thats the right thing because the buck stops with me but i dont know if that fixes the problem
8328744 jan cameron the canterbury rugby union the city council and canterbury basketball were all involved and it all looked promising
8328745 but when the council decided they could not commit to it no one else was able to keep it going
8328746 i have already been in talks with basketball australia in beijing and they want us to be involved the following season after how well the girls performed last time
8328747 theres intentions to meet with greg and his management company yes
8328748 weve extended an invitation its just a case of confirmation as to when and where
8328749 obviously hell be getting some legal advice its just a case of when there is a stage that things have settled down i assume so were just waiting on that
8328750 its just a case of finding out what did occur
8328751 i wont be making the decision alone its a full club decision
8328752 i will find out something at the end of the week i hope in the near future anyway
8328753 but it is looking very likely that i will be going back to europe
8328754 there has been some positive talk and it is a big goal of my mine to go back
8328755 i have always wanted to go back ever since i decided to quit the big team discovery over there it is really hard to get back in there at the moment because a lot of teams are stopping it is supply and demand
8328756 there are a lot of riders on the market and very little teams
8328757 to get back over there will be very very hard but i am quite confident i can go back
8328758 i will have a rest mentally i wont be doing any training for the next two to three weeks but i will be doing something mountain biking running or the gym just to keep fit
8328759 it is all overwhelming to be honest it seems so long ago since i won the medals that everyone would have forgotten its mind blowing to see everyone here
8328760 naturally i wanted sharelle out there leading the team but knowing sharelles on court intensity it was not worth taking the risk and playing her at this stage
8328761 we are taking a conservative approach to ensure she gets her body right for next year and beyond
8328762 ultimately while she is disappointed to not be taking part in the international series this is about the long term welfare of sharelle mcmahon in the australia netball team
8328763 this is an important series but we are at the start of an exciting four year cycle that includes the commonwealth games and world championships
8328764 if rushing back now without being fully fit puts these longer term goals in jeopardy then it isnt worth the risk
8328765 we put our reputation and everything we had on the line to do this and from a personal point of view i guaranteed basketball australia this would work
8328766 i take full responsibility for it not working and what i am saying to the girls is if they are looking for heads to roll and someone to resign the only person offering to resign should be me
8328767 play a leading role in establishing the working relationship between sirens partners basketball new zealand and canterbury basketball
8328768 weve made several requests to him for an understanding of their financial position and what we are going to do about the sirens going forward

8328770 in the belief that this step would also assist the labour party in its relationship with mr peters
8328771 mr peters subsequently met me socially at the karaka yearling sales i believe in early 2006 he thanked me for my assistance
8328772 the fact that a minister is in his job is a statement that i have confidence in them
8328773 bnz is one of many banks internationally that has seen an increase in attempted fraudulent transactions on cards recently used in the uk
8328774 i think its a bit shocking for all of us because with that ruling it sets a precedent now
8328775 i guess therell be nothing of the sort bringing down lineouts like that even though it wasnt a real bad one it sets a precedent now
8328776 any interference of this kind carries real danger and a sanction is required
8328777 ive lost a couple of kilos so ive just got to get that back on before the weekend
8328778 its like one of the things that could only happen to me
8328779 it could have been picked up from my hands something i picked up food anything so all we know is it was a pretty bad case to keep me out for that game which was real disappointing
8328780 ive had something to eat this morning which was pretty much the first thing in three days which i kept down
8328781 i think whether they bring stirling into inside centre or timana theyve both got the ability to ball play
8328782 its more just getting your head around it that youve got to ball play more instead of being those runners
8328783 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system director of the department of diabetes endocrinology and metabolism at sydneys royal north shore hospital greg fulcher said in a statement
8328784 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8328785 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8328786 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication dr fulcher said
8328787 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation
8328788 indistinguishable from endogenous islet beta cells in size shape and ultrastructure
8328789 this approach may prove to be a general strategy for directing adult cell reprogramming
8328790 it could be a kind of parallel approach for how to make cells for regenerative medicine
8328791 the beta cells do not organize into islet structures and remain as single cells or small clusters
8328792 signaling between beta cells inhibits basal insulin secretion and enhances glucose stimulated insulin secretion the lack of organization of reprogrammed beta cells undoubtedly impairs their function
8328793 further studies will be necessary to understand why this particular combination is sufficient for adult beta cell reprogramming

8328817 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system director of the department of diabetes endocrinology and metabolism at sydneys royal north shore hospital greg fulcher said in a statement
8328818 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8328819 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8328820 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication dr fulcher said
8328821 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation

8328823 ive never had such a staggered harvest last year was grotty but this is on a par with 1985
8328824 its heart breaking but the price seemed good at the time
8328825 if we get towards 30cwt acre we think were doing well
8328826 we shant really know until we get into the 60 acres we need to cut conventionally because we want the straw for cattle but i reckon moisture wise were half to 1 better off with the header were cooking as hard as we can go
8328827 were quite pleased with that although it has had some fusarium in it its a known weakness of the variety
8328828 it did 74cwt acre it was meant for seed but it will now only make feed
8328829 i reckon it was assisted by all the moisture weve had

8328832 by assessing the soil structure the teams had to decide what would be the most suitable cultivations for establishing winter wheat to maximise yield and minimise the effects on the environment
8328833 you would have to do things wrong to cause erosion and some of the groups clearly did
8328834 they were also free to choose varieties to see if any preferred different cultivation techniques
8328835 however at the beginning of july we assessed root development by measuring the volume at different depths in the soil and found some interesting variation in growth between the plots
8328836 the best root distribution followed the carrier drilling which may be because the machinery used was lighter
8328837 so we took some leaf rolling scores by assessing how tightly the flag leaves were curled around mid day
8328838 again this indicated not unsurprisingly that where root distribution was best there was less leaf rolling

8328851 theres always the possibility if it comes from the right direction and if it is large enough to create storm surge in the realm of katrina that there could be overtopping

8328885 its inspiring how small business was the first to return to the city even as chain retailers were slow to re open
8328886 theres a lesson there for any community in distress after a disaster particularly in neighborhoods where residents are reluctant to return due to a lack of services including retail
8328887 katrina wasnt new orleans first brush with catastrophe and it wont be her last even as gustav bears down on the gulf coast and new orleans residents find themselves deciding whether to evacuate or not we know that no matter what happens new orleans local businesses will be back first when we need them after any natural disaster to offer us a cup of coffee or the building supplies we need to help us get back on our feet and return to normalcy as quickly as possible
8328888 economic development efforts that focus on helping the businesses born and raised here grow to their full potential will have a much greater impact with a much smaller price tag for a resource strapped city and her taxpayers

8328937 i already have so much flash built into my web site i dont know where to start with silverlight
8328938 the idea that microsoft isnt interested in using silverlight on its sites is of course completely wrong to assume that a project team with any company would simply throw out a project plan already in motion ramp their developers and designers in a new technology and start over for the simple fact that there is a new way of accomplishing their goal is ridiculous
8328939 i can all but guarantee you that there are roadmaps in place to adopt silverlight across most or all of the microsoft web assets

8328980 rcmoya i would agree that as a whole they are not more racist than other segments of the population but the woman in the interview made it quite clear that obamas lack of qualification stemmed pretty much solely from his being registered a muslim

8329001 kindle is actually a tough product to sell at retail

8329022 the magnetic field is the only common and most likely factor responsible for the observed alignment
8329023 our analysis clearly provides the crucial proof in favor of the earths magnetic field being the responsive cue
8329024 our findings challenge neuroscientists and biophysics to explain the proximate mechanisms
8329025 the magnetic field is the only common and most likely factor responsible for the observed alignment
8329026 because wind and light conditions could be excluded as a common denominator determining the body axis orientation magnetic alignment is the most parsimonious explanation
8329027 wind if the wind was the primary factor deter mining alignment of the evaluated cattle it has to be presumed that there were windy and not windless conditions in most of the 308 sampled pastures distributed geographically and in time we had to presume further more that winds were strong and blowing mainly from northern or southern directions this is highly improbable because in the northern hemisphere westerlies and in the southern hemisphere south eastern trades are prevailing and generally air f low is def lected by the coriolis force and tends to follow more east west e w direction rather than n s

8329033 hey look this is what i am going to do either way but at least you can help me do it safer
8329034 usually in people taking moderate doses of the drug you see some sort of mild acne but in severe cases it can ulcerate

8329036 that was taken to show he used to do steroids

8329053 these converter boxes are all capable of handling their basic function reasonably well and theyll enable you to use an analog tv after the switch to all digital broadcasts still if you want optimal picture quality from digital broadcasts youd be better off buying a decent digital tv
8329054 we obviously dont want to have fewer viewers weve been involved in educating the public about this for years it is what it is
8329055 i dont know if its an issue of converter box quality as much as its an issue of antennas
8329056 there are so many variables reception quality depends on where youre located whether youre in an apartment building or a single family home with an antenna on the roof when you hook up the converter box youve got to make sure youve got a proper antenna if you dont youll either see nothing or it will look pixelated
8329057 no there is no software update that is how the box is supposed to operate
8329058 why did they even put a guide on the box
8329059 the picture and sound are great and the extra channels were a welcome addition
8329060 of those who bought converter boxes weve heard nothing but complaints
8329061 converter box users say the channel selection stinks and the reception is grainy
8329062 if it isnt easy and cost effective for anyone to upgrade to digital tv
8329063 when you hook up the converter box youve got to make sure youve got a proper antenna
8329064 theres serious concern that those analog households could abandon tv altogether

8329091 januvia boosts the effect of a natural body process called the incretin system director of the department of diabetes endocrinology and metabolism at sydneys royal north shore hospital greg fulcher said in a statement
8329092 incretins are intestinal hormones which are released after food intake and they are essential for regulating blood glucose
8329093 research has shown that people with type two diabetes have an impaired incretin system so their body is unable to lower blood glucose effectively
8329094 this is the first time we have been able to address an impaired incretin system using an oral medication dr fulcher said
8329095 by increasing the number of intact incretins in the body januvia helps to control on demand the high blood glucose levels that may contribute to serious long term health problems such as heart attack stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage and amputation
8329096 i work really hard off the court to try and get the rewards in these tournaments
8329097 you know in the past i felt nervous coming into the bigger tournaments but now that ive started to work really hard off the court you go into the matches with no excuses no worries
8329098 you just go on the court and just to play tennis and thats one of the few things that im good at and its worked out much better for me this year
8329099 i spent about four or five weeks out in florida training that means being away from your family for obviously that period of time when you could be at home training in really hot conditions and going in the gym a couple of times a day
8329100 its a complete waste of time going on the court and finding reasons why you might lose the match and what have you
8329101 you know you just go out there and fight for every single point because thats a complete waste of time putting the work in if youre not going to use it out on the court
8329102 and its really been the first time early this year when i felt really good going on the court physically and its something thats nice to sort of show that youre in great shape because i think it sends a message to the other players
8329103 i saw his match against richard in wimbledon and after the match i said if he can play this kind of match he was down two sets to love and won after so i was impressed
8329104 he plays a lot of good rallies and its going to be tough for sure
8329105 im going to play my game you know i do serve and volley so i have to play like normal and to put some pressure on his serve
8329106 i saw his match in beijing he didnt play good but you know every week anything can happen
8329107 i know he gave up the vice captaincy a little while ago because there were a few issues there and there probably still are a few issues
8329108 but if its as a stand in and an emergency i dont think he will say no to helping the team out
8329109 i said to the guys in the changing room after the game that not all is lost
8329110 we have been 2 0 down before and came back to win that series in pakistan somehow we have got to try to do it again
8329111 it seems a long way away to win three games in a row but england have won two in a row and its only one more game than that
8329112 theres no reason why we cant change momentum its going to take a massive effort from the senior players but its an opportunity for us to stand up and be counted
8329113 we have talked about trying to forget what happened at trent bridge but you cant
8329114 one or two of the senior guys are really going to have to respond now if we are going to have any chance at all in the series
8329115 its not as if we were not there it was different from the first game when all the batsmen got in and then gave it away and got out at bad times
8329116 but that is the way we decided to go with selection we are playing wicket taking bowlers
8329117 we were criticised in the past for not having wicket takers so we have gone with this kind of selection
8329118 so it is about knuckling down and one of the top four has to bat through and get a hundred every time
8329119 we dont want to pack the team with nine batsmen and send the message to the top order that there are other people that can do the job
8329120 to my supporters to my champions to my sisterhood of the traveling pant suits from the bottom of my heart thank you thank you because you never gave in and you never gave up and together we made history

8329249 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8329250 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8329251 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8329252 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8329253 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8329254 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8329255 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8329256 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8329257 the data are much stronger than expected for manufacturing probably showing continued strong export demand
8329258 manufacturing continues to do remarkably well given the weakness in the labor market and stresses in the financial system and likely continues to benefit from overseas growth
8329259 we have decided to immediately discontinue the disablement of our nuclear facilities that has been under way in accordance with the oct 3 6 party agreement we will consider taking actions to quickly restore the yongbyon nuclear facilities at the strong request of our related institutions
8329260 especially as implementing the verification guideline is a very difficult job where we need to coordinate the different position and interests of the six parties

8329262 he was held under terrible conditions his tongue was cut and he was even physically attacked
8329263 to argue successfully for the postponement of a now defunct english high court case in which pakistans government was suing zardari over alleged corruption
8329264 it refers to something three years old he is fit and well he was jogging around the prime ministers house just a moment ago
8329265 i dont know if someones going to raise it or not but being of sound mind is a condition of becoming president
8329266 his opponents may bring it up to attack mr zardari and submit a petition to the election commission

8329277 whether your interest is in cruising safaris golfing or just a days adventure omega will be happy to show you all the possibilities of making that dream vacation finally become a reality
8329278 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8329279 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8329280 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8329281 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8329282 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8329283 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8329284 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8329285 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8329286 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8329287 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8329288 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8329289 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8329290 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8329291 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8329292 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8329293 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8329294 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8329295 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8329296 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8329297 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8329347 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8329348 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

8329364 we are disappointed the secretary of state will not be required to give voters the crucial piece of information they will need to make an informed choice
8329365 the payday lending ballot measure is no reform at all it threatens our pocketbooks the health of our economy and the integrity of our ballot initiative process
8329366 the truth in lending act the law of the land for forty years requires that the cost of credit be stated as both a dollar finance charge and as an annual percentage rate
8329367 the purpose of the truth in lending act is to enable consumers to make informed choices about credit based on an apples to apples comparison regardless of the mix of fees and interest used by lenders to hide the true cost of loans
8329368 lenders from pawn shops to mortgage brokers are required to clearly disclose the apr to inform consumers
8329369 its now up to arizona citizens to inform themselves about what this ballot measure really means
8329370 i think they will given the independence and critical thinking that is characteristic of our state its just a shame that the secretary of state didnt put the interest rate right there on the ballot as our coalition requested weeks ago
8329371 payday lenders will be legally allowed to operate in arizona after the interest rate exemption expires in 2010 as long as they keep their interest rates under 36 percent as other lenders already must do or they can close up shop if they cant survive on that the choice is theirs
8329372 the point is 400 percent interest rates must end and voters should reject prop 200
8329373 no the really cruel bit was having to watch jamie goo and gaa at baby chickens

8329375 national party leader john key has effectively ruled out having new zealand first leader and foreign minister winston peters as a minister in any government he leads and called on helen clark to stand him down from her cabinet
8329376 that is what i would do if i were prime minister
8329377 helen clark has stood ministers from labour down for much less
8329378 national is shedding support to chief rival labour as the election nears but it still has enough backing to govern the country alone in the latest herald digipoll survey like several other polls over the past month the august digipoll shows a narrower gap between the two major parties of 13 7 percentage points far smaller than the 24 6 point difference seen in the same poll in july john key and helen clark are neck and neck as preferred prime minister national registers 50 per cent support in the poll still a huge number given that an election is less than three months away but the trend will be something of a worry to the party with its support dropping 5 4 points since july while labours has lifted 5 5 points to 36 3 per cent
8329379 the challenge for mr obama in establishing his identity as the best economic steward for a hurting nation was evident with tuesday nights highlight the speech by senator hillary rodham clinton mrs clinton who nearly won the democratic nomination with a late appeal to middle class anxieties used her formal concession to restate those campaign themes and to make a rousing case for reversing eight years of conservative economic policies though with mr obama as president but it is not clear whether her substantive case would break through the story line about how well she would do in easing tensions with mr obama and unifying the party and just like on monday night when an emotional appearance by senator edward m kennedy of massachusetts and a speech by michelle obama dominated the coverage the roster of speakers seeking to promote mr obama as the answer to the countrys economic ills and mr mccain as worse than a third bush term was barely seen on television that blurring of the intended focus on mr obamas economic message captures a continuing struggle that mr obama is having with four nights of free prime time television coverage he is trying to define himself personally for voters and to win over holdout clinton supporters while at the same time seeking to define himself substantively failing at either could cost him the election
8329380 the auckland city council is hoping the 8 9 million upgrade of a reserve will act as an inner city getaway for workers an official site blessing and sod turning ceremony yesterday marked the start of work on st patricks square but some city leaders say the council has not spent enough on the upgrade located besides st patricks cathedral between albert swanson and wyndham sts the square is the largest area of open green space from the middle of town to the waterfront according to the council the project due to be completed in november next year will include trees water features artworks lighting paving and seating areas
8329381 honestly there is no answer it has just been one of those winters we have been locked into a nasty weather cycle that we cant shake
8329382 while its not common to have these weather cycles it does happen occasionally new zealand is exposed to storms from all directions and we can see some wild swings in rainfall from one year to the next
8329383 its looking more settled in spring and summer so hopefully theres light at the end of the tunnel
8329384 your ceaseless babble is totally tiresome and you never say what you mean cant you just shut up
8329385 i abhor it the exterior which the final surplus went coming likewise more to the surplus than the surplus over the losses
8329386 theory which confounds that they arrived there from the friend
8329387 the free sector set this in the past during its reduction
8329388 this ignores the realities of policing where an emergency could require all sworn staff to report to frontline duty at a moments notice
8329389 but we would not expect the public to be any less protected
8329390 it felt like i was inside a deep fryer like an overcooked chip it knocked me down and i was still convulsing after the first hit
8329391 the long summer drought eventually broke in may and since then it has been a pretty wet winter
8329392 the rain is not what we would call intense but with the ground already so wet there is nowhere for it to go except pond and cause problems
8329393 this thing is 1 5 metres wide 80 metres off the ground and its now perched very precariously
8329394 theyre trying to decide what to do with it because if it falls down it will take out the powerlines to the whole street
8329395 as a society we cannot accept or tolerate these consequences we must do everything we can to avoid this harm within reason
8329396 we cannot ignore the position of a child sex offender who has served his sentence and has been released into the community
8329397 that person due to the nature of his or her convictions presents as a risk to the community but he or she is also a person who may be determined to re establish himself as a law abiding member of society
8329398 as a community we need to know what we can do to protect our children from sex offenders not just one individual who moves into a particular area
8329399 if those people are open to and willing to enter treatment thats when we need to get them on to methadone not six months later or even three weeks later
8329400 the horse could have bolted by then thereby missing a very important chance to both improve the overall societal effects and certainly that individuals health
8329401 most people i know with opiate addictions they dont like themselves either when theyre in addiction its not a nice world
8329402 abscesses that are taking calves apart and gaping holes in thighs
8329403 youve got the shackles of addiction and the shackles of procuring a black market drug generally its a fairly chaotic lifestyle in most areas prior to going on to treatment but that treatment generally turns that around pretty quickly
8329404 people on the programme have very little control over their addiction or their lives i dont want to be told to take a full dose every day
8329405 but with the new damage and the loss of previous repairs we think that this will probably run closer to 3m now
8329406 there has also been a lot of goodwill and manpower from council staff firefighters police and ambulance personnel which often gets lost when considering the costs of these events
8329407 the road through to blenheim opened this morning wednesday a single lane the road through to christchurch from kaikoura opened at 4 30pm single lane again in a lot of places
8329408 by violent attacks i refer to unprovoked assaults fighting and the like
8329409 this often results in real harm to members of the public
8329410 what an opportunity to see what was going on in the industry
8329411 everything has to be spot on it is really like an orchestra
8329412 these are the final resting places of those service men and women who bravely put themselves in harms way overseas for the freedom and lifestyle we including the thieves enjoy yesterday
8329413 i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
8329414 jesus was basically saying in matthew the way youre going to enter the kingdom is if you trust me in the same way these children do
8329415 central to entering the kingdom like a child is entrusting that which is owning head space gripping your heart or draining you by the moment to god and saying im not going to let that worry that stress that anxiety own me
8329416 the key things we will be looking for are the state of its balance sheet and whether it is in a position to survive during the next 12 months or so
8329417 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8329418 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8329419 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8329420 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8329421 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8329422 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8329423 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8329424 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8329425 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8329426 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8329427 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions
8329428 its a really bad bug that really impacts every web site you use and your readers use
8329429 it impacts whether or not readers are even going to see the article youre about to write
8329430 we got thirteen days of a patch being out without the bug being public
8329431 thats unprecedented im pretty proud of at least thirteen days i would have liked thirty but i got thirteen
8329432 dont give 4 0s cause my standard is too high
8329433 this is a momentous decision compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered the next step is for the british government to demand an end to the charade against him in guant namo bay and return him home to britain
8329434 it is a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained by torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used as evidence in any trial
8329435 hugely dependent in a number of areas on us intelligence
8329436 any disclosure however limited would seriously undermine this principle to the point that future cooperation between the uk and its most valuable intelligence partner the us would be severely jeopardised
8329437 it was accepted on behalf of the foreign secretary that bm binyam mohamed had established an arguable case i that over the period april 2002 to may 2004 he was first held by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer or a court or tribunal in pakistan and then detained there or elsewhere by the united states until his arrival in guant namo bay in september 2004 ii that he was subject to cruel inhuman and degrading treatment by or on behalf of the united states during such detention and iii that he was subject to torture during such detention by or on behalf of the united states
8329438 the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing
8329439 that on the basis that what was done was arguably wrongdoing the sys security service facilitated it in the manner and to the extent described
8329440 conduct of the security service facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states when bm was being detained by the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan in the period april 2002 until at least may 2002 the court also concluded that the security service continued to facilitate the interviewing of bm by providing information and questions after 17 may 2002 in the knowledge of what was reported to them as to the circumstances of his detention and treatment in pakistan
8329441 uk is under no obligation under international law to assist foreign courts and tribunals in assuring that torture evidence is not admitted
8329442 if it is correct that in the course of an interrogation in which material supplied by the defendant the british government was employed the claimant binyam mohamed was tortured then it is arguable that there is an obligation to disclose material which may assist claimant in establishing before the american military court that he was tortured whether the court should exercise its discretion not to order disclosure can only be determined at a full hearing
8329443 could be considered exculpatory or might otherwise be relevant in the context of proceedings before the military commissions
8329444 the united kingdom armed forces are trained in the laws of armed conflict set out in the geneva conventions the joint services intelligence organisations training documentation states that the following techniques are expressly and explicitly forbidden a physical punishment of any sort b the use of stress positions c intentional sleep deprivations d withdrawal of food water or medical treatment and three other specified techniques

8329473 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

8329481 i do believe on thursday the outdoor auditorium will be full to capacity
8329482 it will be a historic event that we are going to see a black man accept the nomination of my party so how could i not be proud to be an american and to be a democrat
8329483 i will vote for a yellow dog before i ever vote for a republican so it doesnt matter who the nominee is at the end of the day i will support sen obama 100 percent because anything is better than four more years of failed bush policy
8329484 the best thing for the democrat party was george w bush
8329485 we couldnt have asked for a better person to unify our party
8329486 hillary clinton was my obama from a previous generation she could relate to the people of louisiana and the youth of earlier generations
8329487 be an audience in the drama dont try to act in it
8329488 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8329489 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8329490 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8329491 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8329492 im just not ready yet to put on an obama t shirt
8329493 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8329494 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8329495 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8329496 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8329497 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8329498 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8329499 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8329500 who are open to doing something on the production side
8329501 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

8329511 thats how were going to do it its getting down to the nitty gritty now
8329512 growing up on a farm in the 1940s and 50s i remember that we called our milk cows from the pasture by calling come boss come boss lengthening the vowel the second time when calling the pigs to the trough we called sooey sooey or sui pick pick i know that boss comes from the latin bos and sooey from the latin sus what im wondering is how these words came to survive in a german speaking colony immigrating in the 1840s and 50s with education rarely achieving the eighth grade and little english spoken the first hundred years in america having visited our ancestral village in kruchten i learned that it was one of the most economically deprived areas of germany due to the fluctuation of german and french rule with the unlikelihood that there was much of a classical education however the area around trier germany was one of the largest roman outposts in the roman empire my question is there a possibility that our minnesotan words could possibly have originated in the latin of the roman empire
8329513 in new england farmers shout ho boss when calling their cows
8329514 is it by any chance the saxon word handed down from father to son or has it been handed down to the cowman from the monks
8329515 the latin words in the english language and still in common use come to us direct from the times of the roman dominion in britain
8329516 was apparently shortened before it had a chance to become a diphthong
8329517 i am writing to ask regarding the difference in meaning between the words
8329518 it has become common for some authors writing on chemistry physics and measurement of gas borne particles aerosols to use the words particle s and particulate s synonymously my dictionary indicates that particulate can indeed be used either as an adjective or a noun suggesting that they can be synonyms i feel that when the noun is called for particle always reads better
8329519 the literature is undecided whether to call the infection of the human skin by the organism demodex demodicosis or demodicidosis i favor the former as a profusion or widespread of demodex i see the latter as a corrupted or possibly misspelled neologism suggesting the widespread presence of the agent used to kill demodex i e demodecide or demodicide likely the latter

8329528 the campaigns have determined how this is going to work
8329529 i understand that the clinton delegates want to serve their constituents that is what im doing but i dont want this to be a hollow victory for obama

8329795 most of our respondents continue to use catalogs as their dominant or secondary channel of marketing and sales
8329796 and our data suggests a consensus among successful marketers that there are consistent and integrated standards across all channels as virtually all use some form of internet marketing to supplement their catalog channel
8329797 to control vehicle and pedestrian traffic the crossing guards will use the following standardized whistle signals one long blast of the whistle to alert traffic to stop one short blast from the whistle and an arm signal to the children that it is safe to cross two blasts of the whistle followed by an arm signal to motorists that they may proceed through the intersection after looking both ways
8329798 the 3 000 year old skeletons were in such good condition that anthropologists at the university of goettingen managed to extract a sample of dna that was then matched to two men living nearby uwe lange a surveyor and manfred huchthausen a teacher the two men have now become local celebrities

8329810 im just glad i was able to help battling smug is just one small step toward improving the environment here in san francisco and by extension making the world a better place for all of us

8329821 first and foremost telecom carriers need to differentiate their approach to the advertising market
8329822 this is particularly important given the fact that advertising money is being pursued by their immediate telecom competitors consumer device manufacturers such as nokia and internet related companies like google yahoo myspace and microsoft
8329823 if a carrier can execute its advertising strategy well and overcome the key challenges it could move quickly to reap the benefits
8329824 carriers can expect to become an integral part of consumers lifestyles when they can reliably deliver relevant advertisements to them this will require closer cooperation and partnerships with other businesses such as retailers restaurants and cinemas
8329825 ive kind of warned everybody up there that i think theyve gotten a little too into this idea which i mean is great

8329833 faced with growing ridership on the commuter trains the constant rise in demand our development projects and our dependency on petroleum we clearly had to renew our locomotives and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions
8329834 the amt cannot say for now how many cars or locomotives will be deployed per line
8329835 the east train a project unveiled in late 2006 serving the east and north east of the island will of course be a priority with five locomotives and 20 cars and the rest will be deployed according to the age of the material already rolling into place
8329836 were in a hurry for this electric transport we need it

8329838 were aware of the matter discussed tonight by the aurora police department
8329839 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now
8329840 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8329841 clearly we feel there are federal implications beyond that i cant elaborate

8329849 the strength in durable goods is just the latest indication that manufacturing is actually holding in quite well and thats a really big plus
8329850 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8329851 the weakness the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8329852 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good

8329867 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8329868 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8329869 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8329870 the dawn chorus may be a way of communicating having survived the night
8329871 if in the morning a bird doesnt hear its neighbor or an anole doesnt see its neighbor it may be an opportunity for the animal to expand its territory
8329872 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
8329873 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8329874 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8329875 so why did elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall to levels similar to the pre industrial era that is the million dollar question which researchers will no doubt be trying to answer during the next few years
8329876 weve made movies to show this traffic jam as a function of energy at some energies the traffic is moving and at others the electron traffic is completely blocked
8329877 it has been a frustrating and embarrassing problem to explain why this is the case
8329878 its like taking some cars off the highway during rush hour all of a sudden the traffic starts to move
8329879 in essence the research shows that what is believed to be required to increase the superconductivity in these systems stronger magnetic interactions also pushes the system closer to the quantum traffic jam status where lack of holes locks the electrons into positions from which they cannot move its like gassing up the cars and then jamming them all onto the highway at once theres lots of energy but no ability to go anywhere
8329880 we need to look for materials with such strong pairing but which dont exhibit this mottness or quantum traffic jam effect
8329881 our hope is that they will have less traffic jam effect while having stronger electron pairing
8329882 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8329883 suppose you are an alien flying over earth and identifying urban areas from the concentration of lights in the night from the brightness of the lights you may surmise for example that more humans live in los angeles than in mumbai but this is not the case
8329884 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8329885 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8329886 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
