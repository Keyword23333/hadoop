3490000 this needs to be shoved in the face of every single elected official in the country
3490001 we can fix this in a second we are talking about two or three sentences in legislation we are talking about the integrity of our democracy
3490002 we had a 14 year old kid stabbed to death and it got a paragraph in the chronicle
3490003 i think the community feels like these things are going unnoticed ive been trying to get the mayors office to react but basically theres nobody home
3490004 bipartisan commissions of lawyers and other leaders reflecting the diversity of the profession and the community
3490005 a searing indictment of the election process as it affected both the 2004 and 2006 elections and could affect the outcome of the 2008 election
3490006 our country has a long and varied history of stolen elections systematic disenfranchisement and manufactured election irregularities
3490007 yet most of us still accept on faith the integrity of the election process i hope that watching uncounted so close to the presidential election will shake to the core any preconceived beliefs and encourage immediate action before its too late
3490008 the notion of stolen elections is something we assign to third world countries but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as
3490009 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3490010 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3490011 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3490012 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3490013 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3490014 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3490015 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3490016 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3490017 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3490018 when i got to broomfield colo i was a nervous wreck
3490019 i had to wait a whole week i had the best week ever when i came home on saturday
3490020 i had no idea no idea how to put a magazine together
3490021 we have come a long way and we are not that far apart
3490022 lets work together lets bring this odyssey to a close today
3490023 the drop in starts in july was likely slightly overstated with the weakness largely concentrated in ontario however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year
3490024 i would suggest there is a worrying trend that we are seeing such significant drop offs
3490025 starts always follow sales and i can tell you sales are definitely trending down in 2008
3490026 its a tougher market out there i dont think we are in panic mode there isnt a huge concern but we are definitely slowing down to some extent
3490027 what you saw was a one month blip due to the multiple starts in ontario and thats mainly ontario
3490028 it looks like you have a google account would you like to link your youtube and google accounts
3490029 import your google contacts into youtube for messaging or sharing videos
3490030 this act the federal reserve act dec 23rd 1913 establishes the most gigantic trust on earth when the president woodrow wilson signs the bill the invisible government of the monetary power will be legalised the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking and currency bill
3490031 the thing is were on the warped tour now and weve never played warped before and were not like a typical warped band but i guess a lot of kids asked us to be there
3490032 so were playing the mosh set on warped because we want to make sure the kids get to beat the sh out of each other because we know thats what they like to do
3490033 when you think warped you dont think of a band like us
3490034 we wear a lot of bright clothes we shake our butts a lot were very sarcastic were electronic usually warped is about the mosh but the truth is the scene is changing a lot these days and what unites all the bands on warped isnt a specific musical sound but its more of an ethic there are so many different types of bands on warped i cant tell you how surprised i am to have made friends with some of these bands that i thought were totally going to think were pu s like story of the year i just thought theyd hate us they listen to metal they have tattoos and were best buds on this tour the common thread of warped is the ethic
3490035 the only rapper that could still get money in the drought
3490036 and i chill with the thugs and the gangsters too i aint a blood but im warring with the boys in blue crooked officer crooked officer why you wanna see me in a coffin sir
3490037 seen you jockin j c cause he got a mercedes and you know about his ladies
3490038 its the most exciting thing on the horizon and its the thing that when i wake up in the morning it makes me say god it would be cool if that happened
3490039 this is my grand ambition will it happen i dont know it was fun sitting and telling the hbo guys and watching them shake their heads and having writers on board and producers that are into it its been a fun thing
3490040 but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right
3490041 for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression
3490042 im ok with it my voice was used in the performance i think thats enough
3490043 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic
3490044 lets just make some versions of that with photoshop magic and re create them almost exactly
3490045 this is something major for the streets a lot of people who didnt or who dont normally get love from other outlets can count on ozone to shed some light on them
3490046 after all these years the only award ive ever received was a ozone award
3490047 so i love the show its the third year it keeps getting better

3490054 were selling at the same time with the same finishes as trump but hes asking 800 a square foot
3490055 some people walked away because they didnt believe we could do this
3490056 by the time we started building aqua last february it was 85 percent sold which translated into a lower interest rate on our 405 million construction loan

3490059 hampshire is definitely an up and coming community and a great place to live our buyers have recognized the great combination of classic small town america that offers peaceful surroundings and down home charm along with the convenience of being a short drive from outstanding shopping and dining with easy access to the expressway
3490060 its not just the amenities offered within lakewood crossing that have attracted so many buyers its also the growth that has taken place in the surrounding area that has helped make living in hampshire very convenient and enjoyable
3490061 the surge in contemporary architecture means there is an alternative to bland buildings its a breath of fresh air
3490062 the views are better and there is more light inside
3490063 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3490064 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3490065 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3490066 there is no incentive to pass along the benefits of decreased capital expenditures as a result of increased efficiencies to the consumer
3490067 wireless services are a mature market the remaining 40 of canadians need further incentive to become connected in most cases these consumers do not
3490068 a big part of the story is enabling a mobile workforce
3490069 the market for mobile data in this country right now is nothing compared to what its going to be over the next 10 years the industry is going to generate at least 200 billion in revenue
3490070 accelerate innovation in mobile and offer consumers a richer less expensive and better mobile experience

3490072 the only way for the the android project to fail would be if the os just sucked
3490073 everytime i clap my hands a child in africa dies
3490074 our goal at the end of the day is lower prices better services and more choices
3490075 when you see new construction on teardown sites craftsman and prairie style architectural designs tend to dominate
3490076 by contrast the hillside manor offers a fresh new look for this area one that sports a timeless charm and old world character
3490077 the easier and less expensive but potentially least effective approach was to connect to the storm sewer in the street at the front of the home
3490078 weve carefully considered just about every detail imaginable in this home
3490079 from installing electric outlets under the eaves for easy holiday light decorating to prewiring the great room for home theater equipment we know that its the small details and fine touches that capture the imagination of the homeowner
3490080 the space is very well executed its a true european kitchen
3490081 theyll have to strip search everyone who crosses that border or they wont know who we are

3490083 having access to transit will allow residents to leave their vehicle at home
3490084 this will result in fewer greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions and a healthier community given caledons environmental commitments we feel this is a win win for our environment and community
3490085 the region works hard to support public transit improvements and this includes accommodating residents who wish to travel out of region for work school or other activities
3490086 bolton residents will now have a more convenient access to go bus service minimizing the need to drive and park at the go train station
3490087 ridership on the bolton go bus route has increased by about 40 per cent since this time last year and its great to be growing along with this region
3490088 were always looking for opportunities to give people more transit options
3490089 the new go bus stop is located in boltons core which will provide convenience for nearby residents and businesses
3490090 go is an important link for the people of bolton and having public transit provides residents a handy option over their cars for travel
3490091 the response from our families and local religious leaders has been positive
3490092 we speak of progress but leave all the important jobs to menfolk religious duties have nearly solely been a male premise not only in islam but also in other religions
3490093 there is nothing wrong if a woman conducts a nikah if she has the same knowledge as her male counterpart
3490094 android may catch rim and apple looking the wrong way
3490095 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3490096 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3490097 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3490098 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3490099 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3490100 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3490101 people who were hired in an improper way didnt themselves do anything wrong

3490104 solche themen werden im ausland nie angesprochen und daran sehe ich dass es so eine typisch deutsche sache ist ich glaube es geht die ffentlichkeit eigentlich gar nichts an wie lange oder wie oft man am tag trainiert
3490105 der trainer ist dazu da um alles zu bestimmen und armin veh hat gezeigt dass er sehr erfolgreich gearbeitet hat und da besteht berhaupt kein bedarf dass irgendjemand sich f r irgendwas rechtfertigt
3490106 tats chlich nur f nf minuten ber die sache gesprochen

3490113 cartooning is a solitary pursuit the cartoonist sits alone at a drawing table for most of his life struggling with himself and his past in an attempt to create something meaningful its the nature of the work i always tell aspiring artists that if they want to be cartoonists theyd better enjoy being by themselves the most important relationship they are going to have in their lives is with themselves
3490114 to make sure companies make it through what we expect to be a tumultuous financial period
3490115 as captain and players we will have to make sure he doesnt get himself into trouble because referees will be after him id say
3490116 they target certain players and its part of my job to make sure he doesnt react
3490117 what you see with dioufy is what you get youre not going to change the way he plays and the way he conducts himself but its up to us to make sure he doesnt overstep the mark

3490143 about two days ago i got pretty upset because since ive been here theyve tested me four times and they took blood a lot of blood
3490144 they are taking so much blood i am going to be very weak before the final of the 100 meters
3490145 he knows about it so its a bit strange he would complain
3490146 hes possibly exaggerating about the four tests but certainly he is part of the program he knows he will be tested more often
3490147 the point is its a good thing if hes been tested a lot
3490148 hes a favorite for the 100 meters so why not
3490149 blood tested once and urine tested once since ive been here
3490150 its what im doing to show my love for my sport
3490151 it comes with the territory past champions have tested positive but an olympic champion needs to carry himself clean to be clean and to be able to prove hes clean

3490189 india is home to approximately 2 5 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus hiv the third largest number of cases of any country in the world and is recognized as the source of increasing hiv prevalence among its south asian neighbors
3490190 despite reductions in prevalence of infection among the general population of india women account for a rising percentage of all hiv cases with husbands risk behavior described as the major source of womens infection intimate partner violence ipv has been described as being associated with heterosexual transmission of hiv to women in india and elsewhere
3490191 in this first national population based study of the relationship of husbands violence against wives to wives hiv infection status as indicated via diagnostic testing married indian women who experienced both physical and sexual ipv demonstrated an hiv infection prevalence approximately four times greater than that of non abused women
3490192 prevention of ipv may augment efforts to reduce the spread of hiv aids
3490193 findings of the present study based on both the large population based sample and the use of standard diagnostic testing for hiv infection should serve to confirm the nature of this relationship and move public health policy makers and practitioners to increase recognition of ipv as a critically important target in the global fight against hiv aids
3490194 these results are the first to prospectively quantify changes in alcohol use in relation to recent combat deployments interventions should focus on at risk groups including reserve guard personnel younger individuals and those with previous or existing mental health disorders further prospective analyses using data from this study group will evaluate timing duration and co existing illnesses of alcohol misuse and other alcohol related problems better defining the long term effect of military combat deployments on these important health outcomes
3490195 mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents globally have received little research attention even though mental health problems are one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease
3490196 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3490197 no changes were found on the other outcome variables traumatic idioms depressive anxiety symptoms and functioning the latter for boys
3490198 we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3490199 in short a school based psychosocial intervention was able to moderately reduce ptsd symptoms retain hope and improve functioning for girls and retain hope for boys affected by communal violence in a low income context
3490200 further adaptations and research to address the full range of post traumatic outcomes and functioning are necessary
3490201 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
3490202 the study has several clinical and programmatic implications first the greater burden of mental health problems among former child soldiers supports the need for focused programming which should include but not consist solely of interventions to reduce depression symptoms and the psychological sequelae of trauma especially bombings and torture as well as incorporate belongingness and income generation second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention
3490203 without screening there is a risk of pathologizing child soldiers as a group rather than providing support to those individuals most impaired finally the presence of mental health problems among never conscripted children illustrates the need for comprehensive postconflict community based psychosocial care not restricted only to child soldiers
3490204 liberias wars since 1989 have cost tens of thousands of lives and left many people mentally and physically traumatized
3490205 this conflict has been characterized by ethnic killings and massive abuses against the civilian population between 1989 and 1997 and again in 2003 and 2004
3490206 both female and male former combatants who experienced sexual violence had worse mental health outcomes than non combatants and other former combatants who did not experience exposure to sexual violence
3490207 like their female counterparts male former combatants who experienced sexual violence have worse mental health outcomes than both the general population and also other former combatants
3490208 rehabilitation programs that do not address this specific population risk failing a critically vulnerable group
3490209 this unexpected finding suggests that standard post conflict rehabilitation programs and gender based programs will need to adjust current programming to take into account males who have experienced sexual violence especially former combatants
3490210 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

3490212 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us

3490214 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3490215 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3490216 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3490217 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch

3490221 a women who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection in that his sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little control over sex or sexual protection
3490222 those clinicians working to prevent hiv infection among their female patients should consider violence from male partners as an important risk factor and ask about and attempt to intervene in such abuse to reduce this risk
3490223 more critically major national and global hiv prevention programs must include reducing mens ipv perpetration as a key target in the fight to stem the epidemic
3490224 this study should serve as a wake up call to us all if we as policymakers and practitioners are going to be truly successful in addressing the spread of hiv in india we must think of ways to address the all too widespread mistreatment of wives
3490225 intimate partner violence and hiv infection among married indian women
3490226 decoupling tree now is really taking a millstone off the other companys necks
3490227 we believe that this slowdown will accelerate throughout 2008 given the lag factor between revenues and investment banking job cuts and that markets will see very limited growth by q4
3490228 while the results are as expected we now see no positive catalysts in the next three months and believe short interest in the stock could increase

3490236 people talk about us being in the a 10 but its not about the conference
3490237 its about winning 30 games last year and going to the elite eight twice in the last five years we are a high major program

3490255 im well aware of the argument about singling out oil companies rather than soda pop manufacturers
3490256 i think oil companies are amoral they want to make as much money as they can for their shareholders which is what corporations do
3490257 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there
3490258 they need to be educated i get asked i want one of those plug ins like i saw my neighbor drive around
3490259 they just do not understand the technology challenges they dont understand where this stuff comes from they dont understand what its going to take to make us competitive here so that we can take the shutters off of 35 000 plants and make ourselves competitive again

3490281 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3490282 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3490283 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3490284 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3490285 the russian state has once again shown its face its true face

3490340 anthrax recombinant protective antigen rpa vaccine for the strategic national stockpile
3490341 the second quarter continued to be a highly productive period for pharmathene and sets the stage for a very exciting time for our company
3490342 over the next several months we expect to achieve a number of significant milestones which builds value for our stockholders
3490343 on july 31st 2008 we submitted a response to a request for proposals issued by the department of health and human services seeking procurement of 25 million doses of a second generation recombinant protective antigen rpa anthrax vaccine for inclusion in the strategic national stockpile the nations civilian stockpile of biodefense medical countermeasures
3490344 judging from prior contracts of this magnitude we estimate the potential value of an rpa vaccine contract could range from between 350 600 million and we believe that our product sparvax tm is well positioned to capture a meaningful share of this contract phase ii clinical trials have already been completed in over 700 healthy subjects and demonstrate that sparvax tm is well tolerated and induces an immune response in humans
3490345 in addition to our focus on sparvax tm we also anticipate a decision from the national institutes of health regarding development funding for a third generation rpa anthrax vaccine and next month we expect to begin a phase i trial of protexia r our nerve agent countermeasure which we believe will provide pre and post exposure prophylaxis against chemical nerve agents with the addition of avecias vaccine business we have created one of the industrys most robust biodefense portfolios firmly establishing pharmathene as a leading developer of urgently needed medical countermeasures to the united states government and foreign allies
3490346 we look forward to keeping the investment community apprised of our progress during this exciting time for our company
3490347 while iowa works hard on expanding health insurance coverage it is also important to ensure that our state has an adequate number of professionals to provide appropriate care
3490348 ensuring access to routine and preventive care will result in lives saved improved quality of life and reduced medical costs
3490349 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3490350 ive experienced that feeling where i have said let me just get a job as an accountant and leave my work at home
3490351 while the complexities of this proposal have yet to be vetted it seems doubtful that this is the sort of idea that oregonians could get behind
3490352 democrats in the legislature would prefer to store our water here at home before shipping it off to california
3490353 first and foremost while not closing our minds to long term viable solutions for state funding we are committed to ensuring that oregonians and our agricultural community have the stable and sufficient water supply they need
3490354 we are in the middle of a state wide water needs assessment and we will respond to those needs before we divert our water anywhere outside of oregon senate democrats have demonstrated leadership on this issue and im confident that we will continue our record of smart and sensible water planning for our state
3490355 we welcome the decision and at the same time we dont see why there should not be a reduction as world oil prices have come down
3490356 we are very pleased with our solid second quarter 2008 results which demonstrate the continued strength of our business model with 32 overall net revenue growth and 21 same market area net revenue growth in the second quarter in addition we continue to generate operating leverage as our revenue base expands resulting in year over year growth in our operating income margin to 8 1 from 7 1 our recently completed follow on public offering was well received in what is currently a very challenging equity market we believe this underscores the attractiveness of our business model and growth opportunities
3490357 during the quarter we closed two in market acquisitions which reflects part of our growth strategy to expand within existing markets in addition during the last few weeks we expanded our geographic reach by entering our 17th and 18th states through new hospital contracts in pennsylvania and ohio on august 1st we closed our previously announced acquisition of hospitalists of america which provides us with an entry into the southeast florida market our acquisition pipeline remains robust in this highly fragmented industry and we will continue to look for opportunities across the hospitalist sector
3490358 however im very fortunate to have an amazing bunch of female fans and im very thankful for them
3490359 this will be a perfect opportunity for the campaigns to articulate their policies
3490360 the next president will be in a unique position to move the space program forward space policy could also be key in the election many of the space states are too close to call in recent polls
3490361 digital future of the united states part i the future of the world wide web
3490362 i wish someone had sat me down and said look let me explain to you where youre at and what you have

3490366 it was on dude there was a reason to do it
3490367 if your boss is nasty to you you have no incentive to do well
3490368 you need to want to work for your boss or your company

3490371 given our ongoing focus on accelerating organic growth were pleased to have increased our opportunity pipeline to 28 3 billion including a record 2 2 billion of pending bids weve also repurchased 23 million of shares since the start of the june quarter and our board has authorized an additional 100 million stock buyback for the future
3490372 were enthusiastic about our july acquisitions of era corporation and interface amp control systems as both companies give us product capabilities and intellectual property in strategically important market segments their technologies are valuable differentiators as we move farther into large scale systems integration were pleased to welcome their employees to sra
3490373 the more profitable labor services component of revenue grew faster than total revenue again in fy 2008 we expect this trend to continue in fy09 leading to further margin expansion in light of the aits re compete decision we are pleased with the fy08 results and growth prospects for fy09
3490374 it is with great pleasure that i announce the biggest profit in the companys history
3490375 a significant rise in the price of oil on the international markets gains in the production of crude and gas the increase in prices related to the rise of gasoline and diesel last may and an increase in the total volume of sales
3490376 in the short term gold prices are likely to continue to take their lead from dollar movements and oil prices
3490377 the court of arbitration for sport cas has upheld the appeal filed by the international cycling union uci in a case involving the spanish cycling federation rfec and the spanish cyclist iban mayo
3490378 accordingly the cas disqualified iban mayo from the tour de france 2007 and imposed a two year ban as from 31 july 2007
3490379 im in good form and for the moment everything is going well
3490380 i am very confident as far as my chances are concerned in taking the gold medal home
3490381 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3490382 we know that were in a period of transition with the end of a generation
3490383 the young players who came to the euros experienced the bad side of things it will be useful for the future they know what they have to do to avoid a repeat
3490384 with sweden were going to prepare the final two matches for the 2010 world cup qualifiers we mustnt think of what will happen afterwards of my role otherwise how can we prevent the players from thinking about it as well
3490385 dont worry that its not good enough for anyone else to hear
3490386 we believe that there are some basic synergies for example awes focus on agent education and our new b 2 b tools
3490387 we believe education and training are keys to business success in fact theyre a fundamental part of our strategy if the agents who use our services cant grow our company will not grow
3490388 we wanted to take some of the sting out of those pesky airline taxes and surcharges that really annoy todays travelers
3490389 we figured that flying tax free is a great way to start your vacation almost like thumbing your nose at the high price of fuel as you jet across the pacific
3490390 and that extra money will go a long way when you get to the south pacific and asia where the us dollar is still worth something
3490391 the benefits are that they allow us to manage our clients and their work and our time and our stuff more efficiently and quicker and easier they essentially allow us to get on with what we are paid to do help solve our clients problems with minimal problems we have found that by spending less time and effort managing our business we can spend more time and effort helping our clients to run their businesses
3490392 whoever is spared personal pain must feel himself called to help in diminishing the pain of others we must all carry our share of the misery which lies upon the world
3490393 the achievement of one goal should be the starting point of another
3490394 im the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude
3490395 la crainte principale concerne l conomie et la forte chute de la demande
3490396 the highlight of the award banquet was the awarding of the john f kennedy medal to this years winner robert gessler from philadelphia as a friend of bobs for many years it was my pleasure to introduce and make some remarks about him including many of his accomplishments there were so many things bob did for the aoh that it was a simple task for me to give my remarks good luck bob in any of your future endeavors and we know you are always there for the aoh and the community
3490397 we rely on the repeat customers that we have built up over the years
3490398 theres a level of recognition and trust that weve managed to foster over the years it is something that we are very proud of
3490399 its a pleasure that we are able to offer schools rebates and other charitable programs through which they can do things like fund technology improvements bring in guest speakers or offer special assemblies
3490400 our effort is to try and get new members and have more neighborhood involvement it is just amazing to see these little hands at work we are aiming to get the mural on the librarys entrance wall in october we should have it finished by the end of august
3490401 i just want to give back to society in some way or the other there is nothing more satisfying than helping children and making them positively contribute to the neighborhood there is so much negativity all around and something like this will help them get in the positive realm of mind
3490402 we wanted to take the kids out and let them see for themselves what the neighborhood has the little treasures of fishtown are the parks we took them there and had them observe and make sketches they are so creative
3490403 the kid did not want to be a part of this however we took him and once there he got so involved in fact his was the best sketch he made a cute bumble bee and took part till the project concluded
3490404 i have been here for three sessions and i made this lady bug but my cousin 13 year old linda has already finished her stuff in a day
3490405 i love coming here and doing this i love painting and it will be great to see this on the wall
3490406 collaboration within a community inevitably acts as a semilla for changing social circumstances
3490407 our intention is to create projects that reclaim vital community spaces such as playgrounds parks and gardens back to its members our goal is break down the imaginary barriers that limit individuals and unite them by actively involving them in the process of physically transforming their own neighborhood exposing them to solutions and possibilities the vitality of any community can be found in the strengths and stability of its members and their ability to overcome the complexity of today
3490408 we hope that we can reach out to more and more people and they become a part of this group we want to plant the seeds of positive thinking via the medium of art
3490409 we hope that with events such as this we can help prevent bike accidents by raising awareness and getting qualaty safety equipment into the kids hands
3490410 the course is here to be a good time but its also a way for us to show the kids the appropriate way to be aware make safe turns and of course wear their helmets while riding
3490411 its a lot of fun like the course that we do at football practice but on a bike which makes it harder
3490412 we keep all of the information on file and then if a bike does get stolen weve got a great record of exactly what were looking for
3490413 my boyfriend has a really nice bike and as were locking up i sometimes see people eyeing it up its nice to know that if they do get stolen the police have a solid record to look for them
3490414 its just nice to know that if somebody takes my bike the police can help me find it so i can go riding again with my friends
3490415 we wanted the first year we did this to really remind everybody of quinnys spirit if you were sitting by the dugout you could hear quinnys voice in right field you didnt have to see who it was you knew it was him if it was one more run you needed or you were down quinny was always there to get everybody going
3490416 it just goes to show how well quinny was brought up and this year at the tournament it just wasnt the same without him there
3490417 as previously reported we do not believe this downward sales trend is driven by global national or regional economic factors or sales trends that are impacting ems providers like winland instead we believe our sales results primarily indicate market sector weaknesses specific to certain winland customers and to a lesser extent normal business fluctuations customer inventory rebalancing product lifecycles and the long sales cycles inherent in our business industry research supports our belief that ems growth in the foreseeable future is most likely among providers of high mix low volume electronics assemblies like winland where customers need a high level of proficiency in multiple value added engineering and manufacturing services quality standards component sourcing and program management
3490418 we believe the operational changes taking place will begin to favorably impact financial performance in the third and fourth quarters primarily due to an anticipated reduction in negative variances for labor and materials we expect that secondary benefits of these operational change initiatives will be improved on time delivery quality and customer retention some initiatives will be completed near the end of 2008 including advancements in manufacturing engineering and the establishment of formal lean six sigma training and implementation we believe that when fully implemented the benefits of all current operational initiatives will be sustainable as the company continues to build ems industry world class operations and business practices
3490419 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3490420 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3490421 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3490422 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3490423 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3490424 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3490425 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3490426 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3490427 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3490428 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3490429 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3490430 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3490431 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3490432 hes on the phone probably calling someone for help so i dont need to stop
3490433 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3490434 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3490435 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3490436 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3490437 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3490438 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3490439 a women who is abused by her husband is truly placed in a situation of double jeopardy regarding hiv infection
3490440 his sexual behavior outside of the marriage makes it more likely he is infected with the virus and his abusive behavior inside the marriage leaves her with little control over sex or sexual protection
3490441 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3490442 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3490443 while we are pleased with the progress of our ongoing technology development we are disappointed with our revenue performance for the first half of the year the lower than expected net revenues further emphasize the importance of our accelerated technology investments to execute on our strategy to be the first to market with a fully integrated end to end solution for clinical documentation coupled with superior services to that end we will continue to focus our attention on our technology development to drive internal efficiencies throughout our operations and grow the top line
3490444 y en esta ma ana los tres hermanos fueron fotografiados por la prensa cuando iban de camino a los estados
3490445 in spite of the very challenging economic headwinds our company faced we were able to expand gross margins and achieved flat operating loss compared to a year ago the substantial progress we have made is underscored by our new revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank we ended the quarter with an improved balance sheet as reflected by much lower debt and inventory levels we have significantly strengthened our portfolio of brands attracted an experienced management team renewed our focus on managing costs and solidified our capital structure these steps position us well for further financial and operational improvement while we are very encouraged by our accomplishments over the past twelve months our board and management team are intensely committed to translating these into improved equity value for our shareholders
3490446 our second quarter results were negatively impacted by the challenging economic environment and extraordinary softness at retail in spite of this hurdle tommy bahama maintained strong double digit growth and we were pleased with the sell through rates of products within our other brands as our retail partners focused on inventory reduction however reorders came in well below our expectations resulting in lower sales overall
3490447 to best manage our business through this more uncertain environment we continued to carefully review each of our brands with a particular focus on product quality customer deliveries and achieving our primary goal of profitable growth the positive response to our new product initiatives we received at the recent wsa show from our customers validates our ongoing investments in our brands and our ability to quickly react to changing demands in the market place we believe we have the right foundation in place and are very excited to see momentum building across all of our divisions and believe we will return to profitability and positive organic growth during the second half of 2008
3490448 in light of the unusual softness at retail this summer we are behind our original projections and do not anticipate that we will be able to close the gap sufficiently to meet our previously issued guidance of sales and operating income nonetheless we expect to achieve sales growth of approximately 5 10 for fiscal 2008 to return to profitability during the fourth quarter and to be approximately break even for the whole year on an operating basis
3490449 qu de latino es esto eso es all en europa
3490450 neither would be required to be in a car seat
3490451 the light will change to the hazard color the person coming straight will try and beat the light they both say they had the right of way

3490454 i seriously think you might have this every single thing its said thus far has been true for you
3490455 by making it appear indian with references to hindu scriptures and great poets people will not come to the truth this is a complete turn back from the real bible
3490456 i am sure this bible made in india and for indians will bring the word of god closer to millions of our people not only christians
3490457 work alone is your proper business never the fruits it may produce
3490458 it will take some time for the new bible to gain acceptance
3490459 stand in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where the good way is and walk in it then you will find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk in it
3490460 but the answer is not to create laws that try to legislate manners nor to suggest that its okay to kick kids out of school for sending a bullying message
3490461 even if nbc takes down one video theres likely to be 20 more sources that people can turn to
3490462 of course nbc has to have an antipiracy stance but what if viewers feel they arent offering a good enough medium to make the delay worthwhile
3490463 were working with the international olympic committee and other companies to ensure the take down of unauthorized content
3490464 until manufacturers discovered engine balancing increasing power meant increasing engine size which resulted in cars that created tremendous amounts of torque the power in the benz submerges you into the seat and driving it is like nothing youve ever experienced
3490465 i wanted to see what would happen if you put a really high powered engine in a chassis
3490466 the cramer comet is much more than one mans dream it encapsulates the enthusiasm and skill brought home by returning gis

3490470 the presidents of the european court human rights have granted interim relief to gary mckinnon for a period of two weeks until 28 august 2008 for the application to be heard before the full chamber
3490471 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3490472 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3490473 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3490474 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3490475 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3490476 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3490477 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3490478 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3490479 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3490480 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3490481 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3490482 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3490483 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3490484 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3490485 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3490486 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3490487 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3490488 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3490489 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3490490 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3490491 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3490492 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3490493 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3490494 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3490495 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3490496 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3490497 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3490498 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3490499 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3490500 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3490501 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3490502 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3490503 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3490504 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3490505 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3490506 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3490507 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3490508 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3490509 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3490510 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3490511 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3490512 what weve done is built away of patterning the essence of a video in a single pattern
3490513 the wretch concentrated all in self living shall forfeit fair renown and doubly dying shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung unwept unhonoured and unsung
3490514 we talk about the smog in beijing and if its as terrible in person as it looks on tv we get into the man on the street feel to the bog smog and he compares it to his time in turin we also talk about who the most interesting person hes met has been and turn it into a conversation about yak cheese craig sager and a lithuanian guy who looks just like my brother

3490538 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea
3490539 and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
3490540 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it
3490541 and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off
3490542 we successfully completed a reverse merger acquisition of cody resources inc a publicly quoted company on the otcbb we did this in order to reap the benefits of public ownership including the ability to enhance our visibility with customers and prospective customers and access to potential new avenues for capital formation collectively we believe this better positions chromadex to help us grow and expand to meet the significant and growing needs of customers in the second half of 2008 we will be focused on expanding our range of products and services to the market
3490543 i would encourage all retailers to find ways to move away from plastic bags or reuse plastic bags or better inform shoppers about the alternatives that are available
3490544 it is in our interest in canada to be ahead of this curve and to prepare for what is going to be one of the most important markets or commodities in the next few years we must move now and not wait until that happens and rather be in front of this important movement

3490549 strategic decisions made in late 2007 to restructure our direct and indirect sales teams to enhance our companys market penetration efforts have begun to take hold by refocusing our regional sales managers on nurturing significant sales opportunities with major and metropolitan agencies and concentrating our independent channel on winning contract deployments with small and mid sized agencies across the country we believe we have found the right formula for long term success
3490550 there are a number of key inflection points that we expect will trigger dynamic sales growth for icop in the second half of this year they include order flow from new customers in the international market place continued sales to major metro state and federal agencies redefinition of the competitive landscape new strategic partnerships with fortune 500 companies industry adoption of icop live and successful penetration into the school bus and transit markets

3490644 i know how badly i screwed up but i trusted you to be there for me even when i was wrong thats what love is about
3490645 i did maybe someday i will again that may take a while but im sure you can do it if you really really try
3490646 that was the most terrifying thing i have ever done you know how i say carson practices voodoo and he does its all guesswork but i could see i knew exactly what to do and i did it it scares the crap out of me i dont know what im turning into gods i dont want this
3490647 rodney if its tomorrow or a hundred years from now ill still love until you die and even after and if you ascend youd just better come back to me you hear
3490648 i had this brilliant idea but i dont know how much time i have left and i dont want to waste it id rather stay here with you
3490649 radek you should have known better did you learn nothing from sheppard and me messing with ancient machines always leads to trouble
3490650 yes well at least sheppard and i have the excuse that we thought it was only a game you and lorne knew there were real people involved
3490651 yes but the people were hungry and there was land in the south we just gave them some good ideas
3490652 i know that major but the principle is the same giving people advanced technology theyre not ready to handle
3490653 we didnt really sir just potato melon things and baskets really nice baskets
3490654 you should have known better major if dr weir hadnt shut you down i would have
3490655 no way we could have known although we should have realized that the ancients never gave a free gift without a booby trap attached
3490656 i beware of greeks even when they come bearing gifts
3490657 yeah right only in this case it should be geeks bearings gifts heh heh
3490658 calm down rodney not you the ancients pass the lube willya
3490659 for heavens sake no theyre not lovers at least i dont think so
3490660 i guess not every flyboy in the pegasus is lucky enough to have his own geek
3490661 i am not oh never mind okay im yours so were good right kiss and make up
3490662 of course were good mckay as long as you admit that you cheated and violated the prime directive
3490663 because youre not gonna need it tonight captain kirk prime directive my ass
3490664 wha no dont do that i absolutely refuse to have se i said no is your hearing imp yes yes right there again dont stop i said dont stop
3490665 i have to go get the lube youre the one who threw it across the room
3490666 ah yes more right there no no there yes there fuck me now wait wait give me a minute okay now push harder yes there more i said yes john john john
3490667 unless youre into the whole dom sub thing which i so am not you know me i feel vulnerable when im not in control so yes im a pushy bottom
3490668 the harper government has turned them into secrets and started censoring bits of them and now it seems they will disappear altogether
3490669 yeah us too if you could start off every game like that youd probably win a lot of games so its something to shoot for
3490670 it was good for us i think the best thing about it for us was when we got down there and scored a touchdown thats something weve had trouble with getting the ball in the end zone it seemed like we could always drive we just couldnt always really get it in i think scoring the touchdown was just as important as having all the plays and converting the third downs the touchdown was probably better than any of it
3490671 youre never really happy with where youre at but i definitely think were a lot better than we were last year at this point we feel pretty good about where were at but theres always things you want to improve on i know there are things that i want to improve on its about getting better every week
3490672 it is when you get the ball deep in your own territory its hard enough to make a drive and get out at least far enough that when you switch field position you can at least go down there and score some points when you start adding penalties and sacks that really backs you up once you get inside your own 10 that kind of limits the things that you can do you dont want to turn the ball over and you dont want to risk getting a safety we just need to keep the field position in our favor
3490673 the only way to win them over is to get out there play well win football games and prove to them that youre somebody they can count on you know were not quite as old as we used to be ive got a first class seat that tells you how young we are
3490674 you know were getting there we hadnt really had a day where we were like man that didnt look good weve gotten better every day weve learned new things every day hes offensive coordinator chan gailey put us in position to make plays thats his whole thing he wants to get us some one on ones whether it be rb larry johnson with a safety or a receiver is one on one with a db thats all you can ask for in football hes getting us in those positions were getting better at making those plays
3490675 its going really well wr will franklin has had a great camp he was somebody that we were counting on to really step up and have a big camp for us hes our starting slot right now he came out last week and made the big catch on third and long wr dwayne bowe is going into his second year and obviously hes our go to guy its just a matter of all of us getting on the same page
3490676 hes come back great hes obviously put in the work to get back to where he needs to be hes had a great camp as far as us sitting down and talking about injuries no
3490677 obviously my rookie year was just kind of a blur and last year with hard knocks and battling for a position you cant really take hold and grasp it when the head coach and everyone is on your side and they say its your job and they dont go out and draft a quarterback they dont even go out and try to get a veteran it kind of gives you confidence and everybody knows you play a lot better when youre confident im confident in our new offense confident in our players and im confident that were going to be a lot better football team than people give us credit for
3490678 theyve been great the whole thing is they wanted them all to play together the whole camp unfortunately that wasnt possible t brandon albert got hurt t herb taylor has really stepped in there and had a really good camp as much as we talk about them making things easier for us theyve made things easier for the offensive line as well theyve really showed up and a bunch of young guys have stepped up and have had great camps i feel very confident just standing back there going through my reads and not worrying about getting hit
3490679 you have to step into the huddle feeling that way thats your job thats what everybodys looking for you to do with every snap in practice every snap in the game i feel it more and more but you can feel like its completely yours until you go out there and earn it you can do as much as you want during practice and preseason but we just have to wait for the regular season to get here and go from there
3490680 as i said you have to feel like its your huddle when you step in there and call the play you have to know what the right tackle is doing left tackle who theyre going to if a guy has a question about a route you have to tell him especially with us being as young as we are stepping into the huddle feeling like its your huddle is definitely different than stepping in feeling like its your team
3490681 i would say out of 16 plays we probably had seven or eight that we had the ability to change it so thats eight more than we had all of last season combined
3490682 it just kind of makes sense if you go up there and they have eight guys in the box and you only have seven people to block them it doesnt make a whole lot of sense to run the football thats where chan getting us into one on ones comes into play you know checking to the pass if theyre playing cover two zone run the ball at them thats your best chance its just kind of stuff that makes sense
3490683 the opening menu has about probably 45 minutes or maybe half an hours worth of dialogue just talking about the eddas in the story so you can just watch it circling the cyberspace tree and learn about the game
3490684 first play through is probably around fifteen hours i guess it depends

3490865 context of any transaction so long as that transaction is not directly dictated by the state the word has no content of its own because it is defined simply and by reasons of politics by what it is not the market is the nonstate and thus it can do everything the state can do but with none of the procedures or rules or limitations it is a disembodied decision maker a maxwells demon who somehow and without effort balances and reflects the preferences of everyone participating in economic decisions it can be these things precisely because it is nothing at all

3490870 i just love the attention i get when i wear a really tight top
3490871 were going to need to have our first ever cage match right here on september 7th
3490872 but not like rene van der gijp who does motivational speeches for big rooms full of people i couldnt do that im too shy for that
3490873 yeah i played central defender in those days i was tall and strong i didnt mind physical challenges and was a good header and i was slow so they couldnt use me anywhere else i guess
3490874 but still ajax also needs lower teams i guess to compete in different competitions i dont think i was destined for the big job in those days but things changed when my youth coach suddenly put me in as central striker i started to score goals a lot and that changed everything
3490875 i was never really highly talented like van basten or vanenburg but i was pretty aloof and strong and tall i knew how to hold my own and to be honest scoring in an ajax team is always easier than in say sparta or telstar i always played with good players that helps
3490876 ruud geels and ray clarke had just left ajax and tonnie blanker was the chosen one for the striker position but he didnt make it so ajax signed piet hamberg he was a bit injured when he came so leo used me as striker in the season warm up i scored and kept scoring and since then i stayed in the team i was only 17 years old i do remember i made my debut in the season before against sparta but i cant remember a single thing from that match only that i was extremely nervous ajax won 4 3
3490877 i played with jesper olsen on the left of me and tcheu la ling on the right a strikers dream with these two scoring was easy i was a huge ling fan man that guy was insanely good what an elegance and style mostly brilliant sometimes horrible he could do what i couldnt even do in my dreams and a very nice guy too
3490878 we trained constantly on those crosses at the near post until you got sick of it but it worked nine out of ten times i only had to tap the ball in i remember the older players like arnesen and lerby and piet schrijvers would yell at me for everything i did wrong i remember thinking i couldnt do anything right it must have worked but i do feel they could have done it in a nicer way it was a tough learning process
3490879 i knew him from his feyenoord days but never realized how good he was man he was smart he was a good coach too tough but friendly and johan cruyff came back in the winter break and when he came everything clicked we were unstoppable with arnesen lerby olsen cruyff and jansen it was easy for me i couldnt fail and then we had some talents coming up like vanenburg and rijkaard kurt linder was our coach but he only nagged johan determined everything already in those days
3490880 the expectations after my first season were huge i was only 19 years old and had made my debut in oranje as well the pressure was immense and i started to cramp up and choke marco was pushed as my successor although we also played together we could play well together but the club wanted me to move on johnny bosman was also explicitly knocking on the door and ton harmsen the club chairman i loathed pushed me out
3490881 italy wasnt as open as it is today and pisa really wanted me i could make a lot of money there and my manager really pushed that move only krol jan peters and michel van der korput played in italy and somehow i wanted to play there too the city was totally crazy when the club presented me i looked behind me at the airport because i thought maradona had arrived they thought i was a world class player which i wasnt i was a dependent player if you know what i mean
3490882 it was horrible i was only 20 years old and i needed good players to allow me to do my job but i was most of the times the only lone striker and wed be in training camps for weeks my girl friend hated life in italy we also hardly ever got paid in time
3490883 in the serie b pisa dared to play offensive and i scored a lot i became a popular player in pisa we promoted directly again and the next season in the serie a was a relative success
3490884 i still had a three year deal with torino and i loved that club but life in holland was better for my young family kiefts son robin was born in torino so i moved back
3490885 we started well and we never stopped we had a great team i became the dutch top scorer again with 29 goals and i secured my spot in the dutch team
3490886 sure at the time it was frustrating to be honest you dont look at the team you only focus on yourself i wanted to play period later on i learned to accept that marco was the better player much better i can see that but i didnt want to give up that spot without a fight whenever i came on i gave it my all
3490887 that 1988 tournament was just great wonderful experience we were a real team very hungry and eager i was also part of the wc1990 squad and the ec1992 squad but the chemistry wasnt there those teams were teams of spoiled stars who would win the title with one finger in the nose in sweden 1992 it seemed as if we were on a holiday together i cant even remember a thing from that tournament the best players dont always win the title you know you need more by the way i though the 1998 squad was the better team compared to 1988
3490888 i liked romario he was a good seed he liked me too because id pass the ball to him whenever he was in the better position i didnt care who scored him or me but some other players didnt like him and tried to ignore him i even scored 21 goals that season so i wasnt too unhappy overall
3490889 i had some issues with certain players at psv some thought they were the big stars suddenly the vibe wasnt good bordeaux really wanted to sign me so i thought why not but after a couple of months the general manager ended up in prison for fraud and the club was practically bankrupt we didnt get our pay and i took the used jerseys home to wash them for the next week insane psv asked me back when the issues there were resolved so i went back to eindhoven
3490890 a wonderful man i really clicked with him a sweet man and a great coach uncomplicated but smart in a motivational sense youd break through a brick wall for him
3490891 two months later oranje played another friendly and i was surprised to get an invite as normal
3490892 aad de mos was psvs coach and i thought he was a bit of a fake his motivational and interpersonal stuff was just not truthful you know he acted more than he was himself i hated that so when my body didnt cooperate and things at psv were a bit iffy i decided to throw the towel feyenoord and ajax wanted to sign me as pinch hitter which i thought was quite something but it was over and done with my body and mind didnt want to go on anymore i quit my last game was volendam away a pathetic end really
3490893 i dont see marco van basten as my rival or my enemy or something if he wasnt there would i have had a better career i dont know maybe i would have played longer at ajax but then again my italy period was wonderful i learned a lot there and i was successful at psv
3490894 well i will continue with that but i will also enlist in the trainer coach studies next season i will do my apprentice ship at the oranje under 19 year olds

3490910 we found this meeting very positive and it allowed the families to ask questions which we answered
3490911 we reassured the family that we are taking this investigation seriously this inquiry will be handled with integrity impartiality and with rigour
3490912 the advantage of a public inquiry is that it will look for the motives that feed this hatred of the police system
3490913 the other advantage of a public inquiry is that we will be able to analyze the intervention methods of police
3490914 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual

3490928 i would rather lose a political campaign for doing something thats right than not do anything
3490929 we know that any time the price goes up children or young adults are sensitive to the price which means that in the long run they delay smoking also adults are sensitive to prices we know that gets us a reduction
3490930 its time for an increase its been a long time
3490931 having gold medal experience is key especially with this young team i have to help them understand what to expect as we get closer to reaching the goal of playing in the medal rounds
3490932 for me personally my most treasured memory for the 2004 summer olympics was the opening ceremony in athens it was amazing to see all those athletes on the same field at the same time competing for one glorious opportunity to see those flags being risen is great
3490933 i put them both neck and neck but its hard to say the nba championship is more special because this is representing your country not just the team this is about fighting for our country
3490934 losing at the 2004 olympics was obviously a shock to everybody thats why the word redemption is out there the one thing thats different with this team is that our chemistry is better in the last couple years weve been able to play in different tournaments and gain that chemistry
3490935 with our team as it is with any team its about creating opportunities for whoever is open thats what i do on the lakers and thats what lebron james does in cleveland it will be no different with this team

3490939 ive seen a sufficient amount of video footage and ive read enough information to know that wisla are a very good footballing side who know how to play and are very much organised
3490940 i worry that as theyre a little known team they may be under rated but we know enough of them to know that a hard knockout round awaits us
3490941 i know the quality of some players such as attacker pawel brozek or his twin brother pitor
3490942 they have important midfielders such as cantoro and sobolewski and their partners at left centre back its a good team well need to run and play hard to break them down
3490943 if youre on vacation near barcelona come on down to the camp nou its only a moment away by car
3490944 they can stay for dinner then watch the game there are lots of good reasons to come to the stadium well do our utmost to ensure that people can enjoy the game and spend their time well
3490945 its a special game im a bit agitated by the importance of this match i wont be able to live out this feelings until tomorrow
3490946 i am not thinking about signing players at the moment because they cannot play against liege tomorrow i am only concentrating on this game
3490947 and i have not needed to contact the owners because they cannot help with the preparation for this match i prefer not to say anything else
3490948 i have not been distracted i have been focusing on this game and getting to the champions league group stages
3490949 there is no more pressure than in previous seasons we all know how important it is to get past this qualifying round
3490950 everyone knows how important the champions league is for us we must play well
3490951 we know standard are a good team especially at home
3490952 every club must be aware of the quality of your opponents
3490953 you must be really focused for every game you cannot change things once you have made a mistake
3490954 taboo why blacks athletes dominate sports and why we are afraid to talk about it
3490955 when stripped of the drug factor what appears in the history books as a decades long duel between european and african american female sprinters has been a fraud black female sprinters are a cut above much like their male counterparts marion jones is the indisputable top female sprinter the epitome of an elite athlete gifted with the explosive speed and jumping ability that mark the prototypical athlete with west african ancestry although she now trains feverishly jones is as close to being a born athlete as exists in sprinting
3490956 they had been putting it all out on the line for a week and im sure they were wondering if they could turn it up a notch but the bottom line is they came through with flying colors
3490957 we didnt see any sort of let down and we were very proud of how they finished up practice number two on monday going full speed right to the end
3490958 now that the players know what theyre supposed to be doing we want to see who can line up during a drill and do it better than the practice before the mental process is no longer overwhelming to them and now they can just get on the field and perform what theyve learned when the ball is snapped
3490959 we wanted to give the younger guys about a dozen live snaps
3490960 most of them wont see time in a game this year it gave the whole team something to get excited about and the older players really enjoyed watching the younger guys go at it we saw some good things on both sides of the ball

3490962 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy

3491001 china has restricted the export of fireworks from july through to the end of august so there have been a few problems with delayed shipments and a few items havent been available
3491002 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3491003 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3491004 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3491005 scanworks is powerful in that it can access automate and analyze embedded instrumentation such as the voltage margining embedded in these devices
3491006 several of our customers requested we seek scanworks support now engineers can use our tools during design and scanworks throughout the product lifecycle including design manufacturing and field service
3491007 maxim now supplies a family of devices which can margin voltages and measure system current temperature and voltage variations storing the results
3491008 these capabilities are essential for systems with high reliability requirements such as telecom systems servers and storage
3491009 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3491010 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3491011 the arrow technical solutions forums are designed to provide real world solutions to complex engineering designs with sessions that are much more interactive than standard seminars
3491012 for better or worse these are the olympics undoubtedly because it would be considered impolitic to embarrass the chinese after they went to such great expense to throw the world this lavish party
3491013 are the chinese underage or like other gymnasts from other countries through the years strategically undernourished which strikes me as worse than forging a few documents in the grand scheme of things
3491014 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3491015 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3491016 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3491017 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3491018 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3491019 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3491020 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3491021 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3491022 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3491023 sometimes the cause and effect is difficult to define it s a self perpetuating vicious circle going on where oil falls strengthens the dollar then the strengthening dollar forces oil down more
3491024 of all the housemates he wants to be here the least and when someone does feel that way it makes it harder to get on with them in the house
3491025 she doesnt actually say some things she makes you feel uncomfortable with the way she is acting its all a game she creates rows i think
3491026 i just dont really agree with the way he stuart handles things being nasty and stirring up little comments
3491027 i dont think he deserves to be here the way he keeps going on about how he wants to go home
3491028 i always hide in the basement but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3491029 there were so many fragments i believe they use that kind of ammunition to hit infantry but they showered it on our heads
3491030 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3491031 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3491032 die olympischen spiele sind f r uns wie ein laufsteg
3491033 unsere k ufer erwarten mehr als nur sportperformance sie wollen auch mode und design
3491034 unser ziel ist es nicht in der k rzesten zeit der gr te zu sein unser ziel ist es die begehrteste marke zu werden
3491035 every experience god gives us every person he puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for the future that only he can see
3491036 due to the recent rain that we have received it is now safe for the citizens of piedmont to resume with outdoor watering and burning
3491037 our residents were very understanding with the recent ban and we would like to thank them for their cooperation
3491038 i dont think he has any regard for our legal system i dont think he has any regard for our laws he does what he wants to do
3491039 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3491040 finance directors are not as short sighted as some people may think so the answer is to take more time finding out the real problems the customer is facing right now and providing a solution which will solve these specific problems dont just think you can offer the same old thing that might have been appropriate in a period of growth and when cash was not such an issue
3491041 prospecting activity during a downturn in the economy should actually increase partly because there are less opportunities around and partly because they will benefit from the lower activity of their competitors
3491042 i always advise businesses to ask themselves one simple question if you were in your prospects shoes would you go for it if the answer is no then you need find a proposition where the answer would be yes
3491043 for a long time google has led a largely blissful existence fostering a widespread perception sometimes in direct contradiction to the facts that it can do no wrong yet the companys controversial android mobile platform venture threatens to seriously dent this notion at least with some of the people it needs most
3491044 as it readies its long anticipated open mobile os for public release google is behaving in a way that threatens to permanently taint its relationship with many android developers the companys actions including restricting access to key development tools and allegedly treading on open source principles have created if not a full fledged revolt at least a sense of disappointment and disillusionment among many in the tightly knit android development community which numbers perhaps 2 000 according to an estimate by androidguys an independent android blog site some developers have threatened to shift their attention to other mobile platforms

3491054 the u s has been put in an impossible position
3491055 the u s likes georgia george bush has been supporting the government but they re not going to go to war with russia over little georgia the u s needs russia for bigger games
3491056 russia has been in control of these regions keeping the peace and georgia wants those regions back and has a perfect international right
3491057 but the local people don t want to go back to georgia
3491058 it would be very interesting to see if there is a change of force posture and content of training in response to all of this
3491059 we have been clear with taiwan that u s support is not carte blanche to go to war with china
3491060 the irony is that this proves georgia is both unfit for nato membership and desperately needs it at the same time
3491061 the russians are going to want to keep abkhazia and south ossetia largely because they don t want georgia to join nato
3491062 if russia feels it can just intervene with no effort at multilateralism then that s very dangerous for ukraine
3491063 this was a ridiculous military adventure by saakashvili that was met by a response that was pretty predictable
3491064 when you muck around with the russians they re like the schoolyard bully
3491065 they re not going to give you tit for tat they re going to overwhelm you and batter you
3491066 we ve basically put ourselves in an impossible situation where we have no maneuverability
3491067 and again russia is feeling its oats flexing its muscles
3491068 speaker pelosi and the democrats said they had a commonsense energy plan when gas was 2 10 a gallon and then last year they voted on an energy bill that did not mention exploration but did mention changing light bulbs hundreds of times now gas prices have doubled where is their plan
3491069 the democrats solution is to push gimmickry and call it an energy bill but the republican plan is for solar wind coal to liquid ocs conservation and new technologies we need an up or down vote weve done all we can and now its up to you the american people this is the peoples house and you need to call your member of congress and demand the speaker call the house back in session
3491070 why wont the speaker of the house allow the peoples elected representatives a vote
3491071 democrats said they had an energy plan at 2 10 a gallon prices are now outrageous
3491072 high energy prices significantly undermine our way of life and our national security i intend to be here on this floor until the job is done
3491073 the article of clothing that she is trying to pull off as a dress is actually a top it was purchased at one of our retail stores
3491074 we have a dress code here if you are coming here to shop today and you come in wearing a top with no pants then we are going to ask you to leave
3491075 i was walking through and 10 minutes after i was there the security guard approached me asked me to step aside made me completely do a turn around while he stared me up and down and then asked me to leave because my outfit was too provocative and
3491076 girls are always buying shirts as dresses it depends really on your height whether you can pull it off
3491077 on our doors we clearly have posted no shoes no shirt no service
3491078 well i guess im going to have to add no pants to that
3491079 ha sido bueno ver que hemos marcado much simos goles
3491080 ha sido bueno ver que hemos marcado much simos goles el entendimiento entre robbie keane y fernando torres en la pretemporada ha sido una de las preguntas que se me plantearon y me ha parecido que ha estado muy bien
3491081 sabemos que cuando juegan en casa son muy dif ciles con lo que necesitamos estar listos y creo que mentalmente los jugadores est n preparados
3491082 si ganamos quiz esto nos sirva de empuj n para el partido de liga
3491083 hacerlo lo mejor posible desde el principio de la temporada
3491084 no est en posici n de organizar una sede segura en georgia ni jugar en una sede alternativa
3491085 the danger in this situation if i can be very blunt about it is that you say there have been 60 years of failure of negotiation and therefore its always going to fail whereas actually sometimes things arent like that and to be fair to this palestinian leadership as i keep emphasizing theyre living with the legacy of a certain type of politics and you dont escape from that immediately
3491086 we do not expect blairs role to be fair in any issue relating to the palestinian israeli conflict or any other arab related cause
3491087 while their homes farms and properties are inhabited by jewish immigrants who arrived in palestine from around the globe

3491094 la verdad que me siento bien me he esforzado y entregado pero a lo mejor no es tanto que en lo personal est fallando simplemente que el profe est buscando ajustes y bueno ya le toc al gaucho pero hay que tomarlo con tranquilidad
3491095 lo est haciendo bien xavier b ez yo estoy tranquilo y la competencia que hay en un grupo hace crecer a cualquier futbolista

3491099 importa m s lo que hagamos nosotros por eso estamos entrenando defensiva y ofensivamente para sabe qu hacer contra morelia ellos tienen jugadores buenos pero lo m s importante es lo que hagamos nosotros vamos a ir a morelia a tratar de hacer un buen partido

3491136 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3491137 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3491138 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3491139 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3491143 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 y la declaraci n de las naciones unidas esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3491144 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3491145 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3491146 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

3491148 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

3491150 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3491151 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3491152 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3491153 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3491154 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3491155 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3491156 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3491157 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3491158 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3491159 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3491160 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3491161 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3491162 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3491163 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3491164 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3491165 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3491166 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3491167 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3491168 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3491169 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3491186 i was looking back over the past years of the pma and all the things we asked agencies to do and it occurred to me it was a good time to step back and assess how well the human capital initiative was doing across agencies
3491187 what i was particularly interested in doing is figuring out if check marks agencies had earned earlier on could be substantiated we said were going to spend the entire year re validating every check mark on their score card
3491188 if youre green it might mean i wanted to hire engineers to fill a critical need and you look back and say i met my need
3491189 agencies that went from green to yellow still can earn back their check marks
3491190 we need to have as much transparency as possible in the grading process some of the data points arent uniformly available we dont have information on quality of hires the true time to hire but that doesnt take away from the importance of this kind of system
3491191 whether or not the score card continues to exist we wanted to set a process where agencies could continue to work on these initiatives
3491192 that was my reason for wanting to start this process now theres a lot of interest to continue this new way of managing things in the government will i brief the new president if he calls me up and asks sure but he hasnt done that yet

3491197 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

3491227 the footage and photos from yesterday will demonstrate loudly to officials at the holy see and indeed the holy father himself that this community has a flawed understanding of loyalty and little or no understanding of communion in the church
3491228 we are not paying enough attention to test cricket which is the genuine form of the game
3491229 we have to get our priorities right in the odis a spinner cannot bowl more than ten overs and it is only four in a twenty20 game the entire approach of a spinner changes in a test the field placings are completely different you need to see off spells without being negative you need to prepare mentally and tactically
3491230 when the entire team gets together you sit down and chart out a strategy you anticipate different situations have a game plan you discuss each bowler about how you would counter them as a pack
3491231 they did not use their feet enough they should have stepped out more often

3491255 obviously as were coming to xbox live for the first time it would be nice to be prominent and we could just get lost in the morass of arcade conversions
3491256 but its also the bread and butter for those companies it may not be huge sales but that thousand or so per month they are selling is a trickle of income and its just going to get sliced off

3491262 when theres a high concentration of high end sales theres an overly optimistic result without providing clear explanations about whats happening
3491263 ive run the data with and without those sales and the impact on the average price was pronounced on the median price it was so minimal that it shows there are other high priced closings
3491264 the concentration of the high number of closings in these notable high end properties are widening the spread between the average sale prices and median sale prices
3491265 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game

3491379 dass meine neigungen eher bei fdp und gr nen liegen habe ich oft genug gesagt aber das ndert nichts daran dass die spd nicht behaupten kann sie h tte keine alternative dazu ihre menschen in einen wortbruch zu f hren
3491380 they were retreating it wasnt panic but they were trying to leave one by one not in groups
3491381 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3491382 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3491383 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3491384 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3491385 georgias ill wishers are well aware that georgia is impossible to defeat when it is united and when it has world support
3491386 just trying to get better prepared for some of the things going forward thats all a little more continuity
3491387 our goal as a team right now is to be 1 0
3491388 well worry about two after that our target right now is to prepare for the first game after that well go from there
3491389 id rather lose with brett favre than win with aaron rodgers
3491390 you delayed the process arbitrarily just because you wanted to send another notice im telling you quit stalling go get the money
3491391 the purpose was to incentivise recycling so your actions have caused a slowdown in creating the culture of people who are trying to recycle their goods thats really the negative impact of this the money is secondary to that
3491392 raytheon is proud of its record of employee relations and believes there is no merit to these claims
3491393 what the hell am i doing i am not cut out for this
3491394 what if i was picked for grave sick for days aged to be sick with aids would you listen to my story that i swear is touching or just blank stare because youre scared to touch me
3491395 by the way u have 3 lines to explain what makes u different
3491396 this update contains several improvements to enhance stability and performance
3491397 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
3491398 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
3491399 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
3491400 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
3491401 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
3491402 the key is choice and google has taken away that choice and is developing android like every other piece of closed software
3491403 rather than trying to push yet another platform google ought to be bringing the market together and building applications which is where theyre going to make their money
3491404 the developer discontent is just part of what has turned out to be a flawed strategy
3491405 its the very same reason why apple didnt do third party developers first and thats to assure the process and the program and the quality thats initially being offered
3491406 the community must not forget that google is dealing with partners in the cell phone industry and they certainly have a reputation of a closed source tight lipped mentality
3491407 the community can cry foul if google releases the newest sdk to developers a week before handsets hit the stores but as far as i have heard that is far from the truth
3491408 within the next six months symbian and android will combine into a single open source os
3491409 on the other hand it would be much easier to do now than to tackle it in the future when developers are that much farther down the road
3491410 to tie symbian and android together would require an awful lot of heavy lifting between google and nokia and to do that kind of an agreement would be problematic
3491411 it would have been easier while symbian was small and independent but now that symbian is basically a subsidiary of nokia its going to be pretty difficult
3491412 if you develop for apple youve got a ready market
3491413 if you develop for android its a crapshoot because theres no assurance that the android platform is even going to sell
3491414 while google does simple well this is googles first device as opposed to apple which clearly has been doing devices for a while
3491415 apple is treating developers terribly and really undermining the community
3491416 the fact that applications have to go through the itunes store in order to be distributed really shows how much control apple has over the entire os
3491417 at the end of the day developers want to make money
3491418 so theyre going to develop on a platform and put resources on a platform that will make them money
3491419 undoubtedly some developers have written android off and will never return
3491420 lots arent paying a darn bit of attention to the whole mess because there arent any devices ready yet
3491421 dear friends i want to thank you so much for your open ears and all the amazingly thoughtful comments and feedback you have shared with me since the initial posting of the three advance tracks from my pending album
3491422 special thanks to everybody who has taken the time to write personally i really appreciate the kind words and encouragement more than you know
3491423 the best possible news is that all this life that happened along the way has only helped allow
3491424 today this album project one that now seems like a lifes work is about 85 complete
3491425 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not
3491426 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3491427 but what i told the as is i want to be productive in the middle of the lineup again i want to swing the bat for you guys again im hopeful ill be able to do both
3491428 the industry believed that you were just going to see the home depots of the world the furniture stores the granite counter tops are us type retailers get hurt they are surprised to see how quickly it spread to other types of retailers
3491429 business is booming it will be very robust for us this year and for sometime into the future
3491430 landlords are more open to the tenants we bring them instead of raising objections right now many of them are just happy to see the spaces get filled as long as the tenant isnt hurting any of the other tenants they have
3491431 the economic climate is bad and we see a lot of additional sites being added to the portfolio
3491432 people dont have discretionary income and they are severely hurt by the impact the housing market downturn has had
3491433 the stores that are more susceptible to slowdowns in the economy are the stores announcing closings
3491434 consumers have less discretionary income right now so non essential goods such as clothing are struggling with sales thus some clothing retailers have to close stores
3491435 the slowing economy has clearly translated into companies more cautious outlook for the balance of the year
3491436 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench
3491437 because i know what it is like to live without human rights where human life is accorded no inherent value
3491438 mccains advisers have said that he will not fight to soften the republican platform on abortion and mccain himself has said that it would be
3491439 it is difficult to argue that the courts opinion is not constitutionally suspect
3491440 we tried to get as many co sponsors as we could and we postured the thing as anti vigilante violence
3491441 we argued that even if you oppose abortion you should not condone these actions
3491442 there were a number of very anti choice senators who voted for face
3491443 se or fiscal cu l es su compromiso con la verdad
3491444 al respecto no he recibido m s que dilaciones y la total ausencia de acciones eficaces por parte de su oficina
3491445 de toda esta toma del poder pol tico regional lo que m s me preocupa y entristece doctor iguar n es lo que deben estar sintiendo y pensando las v ctimas al conocer mediante respuesta de su entidad que en la mayor a de investigaciones por los cr menes en los municipios escenario de los pactos entre pol ticos y paramilitares entre los a os 1999 y 2006 casi todas han terminado en inhibitorios o 7 a os despu s siguen estando en pr ctica de pruebas cu l es el compromiso de su administraci n con la verdad
3491446 majorities support all of the five potential federal initiatives tested
3491447 house republicans have remained on the floor speaking directly to the chorus of americans filling the house visitors gallery requesting that speaker pelosi reconvene the house and allow a vote on comprehensive common sense approach to reducing the price of energy
3491448 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3491449 i am not gay and i have never been gay
3491450 im not going to honour those questions with an answer
3491451 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
3491452 you cant begin to imagine how sorry i am that i got caught and she wasnt even that good in bed
3491453 he pokes his head out occasionally but thats about it
3491454 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3491455 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3491456 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3491457 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3491458 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3491459 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3491460 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3491461 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
3491462 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
3491463 ive had more people tell me they say its a kids body but it has a 70 year old dude inside
3491464 i think its so much you can do on the guitar
3491465 because i got more inspiration i got more sadness in me
3491466 we are helping acciona with tatanka whose name is inspired by the lakota indian tribal word for the buffalo that once roamed the midwest to charge into the american wind industry with a major project in the best wind farming area of the united states
3491467 a catcher and his body are like the outlaw and his horse hes got to ride that nag till it drops
3491468 let the presidential candidates gov sonny perdue and other politicos sing the glories of homegrown resources and energy independence let al gore and leonardo dicaprio make all the movies they want about global warming hardly anyone is buying it
3491469 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
3491470 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program theyre 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
3491471 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
3491472 the cost of new energy is confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
3491473 banks like morgan stanley and merrill lynch are playing musical chairs
3491474 why are they doing this they want to keep the talent
3491475 the timing of this partnership is significant coming as it does when skyrocketing fuel prices are having a tremendous economic impact on the airline industry this partnership clearly demonstrates that major players have confidence in our it solutions to reduce costs and increase revenue
3491476 skychain has been built for the air cargo business of today and the changing dynamics of the foreseeable future we are confident skychain will have a significant and positive impact on our customers financial bottom line and make waves in the air cargo industry
3491477 srilankan cargo is recognised today as one of the most energetic technologically advanced and cost efficient freight operators in south asia in our business timing is everything this is why we are working with mercator which has a proven track record for development implementation and innovation to fulfill an ever increasing list of customer demands
3491478 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3491479 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3491480 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3491481 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3491482 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3491483 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3491484 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3491485 there are so many people here that have got a head like an oil well it isnt empty yet and theyre anxious to work so im trying to suck the oil and gas out
3491486 i grew up in the depression and people in the depression have been conserving all along
3491487 if you arent in the room lights off if somebody walks in then it will come on automatically by itself
3491488 its probably one of the most energy efficient retirement communities in the country certainly the most that ive ever seen
3491489 theres admiral mooney jack brown coach royal always throws his support to all our initiatives
3491490 this is an important election for all americans but for those involved in agriculture the differences between the candidates is are huge
3491491 we think its important to show our support for the candidate who listens to farmers and understands what it will take to make rural america prosper
3491492 the dangerous nature of a ba aa and iberia alliance and why it should be blocked
3491493 has not significantly increased competition on uk london us routes
3491494 to ensure the continuity of the company and secure around 3 000 job positions
3491495 his failure in virtually every category that can be measured
3491496 we have to maximize our earnings during this difficult period which is why we are moving our capacity however while we are reducing services on some routes we will continue to maintain the integrity of our network reshaping it where necessary to ensure we fly aircraft to where we can cover our costs and also make some money
3491497 it is very doubtful that mr gilberts post fight sample contains methamphetamine
3491498 it is a generally known fact that printing was discovered in haarlem by our townsman laurens janszoon coster
3491499 i was watching the opening ceremony beautiful as it was when i heard china claiming the invention of the art of printing for itself as mayor of haarlem i could not leave it there hence the letter
3491500 there is no question nevada is a low taxed state
3491501 it is our low tax burden that causes people to create business in this state and businesses to relocate in this state
3491502 there is nothing negative about a name like coca cola or mcdonalds today in the 1970s maybe it was
3491503 he became cold to me and when his phone rang he would walk out to answer it
3491504 i tried to have a conversation with him and he told me the name and address unconsciously
3491505 im telling you nick if you just pulled over at that gas station and asked for directions wed already be there
3491506 were not lost were just a little behind thats all
3491507 uh huh thats all dont mind me im just going to shut this off
3491508 that was rascal flatts hes like an awesome country singer
3491509 hes giving me a headache now lets figure out how to get to the scene so i can go home and take a nice long nap
3491510 ha ha no we didnt hit anything you hit something
3491511 im hungry i usually carry a chocolate bar in here
3491512 we should get walking maybe back to the gas station
3491513 that gas station is at least two miles maybe three
3491514 are you kidding it could be a killed or or
3491515 did you didnt know you could do x in javascript
3491516 nearly ideal growing season weather across much of the corn belt since late june has supported crop development and increased yield prospects
3491517 even with the late planting yields are jumping to 155 bushels per acre
3491518 us ending stocks remain sufficiently large to discourage renewed bullish momentum
3491519 the primary drivers for these revisions are customer volumes overall weak global equity markets and weak advisory and underwriting revenues
3491520 recent weakness in terms of equity underwriting equities trading and private equity or equities in general is hitting goldman at its core strength
3491521 the result is likely to be weaker than expected earnings which should show that goldman is not immune to capital market pressures
3491522 at the moment the light at the end of the tunnel is very dim near term a turnround in the companys earnings is not in prospect
3491523 somos los hombres huecos somos los hombres rellenos apoyados uno en otro la mollera llena de paja ay nuestras voces resecas cuando susurramos juntos son tranquilas y sin significado
3491524 manso t mesis que ya no transporta colillas de cigarro ni otras huellas de noches de verano las ninfas se marcharon
3491525 the hyperion power module was originally conceived to provide clean affordable power for remote industrial applications such as oil sands operations
3491526 yet the initial enthusiasm has been from those needing reliable electricity for communities the big question for the 21st century is how do we provide safe energy to those who need it indeed those developing nations who demand it without contributing to climate change todays safer proliferation resistant nuclear power technology is the answer but its not feasible for every community to be tied to a large nuclear power plant some communities those that need power for just the most basic humanitarian infrastructure such as clean water production for household use and irrigation are too remote for conventional nuclear power this is where the hyperion power module a safe secure transportable power generator can help
3491527 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3491528 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil
3491529 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3491530 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3491531 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3491532 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3491533 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3491534 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3491535 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3491536 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3491537 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3491538 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3491539 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3491540 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum
3491541 there have been a lot of rumours flying around but i am not going anywhere and i dont anticipate going anywhere
3491542 there is a job to do here and i am looking forward to it
3491543 there is speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i joined the club but from my own point of view i am very focused on what i am about and what i aim to achieve here and that means success on the pitch
3491544 nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club nor has my relationship with garry cook and his team we get on really well and continue to speak on a daily basis
3491545 i am the guy that makes the decisions in relation to the football and they make the decisions in relation to the running of the club
3491546 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3491547 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3491548 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years
3491549 were a bit dizzy with it were just getting so many conflicting messages i think most supporters are worried that the impact on the club is going to be very negative
3491550 i dont see a great deal of positives at the moment
3491551 if hes been out shopping he can just take 15 minutes to talk to any representative of the press and give them a story to take back to the fans in manchester
3491552 ele se tornou frio comigo e quando seu telefone tocava ele sa a para a rua para atender
3491553 sure lets say there is a group of people working on something you may have a top down approach when the manager or the head of the group implies structure in the project management case its most likely a work breakdown structure wbs the project manager spends some time at the beginning of the project and designs a wbs that will stay throughout the project it will probably be extended a little bit made more detailed but there is little chance that the wbs will be changed dramatically because that is very hard to do it would require the project manager to re plan everything himself and thats a lot of hassle woodlywonderworks conversely the way emerging structures work in project management is like this if different parts of the organization or different members of the team designed a structure that works for them then when they collaborate and apply collective intelligence they start to align those structures together
3491554 there is a good metaphor the agile approach to doing software design the traditional approach to software design is to design everything upfront people who use agile methods often design the parts align them and then let the softwares bigger design emerge out of that as they help it along the way its not like they just put the pieces together and it works perfectly right up front they sometimes change the design that is called refactoring in the software industry the same thing happens with the emerging structures and project managers people work on different things and start to align those things there is guidance from their leader or project manager and it helps the whole structure to emerge there is the clear distinction between chaos and emerging structure in the beginning its kind of a chaotic youve got separate notes separate people or teams working on different things but once they start to align these elements something bigger emerges its no longer a chaos its a clear structure if you are a project manager you dont just see it and wait until this thing emerges by itself you provide your guidance and you help the elements to align you do something top down thats absolutely normal you dont stay away from it you play an active role in it
3491555 as i understand it if you do it purely bottom up you can have chaos because there is no alignment if you do it only top down it can be too rigid the combination can be found in defining the initial state some rules of interaction and from this the structure will emerge
3491556 thats correct it goes hand in hand with collective intelligence if people are not collaborating nothing will emerge or there will be chaos the vice versa is also true if you dont have flexibility in your tools and processes there will be strict force and the collaboration will end by that force as the recent research shows the collective intelligence has lot to do with weak connections not just strong connections so there has to be some flexibility for things to start working together and give really good results
3491557 in my opinion it is crucial that your tools and the processes allow you to use multiple structures in a broad sense in a project management context you have to be able to apply several work breakdown structures simultaneously
3491558 can you explain how your tool makes the connection between a to do list and the strategic planning in a word document how does it pull everything together
3491559 thats really simple lets say a person has his own to do list that to do list is part of a bigger project plan that in turn is part of correlated plan that can in turn be a part of a strategic plan i dont mean there is a stiff structure built in like this its a structure the company can build for itself along the way when there is this connection if the person changes something in his to do list the schedule will be updated on the upper levels as well the tool allows people to have their own to do list their managers can have visibility into the teams to do list and can put this into the team plan on the upper level the project manager has visibility into the plans of the different teams under him enabling him to align the teams and structure the information as a project plan this is an example people can configure their own structure people start using the tool they start from one task they start to organize things they start to align items and then it evolves into something bigger the employee does not necessarily have to view the whole plan the ceo has the whole picture but any employee can depending on the policies of the company depending on the goals see only parts of the picture
3491560 there must be a recognition that online fraud is a huge threat
3491561 its clear that state attorneys general are not doing a whole lot about internet consumer protection

3491566 were living in a global society yet our perspectives and practices are quite different
3491567 we need to understand how other countries are managing their natural resources this project will make the distance between us much smaller
3491568 this is a unique opportunity for graduate students to get two years of education for one years investment
3491569 they will also get an international experience and a chance to learn about each others approach to forestry and tree biotechnology
3491570 i look forward to working with dr joshi and others to develop this new program
3491571 building international partnerships improves the universitys ability to address the interests of students and prepare them for future leadership roles
3491572 we hope to become a model for other disciplines to conduct similar programs

3491585 the public is unhappy with the iraq war the economy is in dire straits the president a two term republican is setting records for unpopularity its very difficult for one party to win three presidential elections in a row circumstances seem to be conspiring to make 2008 a democratic year so why is barack obama running neck and neck with john mccain two weeks before the democratic convention
3491586 in what could be the biggest ever payday for a public company executive fortress investment group the hedge fund manager which floated in new york last year has given one of its star traders more than 300m 157m to stay at the firm wall street is agog at the revelation that adam levinson 38 who runs one of the main funds for fortress has been handed a giant slug of new shares in the firm giving him a stake of up to 7 per cent and diluting the power of existing shareholders the award comes despite disappointing returns from his global macro fund so far this year one of the hardest on record for the hedge fund industry it also comes as fortress shares languish at their all time lows having lost more than two thirds of their value since they began trading in february 2007
3491587 the size of some the uks best loved products has been secretly shrunk without any reduction in price
3491588 we are extremely concerned to hear about goods shrinking in size without shrinking in price as it cheats unsuspecting shoppers already under financial pressure from rising household and motoring costs in america it is known as the grocery shrink ray and this is one trend from the us that we definitely dont want too much of over here
3491589 we seek to keep our confectionery affordable in order to offer our consumers value for money and therefore we have slightly reduced the size on some of the larger sharing packs rather than directly raising prices

3491591 problems can slow us down temporarily but they dont have the ability to stop us only we have that power
3491592 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us we are hard pressed on every side but not crushed perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not abandoned struck down but not destroyed therefore we do not lose heart for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all

3491655 he knows about it so its a bit strange he would complain
3491656 hes possibly exaggerating about the four tests but certainly he is part of the program he knows he will be tested more often
3491657 the point is its a good thing if hes been tested a lot
3491658 hes a favorite for the 100 meters so why not
3491659 blood tested once and urine tested once since ive been here

3491705 obamas claims to bipartisan appeal are as thin as his record
3491706 republicans will vote for a commander in chief ready to lead not a partisan politician who is only ready to raise taxes and increase spending
3491707 obamas call for change is rooted in very old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition there is an emphasis in individual rights fairness and balance at home and progressive internationalism
3491708 and above anything else frankly i am convinced that the nation interest requires a new approach to our interactions with the world i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans independents are going to be attracted to this call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3491709 one of the challenges of the week for chicago is finding a way to control the news cycle without the candidate

3491713 on the difficult compromises that required the political courage to challenge ones own political constituency obama flinched the gang of 14 compromise on judicial appointments the immigration compromise to which obama tried to append union backed killer amendments and just last month the compromise on warrantless eavesdropping that garnered 68 votes in the senate but not obamas
3491714 the committee passed s 2566 the cooperative proliferation detection interdiction assistance and conventional threat reduction act of 2006 by unanimous consent on may 26 2006 the legislation authored by chairman lugar and senator obama enhances 1 u s cooperation with foreign governments to destroy conventional weapons stockpiles around the world and 2 the united states ability to provide assistance to foreign governments aimed at helping them detect and interdict weapons and materials of mass destruction the legislation which garnered 26 co sponsors including 8 committee members sought to energize u s programs to secure lightweight anti aircraft missiles the initiative was modeled after the nunn lugar program that focuses on weapons of mass destruction in the former soviet union the legislation was signed into law on january 11 2007 as a part of h r 6060 the department of state authorities act of 2006
3491715 senator obamas commitment to adding his strong voice and creativity to the proliferation challenge
3491716 it is a pleasure to appear before the council on foreign relations with my good friend senator barack obama as you have heard we had an extremely successful trip in august i appreciate his strong support for the nunn lugar program in his first year in the senate he has committed himself to improving the u s response to the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction we discussed existing programs and new opportunities extensively during our trip and we are eager to share with you the first public mention of the joint legislative initiative that developed from our findings i was particularly pleased that barack chose nunn lugar as the subject of his first foreign travel as a senator this choice was not an accident or the result of a last minute whim during his senate campaign well over a year ago he identified the threat posed by unsecured weapons of mass destruction as the greatest national security threat facing the united states on the foreign relations committee he has followed these issues intensely and he has been a steadfast voice of support for non proliferation efforts in this context i am enthused and encouraged by senator obamas commitment to adding his strong voice and creativity to the proliferation challenge
3491717 the amendment calls for greater investment in our preparedness efforts by providing more than 3 billion to build a stockpile of antiviral drugs and necessary medical supplies obama first introduced legislation in april requiring the united states to stockpile antiviral drugs in may obama worked with a bipartisan group of senators to appropriate the 25 million called for in the foreign assistance act authorization bill this money is currently being used by u s agencies in south east asia to combat and contain possible outbreaks of avian flu
3491718 coburn a foe of earmarking said he and obama have co sponsored other open government proposals
3491719 what a great idea create a searchable online data base of federal grants and contracts identifying the members of congress behind the spending so that citizens even on their home computers can easily determine where how and why the government is spending their money that may be why liberal democrats have joined with conservatives on the bill it presents an opportunity to break the deathgrip of incumbency coburn and the co sponsor sen barak obama d ill deserve credit for fighting doggedly for this legislation
3491720 passed largely because of the bipartisan leadership of tom coburn r okla and barack obama d ill
3491721 the federal funding accountability and transparency act is a fine accomplishment it will create an earmark database that the public can easily access on the internet the bill passed largely because of the bipartisan leadership of senators tom coburn r okla and barack obama d ill
3491722 legislation authored by u s senators barack obama d il and tom coburn m d r ok that will stop the abuse of no bid contracting in the aftermath of a disaster was included in the final department of homeland security funding bill likely to pass the senate today after senate passage the bill will go to the presidents desk to be signed into law after hurricane katrina the federal emergency management agency used emergency authority to enter into open ended no bid contracts what was meant to be temporary stop gap authority ballooned into wasteful contracts that lasted many months and wasted significant federal resources obama and coburn legislation will stop this practice by restricting the use of emergency contracting authority only to urgent needs in the immediate response to emergencies on three separate occasions obama and coburn have passed legislation in the senate that would end no bid contracting with gulf coast reconstruction funds legislation that would have specifically prohibited no bid contracts with gulf coast reconstruction was stripped from a previously passed funding bill

3491724 sens mel martinez r fl and barack obama d il today said that any immigration reform legislation must include tough border and workplace enforcement measures as well as a realistic guest worker program that acknowledges the role of the 11 million immigrants currently living and working illegally in the u s at a press conference in washington the two announced a set of principles they believe must be included in any comprehensive immigration reform package those principles include combining the strongest elements of the current border security and employment verification proposals by senator chuck hagel r ne with the most realistic workplace and earned citizenship reform program proposed by senators john mccain r az and ted kennedy d ma martinez and obama pledged to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure these complementary efforts are included in any final legislation martinez and obama today sent a letter to judiciary committee chairman arlen specter r pa outlining their principles and offering suggestions on how they could be most effectively included into the chairmans mark the two are working to build a bipartisan coalition of likeminded members who agree that any successful immigration reform proposal must include both border security and a realistic guest worker program martinez is the only immigrant currently serving in the united states senate he came to the united states at age 15 after fleeing communist cuba through a program called operation pedro pan his parents joined him four years later in orlando florida
3491725 this amendment essentially says that the prevailing wage provisions in the underlying bill should be tightened to ensure that they apply to all workers and not just some workers
3491726 after several weeks of extensive debate and consideration of numerous and complicated amendments the senate is about to move to final passage on s 2611 the comprehensive immigration reform act i also commend the senate leadership on both sides of the aisle for their efforts to ensure that the senate addressed this important issue and gave us more than adequate time for a thorough debate this is a proud moment for the united states senate as we have conducted good work and returned to orderly traditions of the legislative process as envisioned by our founding fathers and of course i commend senator kennedy who is perhaps the leading expert on this difficult issue i also want to thank senators brownback lieberman graham salazar martinez obama and dewine for their shared commitment to this issue and working to ensure this bill moved successfully intact through the legislative process
3491727 i thank those of our bipartisan group who stood together to make this legislation possible senator graham senator salazar senator martinez senator hagel senator durbin senator lieberman senator brownback senator obama and senator dewine

3491754 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3491755 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3491756 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3491757 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3491772 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3491773 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3491774 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3491815 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside
3491816 her son works two jobs and was going to propose that very day
3491817 he suddenly brought out the ring from behind his back and i just started bawling
3491818 i asked him to follow me over to the bank to give him the 100 reward he wouldnt accept the reward though
3491819 i know my wife would be sick if she lost her ring
3491820 there wasnt anything else to do it wasnt rightfully mine i had to find the owner
3491821 youre going to be mad at me for doing this but i went in to your email account yesterday and saw that someone asked if you cared if her friend asked you to be her
3491822 you obvsiously were aware that you shouldnt have checked my email account after all you texted me and asked me if it was okay to do so but got no response and then you went ahead and did it anyways
3491823 ergo the russians are using their a team as expected
3491824 the russians have gone to great lengths to try and implicate the ukraine in the russian air force losses even going as far as to suggest that an sa 5 sold to the georgians by the ukraine was responsible for the backfire loss
3491825 thats clearly not the case but shows the russian attempt to bring the ukraine into the periphery of this event by implication and to attempt to explain how one of their premier long range attack assets could have been shot down so easily
3491826 the russian press has been making lots of noise about the buk and tor systems and i would say that the buk is the most likely culprit for all of these aircraft losses
3491827 if so it points out a major flaw in the russian plan not gaining and maintaining pure air superiority and dominance over the battlespace by taking out the georgian air defenses and air defense network before they went into the conflict
3491828 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3491829 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3491830 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3491831 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3491832 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3491833 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3491834 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3491835 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them
3491836 theres a distinction between trumpeting issues and realistically looking at effectiveness
3491837 i have never known a time period where the american brand has been in less repair
3491838 we hope that theyll be a real part of our community
3491839 sharing all of the intellectual aspects of what goes on so that means working with us developing new technologies and passing it on to our students as well
3491840 theres the robotics institute where we are now the entertainment technology center which was co founded by randy pausch who did work at disney imagineering at one time
3491841 disney i think has a big place in everybodys hearts that grew up in the country and grew up with those movies so its very exciting
3491842 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3491843 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3491844 we couldnt find anybody that would help us and we could lose the whole building if it the bell tower would fall and collapse into the building
3491845 theyre doing a good thing here and just try to help them get their church so they can open the doors
3491846 i cant believe someone would just step up to the plate like that and its just so nice to see other people give with their heart and soul
3491847 coming up this morning during hard times in some u s cities theyre as good as gold manhole covers being stolen and sold for scrap
3491848 across the country thieves are stealing metal objects like manhole covers because the price of scrap metal has sky rocketed
3491849 thats right thieves are literally stealing the street right out from under you one area of the nation hardest hit by these thefts is philadelphia typically theyd lose about a hundred manhole covers or grates a year to theft but in the past year 2 000 have gone missing
3491850 when you look at this street you probably see a manhole cover but to a thief this looks like free money
3491851 each cover nets a thief a grand total of about 10
3491852 in philadelphia this girl is one of two children who suffered minor injuries from falling into open holes
3491853 that can be a very dangerous situation but you know you can never be too surprised at the creativity and the lengths that people will go you know when facing you know a financial challenge trying to take care of themselves
3491854 its a public safety problem and an expensive one in a year philadelphia replaced 2 000 manhole covers at the cost of 150 each then these two employees came up with a cheaper solution simply chain the covers down philadelphia is also looking at other creative solutions to protect its 140 000 covers in the coming months itll be testing plastic covers such as this one
3491855 most will bring a plate of snacks and some booze nobody minds they all think its a great idea
3491856 most brides would want their dress to cost thousands of pounds but that wasnt ever an option for me our credit crunch wedding is going to be the best day of our lives and without breaking the bank
3491857 its surprising how cheap things are when you look around the budget kept threatening to creep up but i wouldnt let it
3491858 this is something albany fire trains on regularly and it paid off this morning
3491859 the time i shared with lucy lauren and cason was the happiest time in my life i remain a person of interest because she was my fianc e and was pregnant with our child i was apparently the last person to speak with her which was our nightly routine i have cooperated fully from day one with captain shaw and his team of detectives without legal council unlike other persons of interest who already had legal council during the first interrogation anyone close to this case knows who did this were just not allowed to discuss it i continue to cooperate fully with the investigation and hope soon theyll apprehend the arsonist lucys death has devastated so many lives my world has been shattered beyond belief we all are grieving her loss
3491860 weve got eight established players im really excited about who we have on the team
3491861 this time i think its clear that we are the underdogs going into these matches
3491862 im really glad i dont have to pick four players this morning
3491863 our culture our heritage is here this is where we grew up
3491864 i said you have the wrong press conference and if you want to talk to me about anything else you wait until after the press conference
3491865 i dont want to talk about something that will soon be proven to be without facts this is just another day in the life and the successes of charlie rangel and one guy writes a story and 100 people pick it up but im convinced in talking with the newspaper that a lot of corrections will be made
3491866 there is no one that doesnt like me no one even those people
3491867 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
3491868 is obama touched or tainted by this in any stretch of the imagination
3491869 i dont think he is at all lester you know if anything sure that they lose a good surrogate this was a guy who was very good on the stump
3491870 is there any stomach for john mccain perhaps using taking some political advantage of this or will he simply leave this alone as a third rail
3491871 not at all theyre probably going to leave this alone john mccain had to deal with a story that their campaign was very upset about that the new york times did theyre not going to touch this you know stuff like this usually ends up getting swept under the rug pretty quickly
3491872 can the right wing withstand yet another scandal involving one of its own
3491873 um if hes faced that many more shots shouldnt he have even more saves than hartman and busch
3491874 we are glad to see cnpc participating in the beijing olympic games as an official partner in the category of crude oil and natural gas
3491875 we will transport oil and gas by whichever route is profitable
3491876 we are opening the caspian route at the request of turkmenistan
3491877 existing technical legal environmental and other risks relating to the trans caspian project are so great that it would be impossible to find an investor
3491878 unless this is a political project and then it does not matter what would be inside the pipeline as long as it exists
3491879 if these claims are substantiated and if the turkmens find investors to produce this gas the possibility of the trans caspian pipeline remains on the table
3491880 if politicians really have a strong desire to get more gas that would bypass russia they could offer to incur some financial losses and risks
3491881 we take our responsibility in the world energy supply very seriously

3491883 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place by the belt
3491884 even with the conveyor belt matching the planes take off speed the plane moves forward past the traffic cones
3491885 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3491886 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3491887 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3491888 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3491889 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3491890 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3491891 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3491892 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3491893 they know that were coming back to redeem ourselves and im pretty sure that they watch us a lot
3491894 has been circled on my calendar for about two years now
3491895 weve got veterans were preparing ourselves every night were showcasing what weve been doing the last three years getting ready for this moment
3491896 so we cant afford to go out and be lackadaisical
3491897 we were not looking ahead i thought we played with really good energy in spurts and played some really terrific basketball
3491898 our goal wasnt to win by a certain margin it was to really work hard and keep up our pressure and then once that was done we just worked on a few other things the main thing was just to keep some consistency so overall i was very pleased with tonight
3491899 i think we have to adjust to being spot up shooters all of us were not acclimated to being spot up shooters so thats something we have to tweak a little bit and get used to
3491900 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3491901 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3491902 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3491903 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3491904 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3491905 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3491906 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3491907 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3491908 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3491909 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3491910 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3491911 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3491912 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3491913 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3491914 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3491915 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3491916 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3491917 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3491918 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3491919 im not sure how we top britney opening the show
3491920 im not sure how we top britney opening the show
3491921 had my father really wished that this novel not be released he would have destroyed it himself
3491922 to be honest halfway in the third round i got up and walked out of the arena and went to my hotel
3491923 the fight wasnt the most exciting and i wanted to get out of there before everyone else was getting up to leave
3491924 ive asked myself a thousand times since my fight saturday why i fought demian maia on the ground and i dont have an answer for it
3491925 that wasnt the game plan we trained that if the fight goes to the ground that i would work to get into a position to get the fight back up on the feet and i just didnt do it
3491926 i dont know what went wrong in my head i dont know what happened and why i chose to fight that fight on the ground sure i made the fight exciting and ive gotten lots of positive responses on how well i did on the ground with a guy like maia but at the end of the day he caught me and thats what he does best i played into this game
3491927 that the thoughts prayers and support of the american people are with that great little nation as it struggles today
3491928 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3491929 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3491930 now is the time for action not just words it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3491931 really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3491932 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the safety of our peacekeeping forces and civilian population has been restored
3491933 should centres of resistance or other aggressive attempts arise you must take the decision to destroy them
3491934 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3491935 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3491936 i think its open to interpretation and thats the great thing
3491937 you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they wanna do
3491938 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3491939 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people
3491940 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3491941 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3491942 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3491943 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable

3491946 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3491947 this is a wonderful organisation this year they trained 42 guide dogs and 22 assistance dogs for children with autism so visually impaired and blind people would not be able to operate independent lives if it was not for the great work done by the irish guide dogs for the blind
3491948 in addition to training the dogs they also provide mobility training for people who are visually impaired in independent living skills and thats invaluable in allowing people to be able to live at home and in their own community
3491949 obviously there is a lot of pressure on public funding but clearly over the years we have been very supportive of the irish guide dogs for the blind although the organisation has now made the case for more money
3491950 a lot of competing worthy organisations supporting people with disabilities are seeking additional resources and in the context of the priority on resources we try and make as much money as available particularly to an organisation supporting the blind and visually impaired
3491951 some of the least qualified and poorest students are most adversely affected by term time employment their everyday university experiences were very different from the minority who did not need to work or who could confine their jobs to the vacations put starkly these students worked for a short term cash benefit and emerged from university with large debts a history of working in bars and shops and poorer degree results their more affluent and successful peers worked for a longer term career benefit and emerged with lower debt interesting cvs and good degree results
3491952 non abbiamo ancora nessun artista sotto contratto per il super bowl

3491954 as a naive 14 year old in sydney an under pressure 18 year old in athens and i guess a relieved 23 year old here
3491955 my whole life worth was based on winning a gold medal
3491956 whether i won a gold medal or finished last didnt matter
3491957 i may have looked composed on the outside on the inside i was shaking like a leaf i was tearing up behind the dais
3491958 they see me swim for two minutes in a race and they see my reaction they havent seen the four years of hard work behind it the blood sweat and tears and fighting to stay positive most days
3491959 it was very very difficult to be thrust into the limelight
3491960 i mean what next then im glad i went through the silvers and the bronzes
3491961 im a pretty quiet reserved person everyone has a comment that im pretty blase but i just do what comes naturally thats me
3491962 recognize respect protect and celebrate all of the loving families they seek to represent
3491963 but we also have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
3491964 ill be a president that stands up for american families all of them
3491965 regardless of their sexual orientations and gender identities regardless of how many parents or caregivers are present in a family all parents begin each day with their children at the forefront of their thoughts on behalf of diverse families it is critical to know how the platforms of our candidates will address lgbt and other diverse family needs

3491970 never before in our countrys history has there been a national party platform that is so inclusive of our entire community is the platform perfect no is it a good foundation unequivocally yes
3491971 the vision put forth in the 2008 democratic national platform is historic in its embrace of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender americans never before in our countrys history has there been a national party platform that is so inclusive of our entire community
3491972 it is a forward looking platform in so many areas including those relating to lgbt people
3491973 the plank that includes a comprehensive employment non discrimination act recognizes the lgbt communitys call for fully inclusive legislation a critical element if we are to have legislation that protects all of us equally
3491974 is the platform perfect no there is much more work to be done especially to improve issues of family recognition however is it a good foundation unequivocally yes
3491975 the upholstery gets saturated its hard to get rid of that mildew smell once its wet
3491976 my father and mother ran the garage before me and i think this is about the worst its ever been
3491977 the streams and the culverts were cleared out we made sure of that a couple of weeks ago
3491978 it was about three and a half feet of water in there
3491979 what weve done is built away of patterning the essence of a video in a single pattern
3491980 oxidation leads to inflammation and plaque formation within the arteries no matter what your cholesterol level is in fact the majority of people dying of heart disease have normal ldl cholesterol levels the reason because their ldl cholesterol and arteries are oxidized
3491981 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3491982 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3491983 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3491984 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3491985 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3491986 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3491987 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3491988 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed
3491989 o tempo foi ruim n o era o que eu esperava

3492155 sidney wolfe public citizens general secretary of junk science has just filed a citizens petition with the fda calling for a black box warning on ed medications because of 48 events of naion non arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy a loss of vision that is frequently irreversible
3492156 suggesting that sidney have his eyes examined would only be a partial diagnosis
3492157 has once again failed in this responsibility these drugs need much stronger warnings especially a black box warning such as the one we have proposed

3492159 powerful members of congress want to remake the food and drug administration by giving it broad powers to levy fines order drug recalls and restrict drug industry advertising
3492160 perhaps most importantly they want the next president to appoint a tough fda commissioner completely independent from the industry
3492161 messrs dingell and grassley and their allies have ordered about 20 investigations of drugs and issues involving the fda
3492162 mr grassley began his campaign to overhaul the fda in 2004 during an uproar about the agencys slow reaction to potential links between popular antidepressants and teen suicides
3492163 now he has four staffers and a parade of fda whistleblowers helping him investigate a plethora of fda controversies such as its approval of the antibiotic ketek
3492164 some current and former fda safety reviewers have opened a whistleblower website to air their concerns that fda leaders are pushing them to approve some drugs
3492165 a website launched and operated by current and former us food and drug administration staff who believe public health is being put at unnecessary risk these concerned civil servants and ex civil servants have either experienced or are aware of wrongful directives by us fda upper management directives that put public health at avoidable risk

3492168 the motive may be either to get drugs approved or not approved it cuts both ways
3492169 good thing she didnt include this stirring stupak statement from an la times article about why andy von eschenbach sandy kweder janet woodcock and the fdas cafeteria guy should resign
3492170 the drug companies know that this administration will do nothing to them there is no fear of the fda with this culture with laissez faire oversight and regulation i think they should be gone if we get rid of them it will put the drug companies on notice
3492171 heparin hypocrisy hyped up safety fears on adhd drugs does medicaid kill poor people
3492172 yet another show trial held by another congressional committee on the fda there have been four or five over the last two months on heparin alone
3492173 who is gaining momentum along with the fda in shifting the agency towards a science and systems based approach to regulation using real time technology to promote full time compliance has to sit and take the following from the likes of bart stupak d michigan
3492174 last year this nations regulatory failures resulted in dead dogs and cats this year it has tragically led to the deaths of people
3492175 if we dont make some rapid progress on fixing the foreign drug inspection program the next melamine or heparin tragedy will soon be upon us
3492176 coming from a guy who helped push up the suicide rates by scaring parents away from antidepressants and who is pushing for drug importation at a time when al qaeda and hezbollah are involved in drug counterfeiting

3492178 meanwhile the steve nissen fear factory spews out another piece of tabloid medicine ekg monitoring of all kids getting stimulants for adhd
3492179 now theres a way to achieve nissen who has never studied adhd goal of making a physicians hand quiver before writing a scrip for the drug
3492180 scott gottlieb is a lot of things public servant physician pundit he is my former colleague at the fda most importantly he is my friend
3492181 and my blood boils with anger and frustration at todays scurrilous attack on him in the seattle times
3492182 scott i know personally i know that he takes his work at the fda seriously i know that he takes his government oath to protect the public health seriously i know that he is highly ethical and honest and i know how much this article must hurt him personally
3492183 and im sure that is precisely why certain lupine elements are gleefully forwarding this ugly hit piece to their friends and colleagues
3492184 if people dont agree with his policy positions they should dispute them firmly strongly logically and respectfully
3492185 that they have chosen character assassination only shows the weakness of their intellectual arguments as well as their disappointing lack of character
3492186 new and better way to establish drug safety that solves a one of the more serious problems in drug development namely that animal studies are often a poor and inaccurate substitute for what happens in human
3492187 sid wolfe has opposed every effort to speed drugs to dying patients since he has been on his anti patient jihad starting in 1970
3492188 since his organization makes money by hawking a book worst pills best pills that argues the most drugs are dangerous
3492189 is partially responsible for the decline in ssri prescription use and the corresponding increase in adolescent suicide
3492190 and this guy is head of the health subcommittee why is he being taken seriously why isnt he being held accountable
3492191 ssris have not been proven effective in treating adolescent depression to the contrary their use may actually increase the suicide rate of its young patients
3492192 in response to these reports of increased suicide rates with ssri use fda officials suppressed their own post marketing surveillance prohibited fda employees from discussing the report and launched an investigation to find the person who leaked information to the press today ssris remain on the market without a clear medical benefit to the patient
3492193 there should be a black box warning around everything stupak says regarding medicines
3492194 particularly ssris which have been shown to benefit patients and are associated with a decline in suicides
3492195 dr healy recently testified at the fda hearing on antidepressants he is a psychiatry professor at cardiff university in wales but also according to the new york times has worked for plaintiffs lawyers in cases brought against pharmaceutical companies thats transparency
3492196 when i served as associate commissioner at the fda dr healy visited with me but he never mentioned that he worked for the tort bar
3492197 when i went into the fda to meet with peter pitts i made no efforts to conceal my links to trial attorneys some of whom were at the meeting and no efforts were made to conceal my links to the pharmaceutical industry all of which were well known
3492198 because in my experience republicans such as senator grassley and staffers working for them such as emilia desanto have appeared more concerned about and more effective on the issue than anyone else and as a republican appointee i thought peter pitts heart might be in the right place
3492199 what was not well known at the time was that peter pitts was transiting between working for pharmaceutical companies or perhaps not even transiting
3492200 im not sure how many of us would have felt it worth going if we had known his background
3492201 it seems astonishing to me now that with people like peter pitts in fda that it was ever possible to bring the suicidality issues to light
3492202 and again there is no link to ssris and in increase in suicides rather some unclear evidence based on an unvalidated measure called suicidality that includes just talking about self harm in general
3492203 whose flawed study about ssris and suicide triggered a series of events which lead to less ssri use and more suicide
3492204 the increase amounted to roughly 10 percent and that occurred in a year in which new and controversial black box warnings were added to the labeling on the medications
3492205 for his persistence zeal and determination to damage not only the fda but the public health for his effectiveness in fear mongering and willingness to subordinate medical progress to his ascetic view of safety
3492206 but he seems to spend a lot of time in the halls of congress advising members and staff about which fda medical reviewers should be hauled in for polite conversations
3492207 setting aside dr grahams contribution to the vioxx populi literature which an fda advisory committee considered to be a rather shoddy piece of research he also helped push through the statistical analysis and organize the public outcry over ssris that resulted in a decline in antidepressant use and a corresponding increase in teen suicides
3492208 his assertion that avandia should be taken off the market
3492209 is best remembered in 2007 as the conduit for steve nissens half baked meta analysis of avandia
3492210 helped blow out of all appropriate proportion fear about drug safety in general and avandia in particular
3492211 persistent undermining of the fda came close to winning him clipboard top honors for 2007
3492212 the food and drug administration was also negligent in the vioxx case those running the nations public safety agency repeatedly dismissed the concerns of their own scientists and seemed to do everything possible to keep the public in the dark about emerging problems with vioxx
3492213 i wonder how much more money the senator will get from the trial lawyer lizards as a reward for such vituperative rants
3492214 members of congress and senior officials of the fda should be ashamed of themselves for giving graham the chance to not only rant on about vioxx and ssris but to make the same claims about ketek and drugs for schizophrenia

3492216 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
3492217 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
3492218 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
3492219 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
3492220 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
3492221 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
3492222 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
3492223 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
3492224 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
3492225 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
3492226 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
3492227 without the presence of a vulnerability these techniques dont really accomplish anything
3492228 todays settlement sends a resounding message to the entire auction rate securities industry this type of deceptive behavior will not be tolerated and we will actively seek justice on behalf of investors in auction rate securities

3492235 i just couldnt get myself into shape we italians havent got used to competition in the morning
3492236 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3492237 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3492238 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3492239 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3492240 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3492241 obviously to hear his voice and get leadership from him meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys
3492242 he just told us it will be difficult but together were going to be much stronger
3492243 he knows we need him im sure his interests are conflicted hell be back when hes ready
3492244 we didnt know if it was something related to u s athletes or usa volleyball or a random act of violence which we now know it was
3492245 my wife always puts things in perspective she said bad things happen in ft wayne indiana where were from every day but we still go to coney island downtown we still go get gas we still go to wal mart

3492247 mccutheons a wonderful passionate loving coach who cares about his team and about what were trying to build and develop here
3492248 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3492249 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3492250 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3492251 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3492252 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3492253 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3492254 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3492255 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3492256 they were yelling and screaming and whacking me in the head
3492257 you should be interviewing the guy who exposed himself in front of two 9 year olds
3492258 if i had resisted those three guys id probably be dead or in a coma right now

3492279 after safety jermaine phillips intercepted a pass in 11 on 11 drills and began returning the pick linebacker ryan nece laid a block on unsuspecting wide receiver brian clark the young wideout was clearly not pleased at being knocked to the turf and immediately jumped to his feet to confront nece ronde barber and maurice stovall quickly stepped in to keep the peace

3492283 mark is a true team player and he consistently goes above and beyond the call to make sure everything he can do to further an investigation is being done
3492284 this time a dangerous sex offender was apprehended thanks to marks work and his willingness to immediately share pertinent information with another law enforcement agency this time the u s marshals
3492285 this recognition is well deserved because mark exemplifies all that is right with law enforcement this apprehension was the result of hard work and a willingness to provide any and all assistance he could to the u s marshals service and indeed to any law enforcement agency in order to get the job done
3492286 this is how its supposed to work law enforcement agencies regardless of whether theyre local state or federal entities collaborating in such a way as to protect the public in ways no single agency could accomplish by itself we are grateful to senior detective silk and secretary of state dunlap for their help in this case and we are eager to see this level of inter agency cooperation continue as we move forward

3492298 theres nothing i could have done more or better or focused more or anything thats all i had today and thats the way it goes
3492299 i think i have it in me if i want to if i enjoy it ill carry on well see how things go but it would be disappointing to finish like that
3492300 you work for two years for it and to produce that is very disappointing but i know that i did everything in my power to get there
3492301 to be honest for the last year my form hasnt been where i wanted it to be and i tried everything i threw everything at it
3492302 i moved away from home to try and focus more but it seems the harder you try the slower you go i had three or four years where i was doing everything i wanted to do and i was on top but sometimes its just not there as much as you try i wish i had answers
3492303 i think ive got a lot to offer people if they want to hear it and my door is always open i can see myself doing that and thats the plan with my academy in centurion to give something back after four olympics maybe five
3492304 it was more than two seconds off my best time so im really happy with that maybe it was all the people watching that made me swim fast i couldnt really go out there and embarrass myself
3492305 but my coach and i have been working really hard and obviously the hard work is starting to pay off
3492306 i tried to take it out quite hard because people have been taking it out quite fast here so i didnt want to fall behind
3492307 the second 100 i just try to hold it i did get a bit tired in the second 100 but i managed to hold on at least obviously im really happy it was a close race there between neil and i its going to be another close race tomorrow again
3492308 the atmosphere is incredible theres no way you can swim slowly in this place
3492309 after the first 100 i turned and saw everyone there and knew the race was on and i had to push that third 50 pretty hard so it was good
3492310 im not really worried about swimming a semi in the morning the problem is just trying to get this lactic acid out of me tonight trying to get a good nights rest and hopefully come back a little faster
3492311 as huge as madibas 90th birthday on 10 years more
3492312 yeah at this stage we south africa dont have that kind of player yet on saturday well definitely have one
3492313 i dont think it could happen to a greater rugby player in our history ive known percy since 1979 i mean 1997 laughing
3492314 this 100th test cap on saturday its as huge as madibas 90 only its 10 years more
3492315 im blessed to work with people like him i will try to keep him calm because i know there is a whirlwind inside him im looking forward to sharing that milestone with him over the weekend
3492316 he is the professional player now and he brings experience to the team his extraordinary experience even when hes not playing hes the same player the same character and you can see it on his face
3492317 what makes him so great is that he is prepared to share his knowledge with everybody in the side he is not keeping anything for himself well this week is going to be huge for him but percy knows that the job is more important than the milestone
3492318 the 100th is going to be special especially at newlands and playing against new zealand makes it even more special
3492319 i try not to talk about it but i get a few of the guys his teammates chirping me at training sessions
3492320 it was ricky who helped make history in the house of pain
3492321 personally i think ricky has proved himself as south africas leading scrumhalf
3492322 is it fouries world cup status that now elevates him above ricky in my view fourie has done nothing to justify a place in the starting lineup
3492323 conrad jantjes is on present form the no 1 fullback it is worrying that people make decisions with their heart to give someone montgomery his 100th test cap
3492324 i know peter wants to win the tri nations but he must realise he will be measured according to his ability to transform the team and to make it representative of the countrys population for the 2011 world cup
3492325 we have also seen nothing of the new type of rugby that peter has spoken of
3492326 it is interesting that coloureds and blacks traditionally support the all blacks when they play at newlands
3492327 is the team that has been selected of such a nature that it will ensure the support of most south africans
3492328 we cannot repeat the cycle of the white era we must build for 2011
3492329 it is easy to fall into a comfort zone peter should be reminded of his mandate
3492330 its not all about transformation but it transformation is an important part of it not one black player has let south africa down this year

3492336 although the declines in notices of defaults seem promising much of this can be explained by the actions of just one lender
3492337 ninety one percent of the decline in notices of default since april can be attributed to countrywide financial unfortunately this is more likely due to the challenges of integrating two companies the size of countrywide financial and bank of america than it is a fundamental shift in foreclosure activity
3492338 newly introduced legislation would protect legal rights of patients harmed by defective medical devices
3492339 the fda used to be the gold standard but the agency has come under scrutiny recently if manufacturers are putting faulty devices on the market they must be held accountable to the patients who use them the way congress always intended i will continue to fight for legislation like this that puts the health and safety of americans ahead of manufacturers interests
3492340 if enacted this legislation would create a patchwork approach to medical device approvals where state courts would effectively review and regulate medical devices

3492349 as a dealer and member of drivingsales i find the strategy postings by fellow members a great way to get quick ideas and inspiration
3492350 youll find a dealership in a totally different part of the country selling a different franchise who is facing the same exact sales or staffing challenge that you are and theyve found a creative solution which they write about on drivingsales its a great site to get fresh ideas quickly and easily
3492351 they say necessity is the mother of invention and we know that many of our members have developed really innovative methods to deal with the current environment of high gas prices and a slow economy
3492352 weve launched the next contest to tap into this wealth of knowledge and help during a particularly challenging time as a continuously growing resource for dealers and the automotive industry these contests are a fun way to engage community members and build drivingsales ever expanding content
3492353 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it

3492358 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside
3492359 her son works two jobs and was going to propose that very day
3492360 he suddenly brought out the ring from behind his back and i just started bawling
3492361 i asked him to follow me over to the bank to give him the 100 reward he wouldnt accept the reward though
3492362 i know my wife would be sick if she lost her ring
3492363 there wasnt anything else to do it wasnt rightfully mine i had to find the owner
3492364 i always hide in the basement but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3492365 there were so many fragments i believe they use that kind of ammunition to hit infantry but they showered it on our heads
3492366 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3492367 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3492368 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3492369 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3492370 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3492371 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3492372 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3492373 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3492374 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3492375 now theyve started letting them out of the bus in front of our house
3492376 if were about to leave and someone yells star tours you hit the ground if you go down they cant see you

3492394 as annie just finished her first week of chemotherapy last friday i had a chance to see how her battle with cancer while frightening has also resulted in an unexpected blessing of allowing us to experience gods love through the encouragement and support of many people at our church although cancer is not a situation that we want to be in i am grateful for the opportunity we have had to experience so much love and support through it through this ive been able to appreciate gods rich blessings in my life more this is truly the church this is how we are supposed to live life
3492395 wondered about the depth of mccains commitment to that position initially because i had the impression that it wasnt something that hed given a lot of thought to
3492396 when we really explored it it really came down for him to a sanctity of life question he did get very emotional one time we talked about it he truly believed

3492428 the facts should have led the denver department of human services caseworkers to a conclusion of inconclusive or founded for abuse or neglect given the credible report of abuse by chandler to the school and one law enforcement officer and a documented injury indicative of non accidental trauma

3492433 there definitely were laws which were broken just in the way he conducted the transaction
3492434 for instance he set one price and did half the job and doubled the price so obviously theres some fraud there

3492486 you big git im sure i can think of something for us to do
3492487 theres no reason someone is gonna pay 1 20 extra in taxes for a 4 dollar case of water in chicago when they can go to the suburbs to buy it without that tax

3492489 there is still some oil production from the caspian and it is being exported through two other routes one is a rail link from baku to batumi
3492490 and the other link one is another pipeline known as the northern route and that is operated by the azerbaijan national company socar from baku to novorossisk
3492491 what has been suspended as a precaution because of the problems in georgia is the production of gas into the pipeline at baku
3492492 but a gas pipeline is high pressure so you can still supply gas out the other end into turkey even though you are not pumping gas into it at baku and there is probably several days of supply still in turkey
3492493 although bp has halted oil shipments along smaller pipelines through georgia as a precaution the quantities of crude oil involved are relatively small and in any case may soon resume if moscows announcement this morning of a halt to military operations proves to be a step towards de escalation
3492494 that is not to say that there are no important ramifications for the oil market from recent events in the caucasus
3492495 in the context of falling non opec crude oil output from other parts of the world this extra oil is vital
3492496 what has been highlighted over the past few days is that despite the careful routing of pipelines to avoid both russia and the middle east it still comes with a very significant degree of political risk
3492497 weve been able to place some people ourselves in terms of our own operations on the island

3492499 you look at the numbers the slump in the united states is continuing
3492500 inconsistent with the viewpoints and knowledge generally accepted in the scientific community
3492501 because plaintiffs fail to raise any genuine issue of material fact to support their as applied claims defendants motion is granted
3492502 the problem is not that the creationist view is taught as an alternative to scientific explanations but that the nature of science the theory of evolution and critical thinking are not taught adequately
3492503 plaintiffs offer little admissible evidence to the contrary plaintiffs biology expert dr michael behe submitted a declaration concluding that the bju text mentions standard scientific content however professor behe did not consider how much detail or depth the texts gave to this standard content therefore professor behe fails to refute one of professor kennedys primary concerns that the nature of science the theory of evolution and critical thinking are not taught adequately accordingly there is no genuine issue of material fact as to this issue defendants had a rational basis for rejecting calvary baptists proposed biology course
3492504 unfortunately the political response has been with absurdities like creating hov lanes on the 403 taking away an active traffic lane from an already congested highway dedicated diamond lanes giving consideration to bicycles and other such nonsense

3492517 during the second quarter we experienced material shortages and model changeover start up issues in our armor division
3492518 our battery division had significant negative currency adjustments between the dollar and the israeli shekel and a corresponding decline in margins but our simulation division continued with another strong quarter with revenues up 39 over the same quarter last year
3492519 we are optimistic that our armor and battery divisions will get back on scheduled production and deliveries for a strong second half of 2008
3492520 gino is a rare combination of a real numbers man and an individual with strong leadership capabilities
3492521 his expertise insight and leadership abilities led our company through a dramatic turnaround since the merging of hearx and helix and he has positioned the company well for continued record growth i am honored to announce his promotion to president and have the greatest confidence in his ability to lead us into an exciting new era at hearusa
3492522 we are proud of our expansion into the mid atlantic and believe there are a number of caf opportunities and markets for our company to expand into
3492523 john and his team at encore provided us with the ability to expand quickly and worked to deliver our caf on time and on budget
3492524 partnering with a major player in the emerging organic market is a great opportunity for encore construction
3492525 healthy has become a strong focus in the restaurant industry organic to go will be well received in the dc market
3492526 we continued to enjoy healthy organic revenue growth this quarter despite the current economic environment
3492527 the successful launch of a new siemens product helped drive another record quarter in revenues we were also successful in acquiring several new centers during the quarter with the centers acquired over the last year demonstrating solid performance
3492528 yesterdays joint announcement of the new aarp services and hearusa relationship represents a new and exciting direction for us
3492529 as part of the initial three year term of our agreement hearusa has committed to launching the pilot program on december 1 in florida and new jersey then we will be rolling out the hearing care program to all 50 states and the five us territories in order to serve aarps 39 million members as quickly as possible but no later than 2010 we are also reaching out to the industry both manufacturers and hearing care professionals inviting them to participate in this program on an equal basis

3492534 the funds energy operations for the second quarter were affected by the normal seasonality and cyclical nature of oil and gas operations due to spring break up although our results were in line with the second quarter of the previous year some encouraging signs of increased activity are beginning to emerge
3492535 the funds results in the second quarter on the non energy side of our portfolio marked an improvement over the previous year as we continue to make progress in strengthening our market position particularly at ezee on don park and beco
3492536 as a result of these improvements we expect a higher contribution from these businesses for the balance of 2008 as compared to last year
3492537 in both our annual report and our recent first quarter results we mentioned that there would be the opportunity for accretive acquisitions during the coming year the recent difficulties experienced by semcanada and ceg have provided us with one of these opportunities
3492538 this purchase fits with our strategy in two ways first in addition to residential customers the ceg customers fit the profile of the stable but targeted larger commercial customers we have accumulated across all of our other markets second we immediately enhance our strategic position in the b c commercial and residential markets where we are already currently active this transaction while not large is immediately accretive to our unitholders
3492539 i am pleased that we are able to offer continuity of fixed price supply to these customers the ccaa filings by semcanada and ceg left many of them in a position where advantageously priced contracts would have been cancelled unless taken up by another supplier we have agreed to honor the obligation to supply these contracts and we hope that this will aid us in renewing these customers at the end of their term this transaction underscores the importance of committing to long term supply with proven creditworthy suppliers like energy savings

3492546 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3492547 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3492548 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3492549 in half the time and cost with double the profit and fun
3492550 the apparent recent loss of an important population of the marsh fritillary which is possibly linked to the failure of mitigation measures associated with the nearby ennis bypass is a matter of serious concern that has yet to be investigated and pursued by the national parks and wildlife service
3492551 a flood assessment of the site and the proposed development taking into account cumulative effects of other development is lacking
3492552 the proposed development will result in significant biodiversity losses in terms of wetland habitats of ecological value and invertebrate populations including permanent losses or local extinction of the eu habitats directive species marsh fritillary
3492553 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3492554 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3492555 once you start urbanisation on flood plains you remove the storage capability for flooding and the water ends up going into the main channel down stream
3492556 low lying more vulnerable areas should not be built on we should not be putting people in there and you have to be very careful about putting infrastructure such as roads and rail in
3492557 when walls are put in around a development this can affect other areas and make the flood peak higher and the flood peak quicker than it otherwise would
3492558 in the short term a house could be built and sold and 10 years down the line thats when the flooding happens when the person who built and sold the house is long since departed leaving long term flooding problems behind
3492559 the problem starts earlier than with the developers local authorities rezone agricultural land for residential development and people are entitled to expect that if the land has been zoned for housing and theyve bought a house built on it that there isnt a problem
3492560 the ultimate bottom line is that we shouldnt be rezoning in areas that are known to have a vulnerability to flooding more conservative planning is whats needed the precautionary principle needs to be applied more ruthlessly in order so that you dont put people at risk you have to take a long term view

3492562 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3492605 no one wants to pay 160 to 180 for power backup until they get hit by an outage were selling lots of apc certain times of the year are more susceptible to lightning strikes in the old days wed stock more modems now we stock more routers network cards system boards and power supplies
3492606 we dont do that much business for homeowners but lightning blew up the chimney and everything electronic in the house got fried
3492607 we thought wed see a lot lower spending this summer but more people are staying at home its called staycation its been one of our busiest summers ever
3492608 the lightning and thunderstorms have people coming in all the time with power supply issues and system board upgrades
3492609 a lot of the boards fried by thunderstorms are older boards that arent manufactured anymore so people will buy a new computer

3492630 the difference is the nature of the kind of outsized profits they make that may have no relationship to their investments or their production the fact for example the shortage of refinery capacity could actually increase their profits so the less they invest the more they make indicates that you are not dealing with someone making widgets out there

3492828 what is called the music business today however is not the business of producing music at some point it became the business of selling cds in plastic cases and that business will soon be over but thats not bad news for music and its certainly not bad news for musicians indeed with all the ways to reach an audience there have never been more opportunities for artists
3492829 when trading you are committing your money to something that you have no control over so you have to do it in a way to keep yourself out of trouble you need a system to help you in volatile markets
3492830 we are raking in heaps of cash and everyone else is lucky to be a stepping stone in our climb to incalculable wealth
3492831 these men who have turned the world upside down have come here also and jason has received them and they are all acting against the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king jesus
3492832 the way that you asked your question is very very helpful because i think it perhaps indirectly points out what i think is the big challenge for many of our brothers and sisters in christ on this question the reason why i believe that question is ultimately immaterial is because in using the language of progressive sanctification we have already moved a step or two away from the issue which is definitive sanctification if in my union with christ the death of christ is mine not only as a satisfaction of my sins but also as the permanent and final disruption of my relationship to the old order and of the man of sin if the decisive breach has taken place in terms of sanctification and not only in terms of justification then there is no such thing as a union with christ in one benefit that is not at the same time a union with christ for every benefit if we have a solid understanding of definitive sanctification that in christs death i died not only to the law in terms of its demands justification but also with respect to my sinful flesh that i was crucified with christ then that same covenant historical event of the death and resurrection of christ with its significance which goes beyond just justification but to every benefit precludes granting any one of those benefits priority over the others now if you dont have a doctrine of definitive sanctification if you have trouble with that idea then yes certainly to hear equal ultimacy language would be disconcerting
3492833 friedman tells stories well with a keen eye for wars absurdities and his own fading illusions of wars glory
3492834 emotionally honest friedman allows readers to experience things alongside him rather than merely gasp in awe at his heroics or sit clucking in judgment
3492835 a time to lead confirms the rewarding benefits of military service at a time when such service is experiencing considerable strain it also includes a comprehensive description of americas current national imperatives which deserve serious consideration

3492852 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3492853 were trying to get an assessment of exactly what it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3492854 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3492855 their lives were lived in a way that brought joy to others god has a place for them

3492861 i think everyone knew he was capable of swimming 52 mid
3492862 i dont know if he realizes that he finished a half second ahead of the field
3492863 he keeps saying it was close but really he kinda killed us
3492864 i think he considers me competition but its a good competition
3492865 were aggressive and always put up a fight and work together well
3492866 i think we give the boys a run for their money i think were just as competitive as they are
3492867 on the field we yell at each other but it doesnt mean anything
3492868 weve been the underdog before but were ready to change that were ready to win
3492869 oh i see so we have conjured up a large meteor now interesting well thats uniform layers up the spout it would lose matter as it hit the atmosphere but it would not break up of course and would not be drawn to the magnetic poles
3492870 the layers of the geocolumn could only happen with rapid flood sediment deposition and normal aggregate seperation some of the layers show mixing as happens in wave motion
3492871 the bible states clearly that when the flood began all the fountains of the great deep were broken up in a single day and the water came forth this great cataclysm was foretold in the names of the first ten patriarchs and noah was warned more than 100 years in advance to prepare an ark to the saving of his house
3492872 the layers of the geocolumn could only happen with rapid flood sediment deposition and normal aggregate seperation some of the layers show mixing as happens in wave motion
3492873 there is not enough subterranean water to cover the whole globe to a height of 27 000 feet
3492874 and that quote my friend summarises the dilemna that you creationists find yourself in
3492875 the water is right there in the oceans the mountains have been pushed up fossils could happen no other way than a worldwide flood what there is no evidence of is millions of years please provide some
3492876 the chalk layer was not my quote but comes from
3492877 he provided not even a pic of a transitional fossil or a link where one can be viewed
3492878 heres a whole list of alleged transitionals not a real one in the bunch just drawings kinda like what we find in the museums fake monkeys with feet and absurd whales with legs
3492879 the mt st helens volcanic flood did produce exactly what we see at the grand canyon complete with thousands of polystrate upright trees
3492880 theres not always the same material for the layers and so we have short layers non conformaties something evolution uniformitarians have no explaination for if there were millions of years between each age of the geo column they should be the same all over the planet but they are not the geological column is another textbook fiction
3492881 im not interested in opinions i want lab testable scientific fact as how these happened if it is your opinion that everything was just a bunch of local floods over millions of years science doesnt support your opinion for the stated reasons there is no erosion there are polystrate fossils there is a universal chalk layer the best youve come up with so far is to deny they even exist
3492882 the water is right there in the oceans the mountains have been pushed up fossils could happen no other way than a worldwide flood what there is no evidence of is millions of years please provide some
3492883 this lack of agreement between field observation and uniformitarian expectation has led to conflict among specialists in the ranks of the larger earth science community
3492884 the chalk layer was not my quote but comes from
3492885 he provided not even a pic of a transitional fossil or a link where one can be viewed
3492886 heres a whole list of alleged transitionals not a real one in the bunch just drawings kinda like what we find in the museums fake monkeys with feet and absurd whales with legs

3492890 well thats because theres missing part of the evelutionary chain
3492891 bj i dont know what your religious beliefs are claimed to be but there is no theistic evolution old earth
3492892 i point this out for a couple reasons but the main is that there is a marxist nwo political agenda pushing evolution in the schools and controlled media
3492893 if you had followed the links you would know that fossils form rapidly and the textbooks are simply in error at best or deceiving most likely when flood sediments cover an object they fossilize rapidly and can be observed doing so repeatedly ap article

3492900 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3492901 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3492902 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3492903 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3492904 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3492905 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3492906 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3492907 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3492908 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3492909 unfortunately you risk injury every time you go out on the field
3492910 weve lost guys in shorts out here for the year with acls

3492912 ive lost a lot of guys in pre season over the years
3492913 any time you lose starting players during the pre season its tough but sometimes theres not much difference between the first and second game losing a guy

3492925 we want it to feel comfortable like youre at home
3492926 we jumped in our car and drove to the polaris store to see it we were so excited
3492927 to say i was shocked is an understatement my moms reaction was my favorite i called her as soon as i found out and all i heard was gasping on the other end of the phone she finally choked out that she was so excited she couldnt speak
3492928 i know im going to be blown away ive never been anywhere in asia and cant wait to experience the dynamics of the chinese culture im not expecting anything just so looking forward to having this brand new mind blowing once in a lifetime experience
3492929 i was a gymnast my whole life and coached as well so of course im dying to see a gymnastics event but really seeing any sport at the olympic level will be an incredible experience maybe something a little more unusual like speed walking that could be fun
3492930 of course we want to see the great wall tiananmen square the silk street markets i also am really looking forward to eating authentic chinese cuisine
3492931 im soaking up all the information i can on china on the olympics athletes that will be there ive learned more about china in the past two weeks than i ever would have otherwise
3492932 i was completely shocked and blown away i also felt extremely humbled and honored when i told my mom she said i think im going to cry my family is really excited for me though and i think a bit envious
3492933 i used to be a swimmer so it would be really interesting to see a swimming event or gymnastics but i think seeing any olympic event would be pretty amazing
3492934 i think she had all of us so pulled into her personal narrative that we could almost feel some of her experiences she was great now i feel like i have an insight into what olympians have gone through their whole lives and into what they are going through at the moment of their event it will make seeing them perform that much more meaningful
3492935 i would love to see the biggies the great wall the forbidden city and tiananmen square ive always wanted to go to china though so seeing anything will be great
3492936 well ive definitely been reading and researching a lot about the olympics and china and trying to learn a bit of chinese also my co workers in the denver office were nice enough to put our little jing jing olympic mascot on my desk now they want me to bring back tons of jing jing paraphernalia for everyone in the office
3492937 id never felt my heart beat so hard in my life it still doesnt feel like im actually going my family was in disbelief and they are extremely excited for me my dad calls me about every other day with a new article hes cut out for me about beijing and the games
3492938 i truly dont know what to expect other than lots of people ive never been to asia before so this will be an entirely new culture on top of the fact that ill be attending the olympics
3492939 i would love to see swimming and gymnastics but even table tennis would be pretty fascinating
3492940 she was incredible and one of my first thoughts after winning the trip was that id get to meet her again over there her speech at ef was truly inspiring i wanted to stand up and cheer

3492960 but if voters approve the triangle cancer patients will someday have more treatment options we will be able to leverage tens of millions of dollars in private donations and new federal grants to the ku cancer clinical research center

3492970 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3492971 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3492972 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3492973 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3492974 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia

3492993 the difference in mental health outcomes between child soldiers and never conscripted children can be explained in part by greater exposure to traumatic events among child soldiers especially for general psychological difficulties and function impairment
3492994 the study has several clinical and programmatic implications first the greater burden of mental health problems among former child soldiers supports the need for focused programming which should include but not consist solely of interventions to reduce depression symptoms and the psychological sequelae of trauma especially bombings and torture as well as incorporate belongingness and income generation second girl soldiers may require focused attention possibly for factors not addressed in this study such as problems of sexual violence and reintegration difficulties third the variation in type and severity of mental health problems highlights the importance of screening including locally developed measures of function impairment as a base for intervention
3492995 without screening there is a risk of pathologizing child soldiers as a group rather than providing support to those individuals most impaired finally the presence of mental health problems among never conscripted children illustrates the need for comprehensive postconflict community based psychosocial care not restricted only to child soldiers

3493010 i wrote the endangered species act and seeing it signed into law was among my proudest moments as a member of congress the changes sought by the bush administration would seriously weaken the law eliminating the requirement that scientists be the ones making decisions regarding science instead giving political hacks and unsympathetic bureaucrats another opportunity to attack the scientific community it is remarkable that this bill signed into law by richard m nixon and accepted for decades as a pillar of american conservation would be destroyed by george w bush in the final months of his administration it is most peculiar that a statute which has done so much good should be now jeopardized by the stroke of a hostile presidential pen

3493204 in 2001 we were just going through the motions and the sense of urgency wasnt there
3493205 we went into that year and our training camp was so much easier and we thought we were a lot better than we were
3493206 its different this year every time ive been on a team that has won there has been a sense of urgency and i feel the sense of urgency here when ive been on a team that thinks were really good we end up doing really bad i think every team that has been successful has had something to prove and we do hopefully we can keep that edge we have a lot of people doubting us already thats good in a sense because its going to help keep us down to earth
3493207 i think that everyone is competing hard and i think we have a lot of ways to go
3493208 i dont think anybody was really happy with the way we played against detroit a 13 10 loss so hopefully we will come out and have a lot better week than we did last week
3493209 its always fun because youre always with a new team you have to get to know your teammates and stuff like that so its always new
3493210 you still catch the ball after practice and sit in the ice tub which is something i dont really enjoy but its something in camp that you have get used to
3493211 i dont really like the new force out rule because if they want to see points on the board its going to take away a lot of catches
3493212 i think its going to be more of an advantage to the defense
3493213 i think its fixing something that doesnt really need to be fixed i didnt think there was a big problem with the force out rule its a fair rule if you could come down in bounds it should be a judgment call on whether you can stay in but now they are taking the judgment away from everybody
3493214 i feel uncomfortable but he burress has proven that he can do it without practicing i just hope that eli manning is able to keep the timing down with him the interesting thing is going to be getting that timing back since the both of us have missed some time
3493215 im definitely excited to see whats going to go on this year
3493216 we have a lot of change on our team a lot of young guys that need to take the place of people that did really well last year and we have some free agents as well that have to come in and do well

3493223 he had a little girl which he is excited about reynolds that one is tough for me to talk about he had like 18 plays and now he is out not good
3493224 he has worked hard and hes getting better every day
3493225 he had a couple of natural up high shots today and he did well with it
3493226 a day or two ago he told me that he thought today would be the day but i dont know its very frustrating it is for the player too i mean hes here for a reason and he had such great expectations unfortunately the way it works in this game he had his best practice and then thats the last time i saw him

3493263 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3493264 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3493265 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3493266 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3493267 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3493273 the general economic slowdown and consequent customer demand shifts continue to be a major challenge for the customers of our contract manufacturing sector who are predominately consumer products marketers while for the first three quarters of fiscal year 2008 we have been successful in generating financial results better than fiscal year 2007 despite the economic downturn we will achieve lower sales and net income in the fourth quarter comparable to a year ago when our contract manufacturing sector had the benefit of both stronger retail demand and two simultaneous new product launches we have had success in bringing in several new customers and will start up significant new customer wipes projects early in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 we are also anticipating actively competing in the manufacturing of canister wipes for both existing and new customers when our recently announced canister line becomes operational in the spring of 2009 our business imaging sector which sells primarily to distributors who focus on the restaurant convenience store and hospitality industries is also experiencing the negative impact on those industries associated with the general economic slowdown but we anticipate improvements in that sector through fiscal 2009 as initiatives with new customers and new products take hold
3493274 broyhill is the perfect place to launch this strategy at the brand level
3493275 broyhills customer base ranges from single location independent dealers to national accounts the consultative fact based sales approach that is the foundation of the wow strategy works with customers at every level and we maximize the upside leverage of this proven sales strategy by starting with broyhill
3493276 mark has been the point person for rolling the wow strategy out to furniture brands five national account teams and their early success has been impressive he has also been very involved with broyhill in our strategy sessions and the work that we have accomplished with our account base it just made great sense to leverage his knowledge and experience to lead the broyhill sales team in fully implementing the wow strategy
3493277 we thank don for his contributions to broyhill and wish him success in his return to his west coast roots
3493278 during the second quarter we experienced strong results and took further steps to implement our growth strategies in the river business we have increased the volumes loaded and we see strong demand for key commodities we expanded our river business fleet currently in operation by 57 barges and three pushboats during the course of the second quarter and now have a total of 591 barges with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1 020 000 dwt while we continued to vigorously build and equip our new barge construction yard the most modern of its kind in south america which we expect to have in full production in 2009 in our offshore supply business we continue to position ourselves to capitalize on the strong fundamentals of this market and currently have seven vessels under construction which will more than double our existing fleet in our ocean business revenues were up 169 due to increased charter rates on our obos and the addition of the capesize vessel princess marisol and the product tankers amadeo and austral to our ocean fleet finally during the quarter we made a strategic decision to sell our only passenger vessel the blue monarch
3493279 during the quarter we continued to access the lending markets to support our growth strategy specifically we signed a 12 year secured term loan of up to 93 6 million for pre delivery and post delivery financing of the four psvs under construction in india this agreement underscores both our support from leading banks and commitment to growing the business going forward as previously announced during the quarter we bought back 274 days in cleared ffas covering the third and fourth quarters of 2008 while simultaneously selling 274 days in otc ffas for these same periods the economic and accounting effect of these transactions was almost neutral and significantly reduced our future working capital requirements while enabling us to remain in a position to receive stable and visible cash flows and benefit from the upside potential in our ocean business
3493280 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3493281 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3493282 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3493300 never to speak about oneself is a very noble piece of hypocrisy talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself
3493301 we delivered a solid first quarter despite operating in a very challenging environment
3493302 our year over year improvement is largely due to a strong performance by our food products business positive same store sales at bob evans and effective cost management in our restaurant segment
3493303 our first quarter same store sales at bob evans reflect a strong consumer response to our promotions including big farm salads and two new knife and fork sandwiches as well as our bob b q baby back ribs and oven roasted chicken
3493304 at mimis cafe our new management team has launched just enough lunch and dinner menus that feature right sized right priced entrees we are also changing our cost structure so we can build the mimis brand with more traditional advertising
3493305 our labor reduction efforts throughout fiscal 2009 and 2008 are paying dividends as we lowered operating wages as a percentage of net sales despite higher year over year minimum wage rates
3493306 our food products segment continues to post impressive results as we have now produced 26 consecutive quarters of increased comparable pounds sold
3493307 we achieved this years 13 percent increase on top of a 4 percent increase a year ago during the quarter we introduced new natural casing bratwursts italian grilling sausages and a 24 count sausage egg and cheese burrito for wholesale club retailers

3493318 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3493319 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first

3493332 scalia is trying to understand whether co2 emissions fall under the existing air pollution laws and guess what they dont
3493333 clearly they dont this is not a judgement on the science as a whole but whether co2 falls into that category the acid rain point is a good one but again 1 the chemical in question was the result of man made activity not a common pre existing component 2 the effects were measurable and 3 eliminating the problem would have a measurable effect like it or not even the full success of this lawsuit would have only the most trivial and meaningless impact on the airs co2 content why should the court impose a pointless burden

3493342 weve taken some big steps in the last month in this tournament and throughout our warm ups and now have the chance to build on this momentum
3493343 weve come a long way but it takes experience to get comfortable with winning
3493344 our performances may help us break into other international tournaments and start amassing the amount of international experience you need to be physically and mentally prepared for games like this
3493345 we know that new zealand football are 100 percent behind the womens game and we hope to get the backing of sparc and the nzoc again in the future
3493346 the belief of the players has shifted and thats half the battle
3493347 that may take three years but if we keep investing in the team then we can reach our goal of reaching the quarter finals of the 2011 world cup and the quarter finals of the olympics in 2012
3493348 new teacher didint know how hard to teach class eventually he made it easier however he is not very clear and does not explain in depth about how to formulate proofs part of the problem is the large amount of material and scarce class time and his english is not very good he is a new teacher and gave us very hard homeworks and mid term at the beginning of the semester but the difficulity of works change to much more normal now his explanation is good and clear you can learn a lot and know how to think about math if you pay attention in his class
3493349 dagan is an awesome dude a clear lecturer and pretty much the most laid back professor ive ever encountered only complaint class may have been a little too easy what follows in the field of analysis isnt as neat and tidy as it happens in ross the text the dage chose but thats a fault of the text dagan is still totally groovy
3493350 shes the harshest grader ever no curves it would be really hard to get an a in her class but her lectures are awesome incredible teacher she knows the material extremely well her lectures are crystal clear and memorized she uses no notes she is very nice and approachable at office hours she holds students to a high standard but her lectures are so perfect that a textbook is barely necessary i probably could have gotten a better grade with a different professor but i definitely would not have learned nearly as much as i did
3493351 excellent professor very clear with his lectures very good handwriting he makes sure that you understand everything and is extremely helpful during office hours tests are fair and reflect the material well
3493352 teacher never showed any enthusiasm never asked for class participation nor showed any interest in if student were understanding he talks to the chalkboard from the second you walk in until after the class is over never changing his plan if students are struggling unresponsive unhelpful most of the time i think this is mainly becuase he is a new professor he seemed extremeley tense nervous while lecturing midsemester he reprimanded students for not participating yet he seemed annoyed when anyone asked a question
3493353 i attempted this course last semester with a different professor and could not understand the course
3493354 he is definitely very very very very hard for me anyway but yes he is one of the nicest and most helpful professors in oh too bad i found that out kind of late in the semester hes an excellent lecturer who is thorough and challenges his students very hard and unhelpful leaves you on your own i have to retake the class
3493355 this professor must never be allowed to teach mathematics again
3493356 seems to prefer vague analogies to proof homework is rarely applicable to tests difficulty of class varies from day to day bad board etiquette not interested in group theory which makes him an unusual choice for 113 if you want a professor who is impossible to understand who goes straight out of the book so you have no other sources of information at the end you will spend hours in your gsis office hours trying together trying to decipher what he was talking about oh yeah and the class is not curved have fun avoid at all costs
3493357 office hours consist of a student asking a question followed by a 5 second silence followed by at most five words spoken by vojta followed by more awkward silence and finally repeat number of repititions depend on how many students are present out of touch with undergrad students terrible at answering questions if hes your only choice well you can wait a semester told us that material wouldnt be on a test then put it on said test
3493358 freshman seminar about myths of archeology she runs sites in nemea and mycenae so really interesting to talk about what archeology is really like assignments due every week usu writing responses about different readings but able to do them w o reading just talk in class and youll be fine
3493359 he hands out readings works that he wrote however we never even discussed them each class was just sort of open to anything just one essay at the end it was just a seminar but i was struck by how disorganized it was im not sure if his other classes are more organized theres a reason professor mchombo gets nothing but rave reviews from his students hes the very definition of a great guy and hes very knowledgeable you wont find a nicer friendlier professor or person on campus fun class learned a lot wanna take it again mchombo for president
3493360 he is a very funny guy however his lectures are kinda boring and hard to understand professor berck is a wonderful professor but his lectures can be very difficult to understand very funny kind sharp guy immensely experienced and knowledgeable sometimes doesnt communicate well with students in terms of understanding what their problems are what they arent getting
3493361 jb is a hottie impossible to follow plus you cant read his handwriting
3493362 dont go to lectures they are boring and pointless lectures are pointless mostly just him going off on some random tangent completely unrelated to the course do not go to lectures they are random and completely irrelevant to the test material guest lecturers were interesting and informative his lecturing skills are poor and hes definitely a weirdo but he means well and is a nice guy
3493363 he is a very unclear lecturer hes from the demog department so he only brings in graphs tables has little knowledge of soc theory and doesnt answer questions well hes very enthusiastic and not at all interested in a homogeneous education path for his students i would recommend his class just for his lectures and his jumping around on tables an insecure man who should not be teaching what could be such an informative course how does he still have a job
3493364 always came to class with a lot of energy and enthusiasm very funny love the spanish accent knows his stuff and the class is very enjoyable at times he can seem intimidating but he likes participation estaba en su seminar sobre la cinema espanola buen clase peliculas interesantes y es un profesor muy animado y agradable tiene mi recomendacion
3493365 this guy was great clear explanations humorous and did helpful example problems in lecture exams are hard but the grading scale is very generous mean 3 4 as opposed to 2 7 in 61abc once youve finished cs 61abc as i have youll realise that cs3 was a cake walk and prof titterton is one of the better profs in the department not a particularly interesting lecturer although the lectures are actually unnecessary so do not worry about it if you have prior computer experience take this class only if you want an easy a or do not have the time to devote to cs61a either way make sure to read the book as it is a good introduction to cs nates a great guy and he really made cs feel less analytical tedious etc and more dynamic creative humorous hes also really funny
3493366 his presentation style was fairly boring basically he read from pp slides all day in a slightly monotonous voice absolutely riveting great project too great lecturer
3493367 clarification by l i mean the six hour lab vers of cs61b that is clancys pet creation hes very nice and willing to help if he happens to be wandering through your lab or if you go to his office hours however he assigns a lot of ridiculously hard homework and projects are difficult one hr wk lectures ineffective tests reasonable a very cool professor who gets to know his students very well makes course material very interesting definitely recommended
3493368 hardest prof i have ever had at berkeley challenged me to the limits and beyond he is funny helpful and unusually clear and i say unusually because ee classes are hard to understand hes brilliant articulate personable and an excellent lecturer truly one of the best bonzai
3493369 just an average lecturer nice professor though dont like his powerpoint presentations lectures can be quite boring sometimes exams are difficult though just looking at his slides wont cut it youll have to listen to his lectures carefully and really understand the material as well as know a whole lot to do well on his tricky questions he is extremely helpful in office hours in answering questions he is also very clear on emphasizing what is important for the exams would advise future students to take your own notes for his section though because his lecture slides are next to useless when youre studying
3493370 feldman is a wonderful teacher with a committment to undergraduates he genuinely cares about students and learning the material go talk to him during office hours and you might actually start to like plants i love plants tricky midterm with only 32 questions miss two answers and you cant get an a but all very reasonable questions he is totally accessible and visits all the lab sections if you go to lectures watch the webcasts and take notes you can get an a without touching the book wants students to understand concepts so he asks a lot of hypothetical questions on midterms he writes everything down clearly and you just need to memorize what he writes test seems easy but when you get it back you may find that you made a few mistakes
3493371 heavy accent and cannot explain anything you learn by doing the homework which is tedious and reading the book his tests were poorly written but i was able to manage the class because of discussion and i had a bad ass gsi chem 1a would definitely be challenging if you havent taken it in high school however it is totally doable like the people said before take advantage of the extra credit study with your peers and look at his old tests they are really helpful as someone else has already mentioned take advantage of the gimme points there are around 400 of them you get extra credit for going to lecture your gsi is definitely the key to a high grade so pay attention and ask questions in lab
3493372 weird class he tried to get us interested in studying crystals by saying that they would improve our sex life the material is very simple but he likes to add random tangents textbook is awful office hours are useless because he just talks about his kids fun guy fun class saykally gives interesting lectures and tries to incorporate recent advances in chemistry into the course material as lower division science courses go this one isnt too hard tests are usually fair good interesting lecturer included lots of information about modern scientific applications he also blew things up a lot first 3 mid terms werent hard and followed his practice tests closely however his final was very difficult tip facts in lecture that dont seem important e g the entire c n o cycle energy use statistics will show up
3493373 professor frechet is a great teacher who makes the material interesting and easy to remember with somewhat lame but weirdly funny jokes mixed in with the material
3493374 put off taking this class to get pedersen if you have to dont bother with the text but always go to lecture he really does teach the concepts and hes even funny sometimes one of the best professors ive had not easy but excellent i had all three of the main ochem professors frechet vollhardt and pedersen for different classes and theres no doubt that pederson is 1 his lectures are very clear and hes the only one who can lecture the hardest subject in a way so that anyone can understand so if you are going to take a hard class this professor is the one if you work hard it is easy to get a b but unless you are exceptional it is very difficult to get an a hes funny nice extremeley smart barely uses text emphasizes amino acids more than other o chem professors which is good for bio people only real flaw is that he rushes certain parts of the course and takes other parts very slow
3493375 this class was unbelievably boring it seems to me he would take forever copying a sample problem from the book to the board and then go through the solution in half a second his meek presentation style does not help raise interest one of the best profs ive ever had i dreaded taking physics before but golightlys such a great profs that i dont hate physics as much now very clear and helpful his demos are interesting too especially when they fail professor golightly is the sweetest physics professor hes dorky and enthusiastic the tests are pretty easy because they are almost exactly like the review sheets he is definitely dedicated to his students exams are pretty easy but just be aware that he can only give out so many as so youve got to work hard
3493376 he is inexperienced and it shows he spends a lot of time on demos and sometimes gets flustered however that being said he is extremely enthusiastic and wants it to be fun for his students his midterms are relatively easy and the text good enough to learn what he doesnt cover well in lecture he has a great personality and is actually pretty funny besides the occasional jokes his lectures are boring because they are so hard to follow hes pretty unorganized isnt all that great at explaining and doesnt spend time on concepts that need to be explained however his midterms were pretty straightforward and relatively easy horrible teaching does not know what hes doing on the board confusing textbook confusing homework confusing lectures straight up horrible deweese is a first year professor and it is quite noticeable in his teaching however he is really nice and the homework and the book are great teaching tools he allows you to have cheat sheet and for never having taken physics the first midterm seemed easy compared to the other class there is no curve so everyone is pretty friendly
3493377 this class was the easiest science class i have ever taken lecture is pretty useless and boring discussion was the most helpful if you have a good gsi he assigns 45 problems from the book for each exam and chooses around 8 10 which makes it easy to get a good grade if you do the problems theres no curve but its really not needed he assigns you exam problems in advance and then picks a few changes them and that is your test about 50 problems per midterm and 140 for the final so the days before the tests are painful you dont learn any physics since the problems are so difficult you just memorize them lecture is useless but his demos are cool discussion can be helpful absolutely horrible teaches 8b at a 7b level despite 8b not being a calculus based class his teaching style depends almost entirely on calc derivations lecture is pointless and his unenthusiastic comportment makes this class almost unbearable this class got a lot better about halfway through he started to use powerpoint and he put his slides on the web mostly also stopped deriving everything the book we used was useless
3493378 i thought that he was a pretty good lecturer most peopel thoguth he was super easy because they took physics in high school and never went to lecture he sometimes goes into tangents but overall his tests are fair gives tons of partial credit and as long as you try to keep up in class youll be able to do well in the class professor falcone is pretty boring but he totally has fake hands seriously and grades easy has a passion for physics and his demos are interesting tangents sometimes and loses concentration a bit but overall hes a great lecturer his tests are pretty hard tho but he gives tons of partial credit and his grading scale is excellent makes physics fun and interesting
3493379 he does not do a good job of choosing text books or homework assignments usually lectures are written at 2 am the night before the class nice guy and helpful in office hours but boardwork needs to improve
3493380 does his job well perhaps the best in the department the most efficient in conveying knowledge if he is teaching a classand you have the option of taking it do so however do not take the class lightly grades to 7 8 5 meaning a 0 b 0 c d f he prepares for lectures in ahead and his hws would surely lead students to understanding the materials he teaches i was impressed his hws more than his lecture although his lecture is very well organized with neat writings on a blackboard by the way you would not use the optics book much so you do not have to buy it if you dont want it easily the best professor of my undergraduate career go talk to him in oh he has plenty of entertaining and usually applicable stories very difficult conceptually but you are trying to actually learn something arent you
3493381 hes extremely arrogant and very rarily in the lab thinks youre an idiot will be happy to talk about his mit education but in reality im not very impressed with him
3493382 very enthusiastic explains very good lectures are very organized and are a big help with the lab reports
3493383 simply amazing he will go out of his way to help you
3493384 very nice guy and explains clearly to detail his midterms were at about the same level as the homework so they were actually doable and they make you feel good about physics but his final was unspeakably hard feel like i could have a different evaluation because of the final he is very clear and his lecture notes are very helpful his tests are about the same as the homework level a very insightful and fair professor
3493385 he is truly one of the most caring professors ive ever met at cal his class definitely emphasizes understanding the concepts rather than just knowing how to do problems focus on his powerpoint notes and he explains things very well in office hours overall he is a wonderful old man very genuine and kind perhaps the best professor ive had at berkeley the tests are not very hard he puts half application problems and half book problems on the test as a person he is an extremely caring and kind person he truly cares about his students if youre going to take his class i highly recommend getting to know him hes awesome
3493386 he is fair and a great lecturer homeworks were very demanding each week often 10 15 hours of work for a problem set tests were pretty hard overall a cool professor he was an excellent professor in quantum mechanics very clear showed interest and encouraged students to ask questions there was never a dull moment in his class he can be demanding the final exam was the hardest test ive taken at cal yet he was an excellent professor in quantum mechanics very clear showed interest and encouraged students to ask questions there was never a dull moment in his class he can be demanding the final exam was the hardest test ive taken at cal yet an amazing lecturer heavily encourages questions during lecture and answers them as much as possible within the time constraint his exams can be difficult
3493387 amazing lecturer rigorous presentation that is never vague or evasive
3493388 even though i came in with an excited attitude to take this class prof souza made it a nightmare in my opinion it is excusable for a prof to be mediocre as long as he tries this guy doesnt care at all about students and i wouldnt be surprised if he really doesnt care about physics his lectures are bad regurgitations of an already bad textbook really no point in attending not to mention he cant even answer questions he often tries to be a hardline professor but he comes off as being mean ex wont let you miss a homework even if you have a good reason all told a very bad experience hes not even a very nice guy
3493389 overall a pretty good professor his lectures are clear and well organized hes really nice in office hours and exams are hard but fair extremely friendly and enthusiastic very approachable challenging but fair tests sometimes not great at explaining more difficult material but overall an awesome professor like a big warm cuddly physics teaching teddy bear entertaining classes though reading the book is very important to follow him through some of the harder materials
3493390 really nice very smart amp experienced but has had a stroke so his handwriting is very hard to read and his lecturing is completely disorganized makes frequent mistakes goes off on tangents amp the midterms are badly worded confusing read the book amp go to discussions and you should be fine hell explain anything if you take the time to ask davis is a very nice guy and you know he likes and loves what he does but as a teacher who is responsible for upper level education he lacks in clarity structure and fails to present the material in an interesting yet alone comprehensible manner i loved astro b4 this class but not nemore lots of useless homework reading
3493391 great lecturer very clear and neat tests range from straightforward to very difficult but if you are comfortable with the math multivariable calculus differential equations most of the material will make conceptual sense even if some of the questions do not a very good professor very boring lectures but thats physics does his best to make the material interesting some of the demos are cool with the exception of the first midterm tests are hard the class is heavily curved so it is possible to do far less than stellar and still secure at least an a do not take this class at 8 am the first midterm was easy enough mean in the 80s the second was killer mean in the 40s my advice is to work on understanding concepts at a deep level and focus primarily on the hardest problems in the book better screw up in the comfort of your own home than on your final boggs is great and if youre not at least he curves
3493392 was a fair professor the accent was not bad compared to other professors does make an effort to go at the students pace if enough people voice their opinion if you have a problem voice it because she will listen midterms are not easy but the curve makes it all better great teacher the accent may be a little hard at first pay attention to examples she gives in class they are sometimes very similar to her test shes the type of professor that if you treat them with respect they will in turn respect you prof lanzaras lectures were pretty straight forward the midterms are hard ok though but the final was much much harder but do all the problems in the book and you should be fine a word of advice check out old exams from other colleges like mit cornell caltech etc i saw a few very similar problems on her midterms
3493393 wow prof packard is awesome and he teaches in a way for the student to actually understand his class was at 8 in the morning and every time i went i never went to sleep thats how great the lecture was i definitely recommend taking him great lecturer he goes over the most important topics in class and goes over them in great detail i love how when he goes over a concept he tells a story about it about its discovery or an interesting use of the concept in technology this means he does not lecture on parts of the reading but he takes questions on them also great demos great lecturer tries very hard to clarify difficult concepts good demos done in class he tends to digress a lot but that just made the class more interesting midterms arent very difficult the second one was actually pretty easy final wasnt bad since 3 of the problems were taken from the homework overall excellent professor
3493394 awesome professor great lectures with really cool demos lectures are organized and handwriting is neat tests are extremely hard really takes some thinking as well as creativity but overall it was a good experience you have to pay attention in this class but its not hard to he goes over material nice and slow and has one of the most presentable drawings and handwriting ive seen in years the tests are extremely difficult so prepare to study he wants his students to know what theyre doing just work and youll do fine man such a good teacher i think he is the best professor in the physics department so please take his class you might regret if you dont have him
3493395 good professor follows the material in the book and explains it very well
3493396 physically he looks like the turtle master from dragon ball z psycologically he is a funny chinese guy without a thick accent overall good guy his lectures focus a lot on proofs and complicated math the example problems he does in class are very difficult to follow discussion sections are much more helpful than lecture i feel like hes almost too smart to be teaching intro physics because when he answers questions it tends to only confuse me more nice guy no accent lectures are mostly derivations that are not useful discussions are a lot more useful labs were mostly worksheets midterms final were on the diffcult side hey what do you expect its physics but still reasonable and the curve ensures that if you do the work it shouldnt be too hard to end up with a b
3493397 overall horrible class and definitely worth waiting to take if marco is the only one teaching it that semester his tests were completely different than anything wed seen in hw or class i learned nothing from his lectures and wasnt prepared for my upper division classes that were based in the quantum from this class accent takes some getting used to lectures were interesting and he was good at connecting the topics together tests were difficult but hes very helpful if you ask him questions some test questions were on topics from lecture that werent in the textbooks hes friendly in office hours and will walk you through problems or concepts class was ridiculous the mean on one of our tests was like a 30 only savior was looking at previous midterms for hours book was not too helpful in this class avoid really cool class in my opinion the material was really dense so i suppose theres no easy way to teach it battaglia is a particle physicist and he incorporated his research into his lectures tests twas really hard at first but you can learn alot from his class
3493398 took physics amp music in spring 07 was his 2nd semester teaching ever
3493399 he was a very kind and clear lecturer he seems to care about his students and adjusted homework to a reasonable amount his exams were challenging but he seems to grade fairly the only thing was that he went through a lot of material within a single semester one of the easiest professor in berkeley

3493401 are too big of a case for you to deal with
3493402 dinner for lunch a trader joes gem and omega 3s
3493403 hes a fun teacher but he gets easily sidetracked with silly pointless analogies his midterm and portion of the final was tough but if you studied i didnt you can manage a good grade dont know if it was just his section acids and bases of the class or him but i thought that out of the three professors he explained his material the best he did deviate from the book and expected students to use his methods and equations on the test but by going to class and paying attention you can learn a lot and do well on the exams
3493404 the homeworks were never explained well and i did pretty bad but there are many opportunities to overcome that problem i didnt opt to go for them nonetheless if you are somewhat dedicated to doing well in the class you will do well great professor one of my favorites at berkeley he spends a lot of time on his students and gives them lots of attention he gives great guidance and gives fair homework and exams you have to love this guy
3493405 best instructor i had at cal tests are difficult lectures are detailed nothing tricky about the class but you are expected to know what you are talking about cant bullcrap your way through
3493406 professor bayen is one of the most enthusiastic professors i have had the pleasure of taking a class with as i meet more and more faculty in his area of research one thing i constantly hear is how bright he is and i totally agree he has a great presentation style and a sense of humor that will keep lectures interesting
3493407 he expects too much though and can mistakenly find something to be easy it would be better for him to stay in the real world and not teach he has a lot of difficulty explaining an idea in laymans terms and ends up just technobabbling about the math which makes no sense i stopped going to lecture as it just made things worse his online reader is confusing as well and goes too much into the math theory rather than the relevance to programming do not take this class with patzek you will regret it forever and ever and ever heed this warning lest you rot in eternal damnation
3493408 talks fast odd mannerisms thinks alot of himself khaki pants blue shirt navy red tie everyday has an overly inflated opinion of himself and engineering as the only important major on earth way to eager to have you think he is a good guy pompus tough teacher know his stuff though but a jerk
3493409 he seems like hes straight out of the 60s very whimsical man and very interesting to listen to take this class if youre into philosophy i came away from it with a new outlook on life an amazing thought provoking inspired man he cares about his students take this class and go to his office hours you wont regret it
3493410 in lecture she simplifies the material too much like shes teaching to little kids you dont realize its a problem until you start the homework and youre like how the eff do you do this would not recommend daaaaaaammmmmnnnn she is a hotty she kinda looks like dobby from harry potter though darth mcmains homeworks took way too long did not inform us on how to do required material extremely long midterms all around poor teacher take it with any other professor she is also extremely stingy when it comes to any kind of grading
3493411 one of my all time favorite professors is willing to help with homeworks and projects grasps the interest of students great teacher makes subject very interesting his lectures are kinda unorganized and he doesnt follow the book so you need to attend
3493412 shes the harshest grader ever no curves it would be really hard to get an a in her class but her lectures are awesome incredible teacher she knows the material extremely well her lectures are crystal clear and memorized she uses no notes she is very nice and approachable at office hours she holds students to a high standard but her lectures are so perfect that a textbook is barely necessary i probably could have gotten a better grade with a different professor but i definitely would not have learned nearly as much as i did
3493413 very fun awesome lecture also a very fair grader i dont mean easy i just mean fair very willing to answer questions she goes too quick most of the time but possible to follow if you take good notes tests were very hard in the sense you have to apply what was covered i couldnt understand anything she was saying and gave up the 2nd week of class he goes fast at times but if you make the effort to read ahead you should be fine go to office hours grace rains over her head as she willing accepts late homework and extra credit assignments her class is challenging but not insanely difficult
3493414 true his handwriting is not great but its better than mine also he says pretty much what he writes so keep your ears open and hell answer your questions his handwriting is horrible you wont be able to read anything but then again he was extremely knowledgable in his field im guessing office hours would be helpful he cant communicate by words board or anything my worst class ever
3493415 very nice guy easy going he seriously knows his stuff goes to lecture without book notes and teaches it straight from memory theorems and proofs tests are straight forward homeworks are doable very nice teacher generally clear though at times gives in to handwaving test grading is peculiar in that his midterm was worth 5 points i sure hope the final is not worth 10 p very helpful
3493416 you wont learn numerical analysis from his classes he assumes you know absolutely nothing and will go at an alarmingly slow pace 1 3 1 2 of his class didnt attend lecture for good reason insists on using horrible text not very encouraging in oh either but easy test avoid if possible his tests are relatively easy which screws up the curve i attended lectures for the first 2 3 of the course and didnt go anymore after the 1 3 since i never looked at my lecture notes anyway the class in general was horribly horribly organized i cannot emphasize this enough beware
3493417 i actually had him as an academic advisor he gives it to you straight without holding anything back which is good to some people but dont look to him for encouragement i would avoid taking undergrad courses with him he may be better for graduate level work one of the best teachers ive had in my life
3493418 this professor must never be allowed to teach mathematics again
3493419 prof scanlon is a total babe and his teaching methods arent bad either all in all hes a friendly guy who genuinely wants us to understand the concepts presented in class sigh and that darn bow tie when i went to lecture i made myself go once a week i would leave more confused than when i came in i relied entirely on the book horrible teacher hard tests as well an overall great professor who makes witty jokes few truly appreciate considering its a boring subject he tries his best to make it interesting class was not very difficult at all
3493420 excellent professor very clear with his lectures very good handwriting he makes sure that you understand everything and is extremely helpful during office hours tests are fair and reflect the material well
3493421 homework is sporadic and often pointless exams are difficult with medians under 50 uses the textbook he wrote with another professor but often ignores proofs in the text for his own class presentation the class is lethally dry in the beginning and improves only near the very end of the class making you wish for a two semester sequence
3493422 i love professor wus teaching style his lectures are very organized and engaging he makes sure the students understand before moving onto next subject homework is related to the test and with reasonable amount often criticizes high school math education in the states and it gives much motivation to me as a future teacher
3493423 how funny is it that im sitting here for the first time in my career as an extra only weeks after receiving a star on the walk of fame im certainly in great company though with loni anderson melissa manchester and army archerd
3493424 so could you tell us what this meeting is about like we could get to our usual free time

3493429 oh yeah but now we have to choose what we have to take with us we could just have one bag with us
3493430 dont be so sure about that demy xemnas is probably gonna make us look after those stupid nobodies
3493431 whatever the best thing is that we could do whatever we want until xemnas make us look after those nobodies
3493432 hey guys what should we do in the city i dont want to be there and just be there without any planning

3493443 sorry if you got any better idea i really wont to hear it
3493444 cool they looks like ants maybe i could see hayner olette and pence

3493449 hey how about football me demyx and alexandrax against you guys
3493450 uh xemnas the others have played football and almost destroyed the whole bus
3493451 you know you arent allowed to play football in the bus
3493452 gigantic experiment i think with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3493453 why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3493454 that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring there is no food in the future
3493455 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3493456 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3493457 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3493458 i think not im terribly sorry its not going backwards it is actually recognising that we are with nature not against it we have gone working against nature for too long
3493459 look at indias green revolution it worked for a short time but now the price is being paid
3493460 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place as result of the over demand on irrigation because of the hybrid seeds and grains that have been produced which demand huge amounts of water
3493461 the water table has disappeared they have huge problems with water level with pesticide problems and complications which are now coming home to roost
3493462 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
3493463 if you are not working with natural assistance you cause untold problems which become very expensive and very difficult to undo it places impossible burdens on nature and leads to accumulating problems which become more difficult to sort out
3493464 youve got to deliver more than words youve got to deliver the world that the words go with
3493465 rezed podcast episode 12 james paul gee on virtual worlds and the power of situated learning
3493466 he is too old to teach really bad and cant teach no no no
3493467 rectors ok not too riveting although you might need to pay a little attention towards the end of the semester very friendly professor tries to be helpful and is tests are reasonable and sometimes on the easy side fun class but challenging labs as long as you do your labs well you will do well in the class as a whole
3493468 i hated this class when i sought help from the professor he chastised me on how i needed to study harder for the test instead of actually helping me terrible he is vague cryptic and stern be prepared do learn all the material on your own his monotone puts me to sleep i had the same experience of being chastised for not putting in enough effort when i went for extra help but i did get the sense he really cared that i pass the class but that is no consolation he is real bad good luck
3493469 professor was very clear he was able to anticipate most students questions and he gives clear examples in class and develops intuitive understanding in most of his students most people in the class that i talked to agreed he gives very good introduction to topics to really motivate things the exams are all very valid to test your knowledge about the subjects do expect to put real work into the class though because his class is not very easy highly recommended professor amazing professor he really knows his material it makes me want to continue in this field i highly recommend his courses
3493470 the smartest man i know excellent professor very passionate about the subject and full of interesting information very friendly and approachable this class was the bright spot in my otherwise awful schedule dazzling intellect and a concern for students not often seen at cal
3493471 very helpful during office hours class notes are useful and a good mix of new research and fundamental material he is well organized with really good and usefull class notes his class is never boring extremely hard professor but forces you to learn the subject everything uses the aci code as reference since he was one of the people who wrote the building code
3493472 it is obvious that professor filippou is in love with himself
3493473 amen to that the class is hard but he is always very helpful during office hours and really cares about the students learning
3493474 professor li is very clear during lectures and is very straightforward about the course hes also a very nice guy i love his analogies comparing beam stability to a person with someone with schizophrenia uses the same tests year after year does some homework problems for you in class not a hard class he is hard to understand and moves quickly if you have to take ce130 it is a must to take li
3493475 going into this class i thought i was going to hate it zohdi turned out to be a great professor very clear explanations very clear expectations of students no regular homework sets interesting lectures and real world examples easily one of the best professors ive had at cal zohdi is easily the best professor ive ever had in berkeley crystal clear explanations repeats everything to the point you have no choice but understand it excellent board use awesome professor there is no way you can dislike this guy
3493476 best instructor i had at cal tests are difficult lectures are detailed nothing tricky about the class but you are expected to know what you are talking about cant bullcrap your way through
3493477 loved this class so extremely easy and she was always so nice about it if you have questions shell help you in a second and she genuinely tries to get to know everyone dont buy the book or the reader just study from the slides love the class prof frick is super nice and helpful during office hour if you are cee major make sure you take this class with her exams are fair and not hard study her powerpoint presentation before the exams they help a lot
3493478 about the only professor in the department with personality awesome professor great personality his lectures always never stay on track usually talking about something else for 1 3 of the time very excited about concrete and homework exams very fair very easy class not a lot of work is required just show up and pay attention during lecture
3493479 a huge spread out city lots of long and clean beaches millions of cars hardly any traffic jams not so many good looking people

3493483 je weet niet wie het ergens voor het zeggen heeft dat maakt het werk van een journalist erg gevaarlijk
3493484 elke vorm van autoriteit ontbreekt in regios als osseti en abchazi en iedereen heeft wapens
3493485 maar we zijn te weinig in zulke gebieden de berichtgeving is te fragmentarisch dat is een extra veiligheidsrisico

3493487 je hoort vaak dat schutters dachten dat de camera een wapen was je kunt je er iets bij voorstellen dat op grote afstand die twee niet even makkelijk te onderscheiden zijn

3493552 alright alright i fucked up i know i fucked up im sorry im so sorry i fucked up
3493553 only became the new benchmark for spears decline it was also the most talked about performance not only of the show but perhaps the year
3493554 im not sure how we top britney opening the show
3493555 look not only to my own interests but also to the interests of others
3493556 i need to go over to beths to help her move some stuff again
3493557 we both know she has a crush on you or whatever it is she exposed her skin to you right in front of me im not a jealous person and youre my boyfriend and shes my best friend but i dont like the idea of you going over there at ten at night at all im not even telling you not to go i just wanted you to know how i feel she responds to you whatever little gesture it is it doesnt matter she takes it as something else and she loves the attention
3493558 why did you send beth a picture of your back i didnt even get one

3493562 he tried that on me to talk about my feelings the other day after pf changs
3493563 you know what youre just mad because you got caught doing whatever you dont need to be doing with my friend like i asked you to
3493564 we needed a strategy to generate new advertising dollars without negatively affecting our traditional print advertising revenue since our launch in may 45 new advertisers have already committed budget to the new site as an extension of their promotional mix
3493565 one of the most appealing aspects of our new initiative is that we have been able to offer an effective promotional platform for smaller businesses that traditionally have not had the time or the resources to develop a web presence or to do any kind of print advertising
3493566 i opened the box and found a diamond ring inside
3493567 her son works two jobs and was going to propose that very day
3493568 he suddenly brought out the ring from behind his back and i just started bawling
3493569 i asked him to follow me over to the bank to give him the 100 reward he wouldnt accept the reward though
3493570 i know my wife would be sick if she lost her ring
3493571 there wasnt anything else to do it wasnt rightfully mine i had to find the owner
3493572 i picked it up wrapped it and never even noticed
3493573 she opened it on christmas morning she put it on and our son noticed it was wrong
3493574 we go to about three games a year and no one ever even mentioned it
3493575 i knew he was going to play for the jets someday
3493576 complexity guru dave snowden is fond of saying at conferences if you want to focus on the future dont start with a taxonomy project because a taxonomy represents your past after all if innovation is about getting out of the box taxonomy work is mostly about putting things into boxes
3493577 kids already spend very little time with their own thoughts this will just make it worse
3493578 but i can search google why do i need you
3493579 do you want to take advice from the man who looked at the batman and robin script and said lets do this

3493581 coins have proved to be more flexible and more negotiable
3493582 you dont pay much more to have a 1oz gold coin than a bar its only a couple of per cent difference in it and its easier to go and sell a one ounce coin any time than a one ounce bar most people you show both items to will take the coin nine times out of 10
3493583 its much easier to produce a forge bar a coin is a little more difficult to do there was never any cases of forged coins
3493584 jewellery you just pay too much for it 18 carat jewellery is sold from 70 to 80 a gram while the actual gold value is 24 with jewellery you are paying for the manufacturing jewellery is not something youd buy to invest in gold
3493585 we see a lot is companies going back to original projects there are some new projects but mostly its old projects that are being repackaged
3493586 theres some important stuff that i want to go through later and then i never have the time to get to it again
3493587 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3493588 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3493589 georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3493590 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3493591 i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and trans atlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship
3493592 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3493593 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3493594 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3493595 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3493596 she picked a flower and put it in her hair
3493597 the olympics are without a doubt the greatest sporting spectacle on earth
3493598 no one could argue that they represent the pinnacle of human physical ability
3493599 so why dilute it with half hearted performances in tennis and basketball or baseball where all of the best players are competing for a more important prize
3493600 likewise the soccer tournament lacks all but a handful of the household names that millions of people flock to week in and week out its time the ioc recognised that for the olympics to remain the pinnacle of sporting excellence these events must be removed
3493601 its an interesting debate regarding what the olympics really mean and i look forward to hearing what everyone else thinks
3493602 canadas medal chances in this event depends on how well arturo dives not alex
3493603 were all going there to be the best its going to be really exciting
3493604 the olympics are in their backyard which means there will be more pressure on them and we dont know how theyre going to deal with that plus there are a lot of other great divers out there who could have outstanding performances

3493606 it was frankly a mess it was crammed floor to ceiling with art works they were stuffed under the bed over every surface we thought at first he couldnt have lived there and just used it as storage but then we discovered he did live there
3493607 the smaller the items were the more likely they were to have been stolen
3493608 its been difficult some of the galleries are closed some people are deceased or moved on and records arent available

3493621 stargaze war mal eine differenz und ich habe gesagt was passiert wenn aber ich denke mit ihm ist jetzt
3493622 the major thing going on here is how we look at our brands with journalists who know their markets
3493623 we need to do a better job of providing our specific communities with the content that they want and need
3493624 essentially we are shifting from a group of publications into an information company
3493625 its a big change for us but we think it will allow us to deliver more consistent editorial across the brands
3493626 multiple titles are doing the same type of things so we think there are some things we can do once and not multiple times
3493627 the devalued dollar makes u s products real estate and manufacturing plants a bargain
3493628 its the governments role to support people most in need theyre the only ones who can do it that can use tax dollars to do it
3493629 what kind of responsible leadership is this when youre rewarding people who have a lot and doing nothing for people who are really struggling to stay afloat in the best of economic times
3493630 some would have us go down the path to higher spending higher interest payments and higher taxes that approach is misguided our government is taking the path that requires focus prudence and discipline
3493631 portables are not schools it is a sad fact that for many of the children in attawapiskat they will not have had an opportunity to learn and grow in a proper educational facility
3493632 first of all i want to give thanks to danny metatawabin and the peetabeck education authority for organizing and hosting this gathering
3493633 have access to the education programs and services available in public schools in the province in which the reserve is located
3493634 dear prime minister premier minister of education minister of indian affairs mr silva and mr angus
3493635 our government is committed to investing in skills learning and people to create a strong competitive workforce in ontario
3493636 our government is taking the path that requires focus prudence and discipline
3493637 we have been working with the first nations to explore alternative funding options so far none of the options have proven viable
3493638 so poor is the setting for learning its no wonder some children drop out by grade 8
3493639 theres not another school in the country that is made up entirely of portables with no main building
3493640 the learning aspirations and potentials of aboriginal students can be better realized through a responsive transparent and accountable policy
3493641 the temporary accommodations are acceptable as buildings but totally unacceptable in terms of providing a broad inquiry based student centered integrated and seamless program these teaching learning compromises are a great disservice to the students and teachers and totally unacceptable in todays educational environment
3493642 attawapiskat is now due for an evaluation in 2009 10
3493643 the team is of the opinion that the current portable elementary school facility contributes greatly to the age grade delay of the students if something is not done quickly all graduating grade 8 students will have spent their entire elementary school career in portables this is unconscionable and would not be tolerated by parents in a non native community
3493644 i dont want others to go to school in portables that leak windows dont open washroom doors dont close and ceilings are cracked this is not an atmosphere for learning
3493645 right now our concerns are for the health and safety of the students the last health and safety inspection showed it is safe
3493646 i am truly thankful for all the schools and students across canada that have shown their support to our cause we will not give up our children deserve it
3493647 we are very excited as this is the first function organised by the school education department that the chief minister will attend in these two years
3493648 from the design of the building to the shelves furniture and acoustics we are taking great care to ensure all facilities are of very high quality
3493649 barotex enables our design team to create some of the strongest and most durable automotive components ever produced
3493650 for the natalia sls 2 barotex will be formed into various body panels and our revolutionary d tek chassis where its high strength will add significantly to the automobiles torsional rigidity yet our chassis will be more than a thousand pounds lighter than the conventional steel chassis found on other luxury automobiles of similar size
3493651 in contrast carbon fiber products are petroleum based and we know about the challenges that involves
3493652 not only is lava rock more abundant but our manufacturing process requires far less energy it is friendly to the environment and the automobiles built with barotex are lighter so they use less energy every mile traveled
3493653 we recently received our patent for the proprietary process used to produce barotex
3493654 we are delighted that the first production automobile to integrate this technology will be dimoras natalia sls 2 which abounds with technological breakthroughs from bumper to bumper
3493655 when we began designing our 16 cylinder engine that would erupt with 1200 horsepower we decided to call it the volcano v16 its only natural that we now surround the dimora volcano with volcanic rock from barotex

3493657 the bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building oklahoma city was not caused solely by the truck bomb the major factor in its destruction appears to have been detonation of explosives carefully placed at four critical junctures on supporting columns within the building
3493658 esta presi n y el descubrimiento que las inversiones en el campo social son rentables condujeron a una nueva etapa en la cual lo social y lo econ mico se integran en la b squeda de la sustentabilidad
3493659 estamos recuperando todo lo que no hemos podido despachar en 100 d as lo que pas es que hubo rutas cortadas no recib amos insumos nos estamos poniendo al d a para entregar en el exterior porque si no se cumplen los contratos las multas son muy fuertes
3493660 nosotros hemos planteado la idea de abrir una calle descomprimir un poco y no molestar a los vecinos porque somos conscientes que la bodega ya ha quedado en medio de la ciudad
3493661 hay camiones en el interior de la bodega que imposibilitan las tareas pero tampoco podemos sacar 30 unidades a la calle y estacion rselos a los vecinos
3493662 la esquina est cerrada y como la bodega fue comprando los terrenos y las casas hoy estamos en condiciones de realizar esa apertura ahora los t cnicos del municipio trabajar n para determinar el sentido del tr nsito
3493663 la ayuda del gobernador luis beder herrera obedeci a una gran cantidad de cheques devueltos por el corte en la cadena de pago y l dispuso que se entregaran 3 millones para el pago un mill n de pesos sale contra jugo para distribuir en los comedores escolares y dos millones de un pr stamo que hay que devolver en diciembre eso nos permiti seguir funcionando en virtud de ese gesto hemos seguir trabajando normalmente
3493664 no sabemos porqu se habla del cierre de la bodega nacar cuando est funcionando normalmente la riojana no dej ni un empleado afuera porque esa fue la consigna
3493665 este a o elabor 11 millones de kilos de uva lo que no se hace en nacar es fraccionar porque esa tarea se concentra en sus plantas pero su actividad es normal
3493666 es aqu el nico lugar del mundo donde se produce y tenemos que usarlo como nuestro caballito de batalla y como variedad emblem tica y para eso hay que ponerse a trabajar para valorizarlo
3493667 este embarque de vinos a brasil nos muestra una cooperativa que est funcionando normalmente con mercado a nivel internacional dentro de la crisis de bodegas fraccionadoras en el departamento
3493668 hemos estado avanzando en dos eventos importantes uno el de evinor que se va a declarar de inter s municipal lo que nos dio pie para trabajar tambi n en la fiesta del torrent s riojano este emblema que hace falta consolidarlo culturalmente recobrar esta fiesta tan importante queremos que sea un evento organizado entre todos
3493669 tenemos que trabajar con el ente de turismo todo un tema de difusi n de degustaci n y preparar a nuestros comedores y adem s de hacer un buen marketing de este producto que nos identifica a nivel nacional e internacional
3493670 these are not naughty postcards from the beach they are undoubtedly porn pure and simple some of it is quite dark with animals committing fellatio and girl on girl action its quite unpleasant
3493671 the kafka industry doesnt want to know such things about its idol
3493672 and i just looked at him weird but i knew he was drunk so you gotta excuse the dude for saying such weird things
3493673 i was actually jumping up and down round and round until i got overzealous with my jumps that i ended up falling on my butt
3493674 and i was staring at the cd in his hand and finally looked up and said
3493675 he then chuckled and handed me one and handed another to naida
3493676 and then points to a girl who took his sharpie from him i just chuckled and smiled at him after shaun got his sharpie back he signed it and i said my thank yous and goodbyes to him and then naida and i were off
3493677 many neuroscientists are shocked to learn that cells in the brain have cilia thus it was even more exciting to show that cilia have a key function in regulating the birth of new neurons in the brain
3493678 considering sonic hedgehog is also heavily implicated in brain tumor formation our study places the primary cilium at the crossroads of both regenerative neurobiology and neuro oncology
3493679 what result will i get is it worth the x im about to spend
3493680 building on existing protections is a noble aspiration which will be difficult to fulfil as long as so many other politicians denigrate our existing bill of rights the human rights act in thought word and deed
3493681 give due consideration to any future proposals for establishing post office services
3493682 naturally i am very disappointed by this announcement the fact is that the city centre post office is the only real alternative and at peak times that is already very busy
3493683 i am surprised that post office ltd are expecting southgate customers to travel up to bear flat they quite simply wont the people of bath are a victim of the labour governments continuing policy to decimate the post office network
3493684 however i am encouraged that the decision document does not rule out the possibility of putting a new branch into the southgate development although this somewhat contradicts an earlier letter i received
3493685 i will be seeking to work with post office ltd with the aim of putting a profitable office into the southgate development when these 60 new shops and 90 residential properties open they will need to be served by a post office the city centre branch simply will not be able to cope
3493686 when charles street post office was shut residents were asked to use southgate as an alternative where does the post office expect kingsmead residents to go now will they be expected to join the long queues at the city centre branch i wonder if many of them will simply stop using post office services which will only make matters worse
3493687 as far as i am concerned post office ltd have gone back on their word to kingsmead residents they have totally decimated the service they will receive
3493688 some of the post office ltds response makes no sense
3493689 they claim there is a regular bus between southgate and the city centre branch has anyone ever caught a bus between the two it must be the most indirect route and take far longer than walking it is not a practical option
3493690 it is my strongly held opinion that this would be a serious mistake
3493691 the apostle paul and the introspective conscience of the west
3493692 cults and cosmic consciousness religious vision in the american 1960s
3493693 i believe that urgent action is needed to kick start the housing market in wokingham the labour government is dithering and their spin and speculation over stamp duty is further undermining the market by making buyers wait and see
3493694 before home information packs were introduced labour ministers ignored warnings from experts and industry that this new red tape would harm the housing market and the economy
3493695 the proposed site of the mountain biking event in hadleigh is very special and sensitive and we must ensure the legacy this leaves is of a positive nature for local people rather than a negative one
3493696 the shortlist of potential sites for a new welsh prison does not include any site in the conwy constituency
3493697 this will please many constituents particularly in llanfairfechan where bryn y neuadd was a possible site
3493698 llanfairfechan town council worked hard to establish the views of local residents and the consensus was strongly against having the prison in llanfairfechan
3493699 we dont want kids to be scared of water but we do want them to be aware of the dangers and what to do in an emergency
3493700 of all time though i think i d have to go with pamela anderson at one point i thought that there really wasn t anyone that was sexier than her
3493701 r57 also remember that there are a limeted number of guns in the factory im all for all colors on all models its not like you need a special color to know its a rag top
3493702 chellie pingree has been a friend of working families including msea seiu members for many years
3493703 chellie will provide leadership at the national level to help working families struggling with high gas prices skyrocketing heating costs and ris ing health insurance premiums by electing chellie to congress working families will have a strong voice in washington shell look out for all of us
3493704 the american electorate is weary of the political games played in washington and mainers and americans deserve a representative and a congress that is committed to rising above the partisan politics and rhetoric to work to make a difference from day one
3493705 we are going to be doing more budget cutting more budget restructuring more efficiencies we have only just begun that process with jails and school administrative districts more needs to be done and we are going to do more of that and reduce the income tax on earned income
3493706 have you ever wondered what goes on inside the mind of a black man well if you dont know then you better ask somebody about
3493707 i am not what i ought to be i am not what i want to be i am not what i hope to be but still i am not what i used to be and by the grace of god i am what i am
3493708 its better to be hated for who you are then to be loved for who you are not
3493709 i dont know what the key to success is but the key to failure is trying to please everybody
3493710 a womans heart should be so close to god that a man has to seek god to find it
3493711 i gather up each sound you left behind and stretch them on our bed each night i breathe you and become high
3493712 dream as if youll live forever live as if youll die tomorrow
3493713 when you educate a man you educate an individual but when you educate a woman you educate a nation
3493714 any writer i suppose feels that the world into which he was born is nothing less than a conspiracy against the cultivation of his talent
3493715 few people think more than two or three times a year i have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week
3493716 if you dont mind me asking a rather personal question i would like to know if you eat pussy
3493717 why i dont mind saying that yes i do and i love it what was it that gave you the first clue do i have some pubic hair in my teeth
3493718 id like a portrait of robert redford on the inside of my right thigh and a portrait of paul newman on the inside of my left thigh and i want them both looking at my pussy
3493719 strip from the waist down and get up on the table

3493731 how much do you think they really paid for their spots
3493732 a most common question now posed to marketing people who present their ad budgets and plans to top management and board of directors for approval is how much incremental sales can we expect from spending that money on ads and how can we recover that big investment on ads the answers have to be given without sounding too academic about it in order to assure approval for the budget so the marketing manager turns around to face their ad agencies and media buyers and asks them the same questions posed by their bosses
3493733 so whatever happened to the big to do in the late 90s about the marketing department and the ad agencies being made jointly responsible for bringing in sales and revenues perhaps resti you can devote another article about this dilemma ad agencies should get their commission only if marketing objectives and budgets are met if yes plus a nice bonus for exceeding targets but if not sorry na lang
3493734 you must never forget that that night you caused the death of philip charalambous
3493735 no sentence i can impose for this offence or even causing death by dangerous driving can possibly compensate for a life needlessly lost
3493736 we cannot be a party that strips working americans of the right to a secret ballot election
3493737 gang of 10 from the senate including republican senators lindsey graham john thune saxby chambliss bob corker and johnny isakson announced a
3493738 at one point i thought i wasnt going to play again
3493739 i decided that after the way things went in the playoffs that i wasnt ready to quit
3493740 people say oh youre old you cant play anymore but i truly believe it was kind of a fluke season
3493741 everybody has a year once and a while with injuries im close to being 100 percent and really feel good coming in this year and having a good season
3493742 you dont realize how much you love something until you lose it
3493743 if someone comes to me looking for some advice i have no problem giving it
3493744 as ive gotten older i just kind of do my own thing and try and be the best pro i can be by coming to the ice every night prepared to play
3493745 when you go to a new team you kind of find your way
3493746 you sit back and watch and you more or less do your own thing at some point you just kind of fit in
3493747 i think hes got such a reputation as a feared player that hes definitely one of the guys that you want on your side
3493748 it was just one of those things where we ran into each other and neither one of us was going to back down
3493749 rick was a tough customer when he played and i really respect how he played the game i hear great things about him as a coach so im looking forward to working with him
3493750 i dont see any reason why this team cant be a real contender this season
3493751 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3493752 co opted by party crashers who have a bone to pick with this country
3493753 since her initiation the communist party central committee and the late chinese leaders including mao zedong and zhou enlai has provided great care and teachings for the development of the university
3493754 china is a nation with a long history of forgiving and also tolerance
3493755 well the olympic games are more than a chance for the worlds athletes to excel they also give the host nation an opportunity to shine for china and its 1 3 billion people the beijing games are feeding a groundswell of pride
3493756 from designer clothes to new cars china is getting rich democracies once bragged that theirs was the only way to economic success china is doing it the communist way

3493811 este proceso de separaci n proporciona un arma poderosa para el estudio de la estructura de una manada ya que si dos voces tienen frecuencias instant neas proporcionales podemos suponer que se trata de dos arm nicos diferentes producidos por un mismo lobo y si no las tienen pero coinciden en el tiempo podemos asegurar que las emiten individuos distintos lo que nos permite estimar el n mero m nimo de lobos que han aullado o ladrado en el coro

3493836 it was not only the army that rose in its defense but also regular citizens

3493840 give me your hands tonight and ill take you somewhere a little higher
3493841 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3493842 this happened because we started to eat better food like eating more meat
3493843 did not make humans as smart as they are today
3493844 the same very boring stone tools for almost 2 million years
3493845 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3493846 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3493847 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3493848 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3493849 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation
3493850 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3493851 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3493852 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3493853 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3493854 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3493855 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3493856 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3493857 one of the highest priority tasks to avoid contamination of the human food chain with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
3493858 enables the real time detection of possible central nervous system cns tissue contamination on carcasses during slaughter
3493859 small quantities of bovine spinal cord were reliably detected in the presence of raw bovine skeletal muscle fat and vertebrae the research lays the foundation for development of a prototype device allowing real time monitoring of cns tissue contamination on bovine carcasses and meat cuts
3493860 our study found that combat deployment in support of the wars in iraq and afghanistan was significantly associated with new onset heavy weekly drinking binge drinking and other alcohol related problems among reserve guard and younger personnel after return from deployment
3493861 because alcohol use may serve as a coping mechanism after traumatic events it is plausible that deployment is associated with increased rates of alcohol consumption or problem drinking
3493862 i think this study is probably very accurate as part of the re entry process people will turn to coping mechanisms that are easily accessible and alcohol is easily available socially acceptable and quite effective for short term stress relief
3493863 surround yourself with people you can talk to and establish a support system that isnt tied to a bar
3493864 have a huge effect and it could lead people to treatment on their own
3493865 would be a real and clear indication that they valued and respected the contribution of these people
3493866 in settings with a large proportion of psa detected tumors the relative reduction in risk of death following radical prostatectomy removal of the gland might be somewhat larger or similar to that in our study but the absolute reduction would be smaller
3493867 unclear how these results apply to the patients we are taking care of today they show how many questions remain unanswered
3493868 basically i dont think we know the right answer about what to do
3493869 more men die with their prostate cancer than of it
3493870 i have discussions with a patient about his other medical conditions his age his willingness to receive treatment that may have long term side effects weighed against the risk that he may develop an aggressive cancer
3493871 does provide evidence that intervention in the form of surgery does have a curative effect for some men the question is which men
3493872 with screening you catch a lot of different types of cancer and also at different ages there is no information in the study on the age of detection
3493873 the big benefit of treating potentially lethal prostate cancer comes early in the first five to 10 years

3493883 all those crazy people are very particular because when they smell blood it is impossible to stop them
3493884 therefore you need to make a surgery to stop this problem
3493885 allies reiterated in very strong terms the full respect necessary for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3493886 and that is more than a phrase in a period of time when that territorial integrity is not respected by russia
3493887 i want to make very clear that the u s stands with the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3493888 we are reviewing our options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing now is that these military operations need to stop
3493889 we have tried to find solutions on paper that would allow us short term means to achieve an agreement so that there will be a definite cessation of hostilities
3493890 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3493891 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3493892 obama did no such thing the budget resolution that the mccain campaign is referring to didnt raise taxes on anyone
3493893 its a good way to draw contrasts between the priorities of both parties
3493894 this cycle we have highlighted those republicans who voted against our budget in particular on the schip reserve
3493895 youve got two different sets of standards here the standard you would use in journalism or scholarship and the standard you would use in a political campaign political campaigns take a little more license
3493896 its been a good experience for me socially as well as economically
3493897 people are well aware of global warming but it takes the price of gasoline to get them to take that step
3493898 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3493899 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3493900 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3493901 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3493902 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened
3493903 i come from a lot of blues and rock ryan dyck guitarist bassist harmonica player comes from a lot of folk and kyle harmon drummer comes from a lot of jazz but when we all got together it works and were always introducing each other to a lot of freaky new stuff
3493904 we dont like to be pinned down we like to be treeline in different forms but under the same umbrella sometimes we open for ourselves as the duo then the three of us
3493905 i dont play a lot of evening shows im a mom with three children so you can imagine how hard it is to fit this in last year was my 40th birthday so i decided to celebrate by recording and album and sharing my music
3493906 plus it was the 10th anniversary of my sisters battle with cancer i donated bone marrow to her i didnt even feel it i would have given her an arm and a leg
3493907 ive been writing songs since i was 15 three chord things i wrote about what i thought the world should be like then i gave it up for a while but got back into it because i realized it was more interesting writing about the things i see i realized how much more you have to say at 40 that affects other people
3493908 i have two lives im a businessperson music isnt my livelihood music is for me but ive heard so many stories from people who were affected or touched by my music thats the greatest feeling in the world
3493909 the level of focus within the side is very high and everyone will want to do well tomorrow
3493910 we still have a very good team out tomorrow and hopefully we can get the result we want
3493911 we always have a very young midfield and a very young team at the moment but that does not mean we do not have experience
3493912 if you are a good football player you are a good football player whether its in the champions league or in another game
3493913 when you have the ball you make an intelligent decision
3493914 if you play against your friends on the beach or in a big game its exactly the same if you are a good player you are a good player
3493915 in england we have always to calm things down because after one month of games there is always the media pressure to make quick stars
3493916 players are young and patient development does not mean you cannot start early but it is most important to keep developing as a player and that you dont have to worry about too much pressure on your shoulders
3493917 every game makes its own history and we just want to be up for it
3493918 they are a team who have knocked out ajax in the qualifiers of the champions league that deserves respect
3493919 we know they have a typical dutch culture of playing football and keeping the ball very well and therefore we need a good defensive concentration
3493920 i think it was a good move he maybe needed to get a change from england
3493921 to position yourself as an international coach is always a very good move for the rest of your career
3493922 it is a little bit similar to what sir bobby robson did when he moved out of the england job
3493923 i believe most of these players will be out for a very short time
3493924 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3493925 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3493926 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3493927 the georgians have agreed to a ceasefire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3493928 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3493929 i hope well never come to the question of what we do if russia refuses to observe international law
3493930 imperative that russia respect the sovereignty and david emerson called for

3493935 we are talking to local and international banks to structure the right deal
3493936 we dont know if its going to be islamic or conventional

3493951 a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing
3493952 actually had a conversation with his son before it happened
3493953 israel made some kind of statement that he was having some issues with his girlfriend something about going back to a funeral some place in washington
3493954 he told him he had just shot and killed his girlfriend and her son and was going to shoot himself and he did
3493955 this is the first one where weve had two people murdered
3493956 they were pretty new in school not a lot of people knew them
3493957 the people that did know them say they seemed to be pretty complacent wed never had a response up there we never had any complaints of anything domestic prior to this quite a surprise i guess
3493958 the big thing is the citations were issued and the horses were saved
3493959 they basically didnt understand why we were seeing what we were seeing they figured the horses were tired and needed some care i think a lot of it came to not knowing horses
3493960 his head picked up and he was looking to us for help
3493961 he nursed the water bottle like a foal at a mothers teet we would take turns running to the creek because there was no easy access to water
3493962 he was more concerned about us finding the horse and who we told than about the condition of the horse
3493963 he whinnied as soon as i walked up on him
3493964 i dont believe the horse was terminal but certainly had been used hard and not cared for in an appropriate fashion
3493965 its our opinion that the women saved one horses life
3493966 the local vet thinks they all are going to make it but they are dealing with a lot of pain they are walking in baby steps and there are wounds across their backs

3493973 reiterates in the strongest possible terms that such behavior if substantiated is wholly unacceptable
3493974 should be taken as soon as possible against those found to be involved in such misconduct
3493975 that the allegations will be promptly and thoroughly investigated and if proven strict and exemplary action would be taken as per the law
3493976 the misconduct of a few should not diminish the enormous contribution and sacrifice of the large number of blue helmets who serve the cause of peace

3493985 china and the u s are the class of the world
3493986 we got all of our jitters out of the way which we needed to do
3493987 it gives us something that will motivate us and push to be even stronger for the next competition
3493988 especially for the young team members theres no 100 percent guarantee so it is indeed a risk
3493989 our target is the gold but no one says they can have assurance
3493990 some 90 of marketers agencies and other suppliers of direct marketing services say they use non catalog direct mail and nearly half 46 say it is their primary channel for promotions according to a news study from the direct mail best practices benchmarks and strategies

3493993 the global economy is facing a triple crunch a combination of a credit fuelled financial crisis accelerating climate change and soaring energy prices underpinned by encroaching peak oil
3493994 it is increasingly clear that these three overlapping events threaten to develop into a perfect storm the like of which has not been seen since the great depression with potentially devastating consequences
3493995 some rural installations could have costs of energy that are competitive with grid electricity but in many urban situations it appears that roof mounted turbines may not pay back the carbon emitted during their production installation and operation
3493996 small scale wind energy is attracting growing interest and at the carbon trust we are receiving increasing enquiries from organisations considering installing small turbines its vital that people understand the wind resources available to them
3493997 it is essential that government policies and public funding encourage carbon savings from small wind turbines most effectively
3493998 with the increasing threat of climate change its important we understand the sustainable energy resources available to us
3493999 city wind turbines are one fourth as effective as country wind turbines

3494001 hes definitely up for it hes become a real jack the lad since he lost his virginity
3494002 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out and an interest in the natural world doesnt grow as it should nobody is going to protect the natural world unless they understand it
3494003 he causes the grass to grow for the cattle and vegetation for the labour of man so that he may bring forth food from the earth
3494004 all that we borrowed up to 1985 or 1986 was about 5bn
3494005 so far we have paid back about 16bn yet were being told that we still owe about 28bn if you ask me what is the worst thing in the world i would say it is compound interest
3494006 there is no such thing as a usurious rate of interest
3494007 interest based finance is not a pre requisite for societys sustainable advancement
3494008 if we wish to live more ecologically it would make sense to adopt monetary systems that make it easier for us to do so
3494009 but im not sure i can afford to be very high minded when im making a decision that could readily turn out badly for me compared with choosing b
3494010 the president of nigeria says interest is bad and he should know he owes billions
3494011 garbled paraphrase of whatever he said that he would probably be embarrassed to have attributed to him
3494012 in summary it would appear that the illusion that money can grow without physical limits results from three things first as long as production of real goods and services increases more money is required to pursue them so growth in money is justified but growth cannot of course continue forever on a finite planet second as the number or price of financial assets grows such as speculative bubbles then the demand for money grows as well and supply can increase to meet this demand the fact is however that financial bubbles inevitably burst third holders of financial capital see their capital grow because speculation can transfer resources from those who produce to those who speculate such transfers of wealth has limits though the limits are obscured by economic growth thus the appearance that money is exempt from the laws of thermodynamics is an illusion that can be maintained while scale is increasing or the financial sector is expanding relative to the real sector it remains impossible for real money to grow without limit
3494013 he describes alternatives to interest bearing loans such as the sharing of profit and loss
3494014 until relatively recently the charging of interest was called usury it was a sin and doing without money that was lent at interest didnt stop our predecessors trading or building incredible monuments
3494015 the conflict going on between collectivists on the one hand and supporters of individual liberty on the other i have never been able to uncover a rational logical thinking process in the collectivist approach just arbitrary nonsense
3494016 there is a systemic deficit in ethical values within the banking industry this will not change by hanging a few people out to dry
3494017 you might ask what has this to do with the environment a great deal because in order to repay debts businesses and whole economies must grow and that usually involves consuming ever greater quantities of non renewable resources
3494018 also contrary to what is sometimes supposed the church strongly favored the charging of interest on loans indeed the canonists first applied the word
3494019 even 8 year olds understand that 1 if you lend your pocket money to your mate he doesnt always pay you back why bother taking the risk if theres nothing in it for you
3494020 because in order to repay debts businesses and whole economies must grow and that usually involves consuming ever greater quantities of non renewable resources
3494021 great civilisations in iraq spain and the ottoman empire were all built without interest bearing loans

3494030 they will wonder how we could have been taken in by people such as gore to the extent of causing food shortages with ridiculous attempts to make
3494031 it is very exciting and highly unusual to discover a reef structure this large and harboring such an abundance of fish
3494032 we had some clues from local fishermen that other reefs existed but not at the scale of what we discovered
3494033 due to their relative inaccessibility and depth the newly discovered reefs are teeming with life in some places harboring 30 times the density of marine life than the known shallower reefs
3494034 having caused a health scandal by feeding dead meat to herbivores the government reacted in 1996 by banning the practice of feeding meat and bone meal to omnivores
3494035 meanwhile pigs and cows alike are now increasingly fed on gm soya from north america or non gm from the amazon
3494036 flying near empty planes across britain simply to preserve airport take off slots would be environmental vandalism
3494037 the government must intervene to prevent this kind of gratuitous climate wrecking from taking place and stand firm on its plans to switch to an aviation tax based on planes not passengers
3494038 it is imperative that the system for running slots does nothing to push the airlines into flying empty planes besides damaging the environment it makes absolutely no economic sense
3494039 every system is perfectly designed to get the results it does
3494040 god gave us dominion over the earth to do as we liked with it
3494041 it is imperative that the system for running slots does nothing to push the airlines into flying empty planes besides damaging the environment it makes absolutely no economic sense
3494042 most species in the 1986 2005 period had higher optimum elevations than those in the 1905 1985 period
3494043 we provide strong evidence that forest plant species have already followed the pace of climate change by shifting their distributions to higher altitudes
3494044 we have since made more discoveries of the neglected sedge since and we estimate there could be around 4000 plants although that sounds like a lot you could still fit the entire world population in a sports bag
3494045 st helenas wildlife has been ravaged by species introduced to the island goats gorse grasses and cage birds have all been liberated on the island where they have wreaked havoc with the native species
3494046 st helena is a noted extinction hotspot driven largely by non native species and the native birds have suffered more here than many other islands
3494047 convincing warnings about declining fish and other marine species must rest on a valid census
3494048 this project will improve information vital to researchers investigating fisheries invasive species threatened species and marine ecosystem functioning as well as to educators it will eliminate the misinterpretation of names confusion over latin spellings redundancies and a host of other problems that sow confusion and slow scientific progress
3494049 that species can have very different forms it can be green it can be yellow it can differ in shape scientists who thought they had discovered a new species had just found different forms
3494050 im not surprised at the duplication people have been working for centuries in differebnt oceans and different languages
3494051 its crucial we use the new technology to connect people around the world thats whats happening here what we are doing here is entering a new age of information technology
3494052 the recent emission decreases among the eu 15 are encouraging
3494053 nevertheless prompt and full implementation of the policies and measures adopted or planned remains crucial member states need to keep accelerating their efforts to limit or reduce emissions
3494054 by 2015 i think we would be lucky to be producing 60 million barrels and we should worry about producing only 40 million
3494055 a lot of these oilfields are 40 years old once they roll over they roll over very fast
3494056 this is already happening in the us our local farms ranches and dairies are booming they are having a huge comeback
3494057 if we dont change we are just going to start fighting one another so lets just start assuming the worst and plan for it
3494058 the good news is the world is not running out of oil
3494059 as usual men and wargames in pursuit of earth domination causing havoc and death to countless beings
3494060 you might just as well point the finger at fishing boats or car ferries

3494063 the biological significance for the population is not significant at all
3494064 outer hebrides rather than cornwall rather than cornwall it wouldnt have got the same publicity
3494065 penguins are sentinels of the marine environment and by observing and studying them researchers can learn about the rate and nature of changes occurring in the southern oceans as ocean samplers penguins provide insights into patterns of regional ocean productivity and long term climate variation
3494066 the airline is mindful of its carbon footprint in the same way that the ba mainline operation is
3494067 while the economic climate has worsened in recent months we believe that openskies can compete effectively it has a low cost base and support from ba in key areas such as sales and marketing this differentiates it from some new airlines that have failed recently which were operating in isolation without the backing of an established carrier
3494068 low seating density means passengers flying bas open skies will have double the carbon footprint of passengers using conventional services if ba wants its green claims to be taken seriously it should concentrate on cutting its contribution to climate change rather than increasing it
3494069 in times of scarce oil supplies youd think that bas corporate social responsibility team would suggest promoting teleconferencing and maximising passenger loads not flying 82 rich businessmen in beds across the atlantic for a jolly if this is the face of responsible aviation then the hands are sticking two fingers up to the rest of us
3494070 service from london city to jfk with just 32 passengers aboard an a318
3494071 ba had not so far been successful in encouraging many passengers to take it up

3494088 we live in an age where young people are flattered into believing that they can do anything that they want its not true you have to have an aptitude for something a talent for it but ability alone is not

3494090 the differences in species responses to local forest cover are to a large extent driven by the dispersal vector used by trees
3494091 whatever the mechanisms involved the finding that animal dispersed tree species are more robust to the effects of deforestation has an obvious implication for conservation

3494107 in the twin cities since june 17 weve received 2 4 inches of rain and thats about five inches short of normal a lot of places in central minnesota are around two to three to four inches short of normal
3494108 its not as widespread as the droughts that we had the last couple of years this is the third summer in a row where weve seen some drought in minnesota so its not quite as bad as previous years
3494109 the big difference is the heat we didnt have the heat this summer that we had in previous summers

3494149 his sense of commitment and dedication are matched only by his ability to produce outstanding and extremely well attended programs

3494156 what were seeing in all the classes is that this is going to be a high scoring regatta theres a lot of changing of places
3494157 the winds were pretty light course a where andrew and jo aleh sailed was quite tricky but typical of qingdao conditions it was pretty much as we expected
3494158 andrew had a great day but hes prepared very well so were not surprised by where he is theres still a long long way to go but so far hes been racing very well
3494159 hes been pretty conservative with his starts and struggled for a while but he worked his way through the fleet for seventh and in the second race he got everything right
3494160 toms exactly where we hoped hed be hes sailing to his potential
3494161 barbara got everything right in the second race and sailed really well in the conditions shes a very determined sailor and technically very good theyve got a day off tomorrow and barbara will rest and regroup and come back stronger

3494164 science has moved so quickly in gene therapy and because it moves so quickly it makes the non therapeutic use of these kinds of methods much more likely and much more imminent
3494165 and the sooner it pops up in sport the more likely it is to pop up in other areas
3494166 the feeling is that in that amount of time the science can make significant inroads in the competitive world of sports everyone is looking for an edge and theres every reason to believe that coaches and their athletes maybe even their agents will be looking at this
3494167 i think its extremely important for wada as a world organization to have feedback from a scientific organization like aaas bringing its voice and its reflections on some of the issues we are facing beyond the technical aspects

3494193 the strong recovery in the dollar adds more pressure to the sector which is already suffering from fears over slowing global growth
3494194 while not ready to call an end to this years bull market especially considering the murky outlook for chinese energy demand and continuing weather and geopolitical risks the agencys assessment of increased supply and inventories from june to july provides some fundamental justification for the sharp fall in benchmark crude prices in july

3494197 forty million of our nations children are returning this fall to a system that is broken
3494198 they are entering into a culture that has been stripped of all notion of right and wrong they are sitting down in classrooms designed to educate in math science and english and instead are being taught about alternative lifestyles and lessons that promote sex to our youngsters so how can any of us be shocked when they engage in outrageous sexual behavior the schools all but endorse it

3494214 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3494215 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3494216 o my son the one who is carrying your secrets is not me but my spiritual teacher who migrated from daghistan to turkey and who is now residing in damascus in the midan district saahat il midan he is known as the master of the golden chain of the naqshbandi order in our time
3494217 it may be that my lord guides me unto a nearer way of truth than this
3494218 a sufi is a person who treads on this path and its teachings
3494219 one who has indulged in gaining knowledge without tasawwuf is a heretic the one who has indulged in tasawwuf without gaining knowledge is a major sinner and the one who has indulged in both together has achieved ones goal
3494220 it has been narrated in the hadith by hazrat abdul rahman bin auf may allah almighty be pleased with him that one day when prophet muhammad peace be upon him left his house i followed close behind
3494221 the science of weighing positive and negative factors for evaluating the reliability of hadith narrators
3494222 anything which has a support mustanad from the sharia is not bida even if the early muslims did not do it
3494223 anger spoils faith iman as the bitterness of aloes sap spoils honey
3494224 a day when wealth will not avail nor sons but only him who brings allah a sound heart
3494225 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3494226 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3494227 anger is a poison that contaminates the blood it diminishes the stored up spiritual energy within you youll never be able to become spiritual unless you overcome anger and resentment
3494228 i want you to recognize that this jar represents your life the golf balls are the important things your god family your children your health your friends and your favorite passions things that if everything else was lost and only they remained your life would still be full
3494229 there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls the same goes for life if you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness play with your children take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand
3494230 im glad you asked it just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem theres always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend
3494231 people with wisdom know that it is important to correct their own mistakes while people without wisdom find it necessary to point out the mistakes of others people with strong faith know that it is important to clear their own hearts while those with unsteady faith seek to find fault in the hearts and prayers of others this becomes a habit in their lives but those who pray to allah with faith determination and certitude know that the most important thing in life is to surrender their hearts to allah
3494232 im taking you for a ride you just sit back and relax and enjoy the view
3494233 tata da mi sapte milioane ca am lasat o pe una gravida
3494234 i aint falling for any good cop good cop shit
3494235 by keeping company of good people you will develop goodness in your character and by avoiding the society of wicked person you will abstain from wickedness
3494236 do not talk about knowledge with the foolish so that they deny you nor with the ignorant so that they find you oppressive but talk about it with those of its people whom you meet who will accept it and understand it
3494237 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3494238 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3494239 thats a lot to ask when the service member has much more important things on their minds such as staying alive and keeping those around them alive
3494240 this should not be a very difficult decision to make
3494241 while ata cannot by law even suggest uniform pricing policies to our members we will bring this matter to their attention for their independent consideration
3494242 air transport association member airlines have always been committed to supporting our nations military
3494243 airlines routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
3494244 we can help them with additional expenses for travel but soldiers have to submit a receipt and it has to be looked at by our finance people
3494245 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3494246 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3494247 there has never been such a spotlight on the industry
3494248 its a little late credit card shenanigans have already cost me my future
3494249 the credit card industry doesnt really want you to pay off your debt
3494250 its like a sweat box they want you in there as long as possible
3494251 too many card issuers engage in very very severe abuses and outrageous practices its indefensible
3494252 when i look at the money that we have paid to discover during just the last two years i feel sick of the 5 618 made in payments to discover 3478 39 went to interest
3494253 my husband and i feel as though weve been robbed
3494254 they take it very seriously i think they are very nervous
3494255 delinquency and default are nearly always due to loss of job or a life event such as health problems and medical bills death or divorce
3494256 i dont know why they did it but im not very happy about it
3494257 theyre going to be much more aggressive everyone is going to see some price increase unless they have perfect credit
3494258 they cant squeeze too hard that theyre going to kill their client but they have to squeeze more revenue out of their current portfolios
3494259 i would expect banks to raise fees on a variety of services to offset some of the losses
3494260 theyre going to start to nickel and dime you to build non interest revenue
3494261 amid congress preoccupation with fears about the economy the ramp up in fees and punishing practices by consumer lenders will go unchecked
3494262 abundantly clear that we do need new laws and rules to protect consumers to protect the market
3494263 financial institutions have a right to make a profit but they dont have a right to make an extra profit because they messed up elsewhere
3494264 a lot of issuers are still re pricing accounts based on credit scores
3494265 were not sure the fed cuts will have an immediate effect
3494266 pull back on offering cards or increase pricing or neither
3494267 assess fewer fees on customers as they continue to adjust to last years new pricing
3494268 i cant tell a lie pa you know i cant tell a lie i did cut it with my hatchet
3494269 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3494270 man they give me one of them hound dog shots yesterday and those things make you crazy
3494271 a hound dog shot they gave you a hound dog shot
3494272 well i dont know if it was the sheriff that give it to me but yeah i got one of them shots yesterday
3494273 they gave you a hound dog shot yesterday because youre crazy and thats why you wouldnt go to court
3494274 is there any chance the shot they gave you was a haldol shot an anti psychotic drug
3494275 just like i told you they give me one of those hound dog shots and it made me crazy
3494276 whatever you say man ill say whatever you want me to
3494277 well its not really supposed to be about what i tell you to say
3494278 well its not that either how about saying what really happened
3494279 you want me to tell the judge what really happened
3494280 why cant i just say he attacked me that it was self defense man thats what it was
3494281 hell no ive been looking for that little fucker for bout a month
3494282 we always practiced for an emergency situation so we would know exactly what we were suppose to do
3494283 i could never figure out why so many people dont have a financial emergency plan
3494284 both the charge off and the delinquency rates are clearly on the rise and in the coming months will likely continue to rise
3494285 those who depend upon allah allah bestows his bounty upon them and provides for them from means unknown
3494286 o son of adam so long as you call upon me and ask of me i shall forgive you for what you have done and i shall not mind
3494287 our strategy is that it wasnt your gun and it wasnt your money
3494288 what we need is a new strategy what else you got
3494289 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3494290 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3494291 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3494292 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3494293 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3494294 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3494295 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3494296 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3494297 i am proud to have been chosen to sing at all
3494298 gt as soon as olympics begin an american is stabbed to death relative of volleyball coach be respectful of others and their opinions
3494299 preventative responses to suicide need to be embedded into a wide range of areas of societal policy that include education criminal justice and health
3494300 the budget of 3 05m allocated by government is totally inadequate and must be increased immediately to 10m
3494301 all deaths are tragic but it is a fact that more people die by suicide than on our roads
3494302 there is an urgent need for research to identify the reasons why so many of our young people with their life opportunities ahead of them take their own lives
3494303 it is important that the reasons why this is happening are identified and understood so that society may respond appropriately
3494304 democratic party leaders in the house are expected to convene a conference call on wednesday to discuss their options in the ongoing energy debate including a potential compromise measure that could include some expanded permitting for oil and gas exploration a leadership aide said tuesday
3494305 but the details remain very hazy democratic insiders suggest because leaders have not settled on an exact course of action and may wait until lawmakers return to washington next month before finalizing a legislative package
3494306 the rhetoric of the lawmakers who have remained in washington to protest pelosis d calif decision to not allow a vote on oil exploration in the outer continental shelf ocs signals that the gop does not plan on letting go of its message that the speaker should immediately return to washington to reconvene the house
3494307 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act minority leader john boehner r ohio said in a statement released tuesday morning
3494308 i was certainly encouraged to hear the speaker last night suggest a willingness to allow the house to have an up or down vote on the merits of unlocking the potential of americas abundant energy resources but the proof will be in the proverbial pudding republican whip roy blunt mo stated
3494309 both boehner and blunt said their partys protest would go on

3494312 naar het schijnt is de locatie voor een nieuw stadion in antwerpen beslist maar ze wordt nog niet gecommuniceerd antwerpen is het symbool voor wat er in belgi misloopt qua sportinfrastructuur een stad met die uitstraling die geen topsportstadion die naam waardig heeft het nieuwe stadion zou zowel voor antwerp als voor germinal beerschot moeten dienen en zou ongeveer 40 000 plaatsen tellen

3494317 vlaams parlementslid patrick de klerck open vld verspreidde na een debat met de minister in de commissie sport van het vlaams parlement verkeerde informatie
3494318 ik was persoonlijk aanwezig tijdens het debat en kan na ruggespraak met de minister formeel bevestigen dat collega de klerck de informatie onvolledig en tendentieus weergeeft zijn bericht geeft de indruk dat het stadion van club brugge niet in aanmerking zou kunnen komen
3494319 dat bedrag staat niet in de meerjarenbegroting omdat het over kapitaal gaat van de participatiemaatschappij vlaanderen dat is een aparte begroting het zal als risicodragend kapitaal ge nvesteerd worden in voetbalstadions op voorwaarde dat er een sluitend businessplan kan voorgelegd worden daar zijn afspraken over gemaakt binnen de vlaamse regering een en ander is ook afhankelijk gesteld van een splitsing van de belgische voetbalbond kbvb de vlaamse overheid zal in deze gevallen een minderheidsparticipatie van maximaal 25 procent per stadion opnemen

3494346 our lives should be lived with expectancy not necessarily with expectation because expectation tends to dictate terms the pharisees lived with expectation and rejected christ when he did not the rigid narrowness of their expectations often i wonder if we waiting for christs return do it more with expectation than expectancy expectancy is the belief that god will do something expectation insists he do it in just this way sometimes expectation blinds us more to the god who is here right now than outright disbelief does the pharisees couldnt see jesus for looking or those two disciples on the road to emmaus there they are bemoaning the absence of the very one whos present with them what made them deaf and blind expectations we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem israel luke 24 21 but that hope took a form that shut out surprises like crosses and resurrection and a deeper redemption

3494376 in zimbabwe perhaps 5 percent of the land went to those with political ties another 15 percent went to civil servants or others with jobs in the urban economy peasant farmers got about 80 percent of the land and they are doing much better than the rest this could be because they farm in more labour intensive ways and are less dependent on purchased inputs and fuel which have been in short supply because of wider economic problems
3494377 sure there have been failures particularly in the areas where highly capitalised farming had been taken over or where long nurtured market relationships have been undermined such as in the tobacco or horticulture sector getting these back on track will take time and resources but in other areas where small scale farmers have taken on land against all the odds including lack of credit poor infrastructure and recurrent drought many farmers with newly acquired land have been doing surprisingly well they have been investing in new homes growing herds of cattle and reaping substantial yields of crops in good rainfall years
3494378 this has undermined the establishment of new farming businesses particularly on the small scale commercial resettlements
3494379 those with lower input requirements and hooked into more localised exchange networks in the small scale farming resettlements have fared better but even so recent times have been very tough for everyone
3494380 there are many positive dimensions to the zimbabwean land reform and important lessons for the region including the real potential of small scale agriculture if it is given support there is also potential for a dynamic entrepreneurial local economy with new players emerging in the market
3494381 there are multiple examples of success in zimbabwe alongside the better documented examples of failure but success must be nurtured and supported and this will only come with sustained political and economic stability
3494382 it seems as if the households who have a legal claim on the land accept the non claimant families
3494383 this proves that there is a strong demand for land for homestead purposes these people are subsistence farmers who seem to be quite content the irony is that this is not the kind of outcome envisioned by government who is more focused on establishing commercial farmers even though munzhedzi is clearly working and there is a huge need for small plots subsistence farming is not an acceptable concept to government and as yet there is no help for people who want only a small piece of land
3494384 just after independence in 1990 a national land reform conference was held which lay the foundation for a peaceful land reform process
3494385 however the land reform process is taking place much too slowly for most people

3494558 puede usted sugerirme un buen vino de menos de 15 d lares 10 euros
3494559 la mayor a del vino que hay en el mundo es barato s lo ha sido en los ltimos 10 a os m s o menos cuando han despegado los vinos por encima de los 50 d lares en realidad es un xito de m arketing no de buen gusto
3494560 siempre ha habido vinos buenos y mejores pero los fabricantes de productos de lujo y las marcas que venden a gran escala se han vuelto francamente astutas en el m rketing de sus productos
3494561 han creado este nicho de mercado a partir de la nada

3494564 pero quer a asegurarme de que los vinos incluidos en el libro fueran de f cil acceso para cualquiera
3494565 creo que en este sistema econ mico es importante que la gente averig e qu le gusta realmente y ahora tienen m s de un incentivo financiero para catar vinos y descubrir qu se esconde detr s de la marca en lugar de ser seducida por sta

3494569 as a country weve really grown up over the last few years we realised what was happening and tapped into it
3494570 the steinlager brand has been built up over 50 years
3494571 so we had this big group of people who loved the brand and the liquid but also another group who loved the brand but found the taste too strong we discovered there was this backlog of people just waiting to join up
3494572 there are a lot of factors working for and against us
3494573 hey do you like all these people like me too like me too
3494574 it was a long nagging trip and i didnt receive my luggage so im hoping to get it tonight
3494575 im fine though i feel no aches or pains i slept a bit on the plane and i dont feel bad because im used to traveling and having delays not like this though but ive got to stay calm be patient and hope for the best
3494576 i got the work done and im confident going into my races
3494577 in 2004 i had just gotten out of college with no experience and went into the olympics blind not knowing who my competitors were
3494578 but this time ive competed with all of the best competitors in track so i wouldnt be as nervous and ill be more confident in myself my races and my coaching i know what i have to do
3494579 i have to execute properly and thats what ive been training to do over the last couple months

3494586 we are mindful of the rising costs of fuel and the impact it is having on wapas cash flow and by extension on each of us in terms of our monthly electricity bills
3494587 i am also mindful of the need to balance wapas financial survival with the financial constraints we face as a community in terms of supporting our many critical needs
3494588 i think there is still a strong stigma against hiv
3494589 and there is still an unwillingness to accept the seriousness of our hiv problem here in the virgin islands
3494590 i thought it was one of the first times that we probably really and truly addressed some of the concerns of the clients
3494591 i think since that point we really havent had major major problems with the adap program for our clients
3494592 this is not just a vicare issue its not just a hope issue its not just a department of health issue
3494593 its really a collective issue that impacts the entire community
3494594 if youre not using a condom in an area with one of the highest concentrations of hiv in the country the risk is high
3494595 we potentially will see a lot higher numbers in the future

3494599 but i still was an inch ahead it was very hard for him to score against me because i wasnt there for him it was bam bam bam and id move i just stuck with my strategy for the whole fight and came out with a good win
3494600 im just glad he was able to take it out because his opponent was very mature and hes a longtime fighter while john is only 19 years old
3494601 this is his first big international fight like this so i think he did a great job and we are looking forward to his fight on thursday night
3494602 the european boxers box with a lot of force a lot of strength and last night he couldnt get through
3494603 i actually felt they were underscoring us i had the match at at least 9 or 10 2 in our favor but of course they have been underscoring the caribbean countries and the african countries john had to really box tonight or else they would have taken it away from us
3494604 im going to spar with a boxer from the bahamas who has a similar style to the korean and im going to help him out because the guy hes fighting has a style like me so we are helping each other out

3494645 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed

3494703 je weet niet wie het ergens voor het zeggen heeft dat maakt het werk van een journalist erg gevaarlijk
3494704 elke vorm van autoriteit ontbreekt in regios als osseti en abchazi en iedereen heeft wapens
3494705 maar we zijn te weinig in zulke gebieden de berichtgeving is te fragmentarisch dat is een extra veiligheidsrisico
3494706 wij moeten immers beelden hebben een cameraman moet altijd een stapje extra doen
3494707 je hoort vaak dat schutters dachten dat de camera een wapen was je kunt je er iets bij voorstellen dat op grote afstand die twee niet even makkelijk te onderscheiden zijn

3494718 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3494719 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3494720 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3494721 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3494722 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3494743 im writing to you and other blogging pastors because i have a question only a pastor can answer ive been growing increasingly aware of how difficult the job of pastor can be i know that pastors often receive a lot more criticism than encouragement and that can lead to all sorts of bad feelings i think though that most congregations truly love their pastors but dont understand how much encouragement is needed or how to practically provide that encouragement i also think that pastors are generally and understandably reluctant to ask for such encouragement or display any human weakness at all i personally love my pastor and im keenly aware of many things that beat him down in his ministry most of those things are entirely out of my control or influence i would like to provide encouragement to him myself and incite others to do so as well but i know enough to know that i have no idea exactly what issues a pastor faces that members of the congregation could alleviate i just dont know what to do or how to go about providing the most effective encouragement for him my request to you is that you respond listing some practical ways a congregation can encourage their pastor i really want to know this and i want the flock to stop being unaware of their shepherds humanity and needs

3494749 a game im not interested in can be 100 000 hours long and i dont care maybe if it was one hour and all the attention was put on that one hour the game might be something i could get interested in meanwhile if something is awesome but too short i dont feel value for my investment the goal is to find the sweet spot

3494768 part of it is political parties are a distant analog to families and you really hate to step outside a family environment
3494769 a single endorsement does not hide the fact that sen obama has no record of achievement beyond the confines of his party
3494770 while john mccain has spent his career putting the country first ahead of personal and party interests sen obamas record is a lesson in partisanship
3494771 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3494772 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3494773 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3494774 he also recognizes that its preferable to speak with potential adversaries rather than simply shun them

3494780 there was a lot of smoke thick black smoke everybody was pretty much horrified
3494781 people should ask themselves whether they think its possible that various members of congress have either something to hide or something that would embarrass them politically that they dont want out it could be things that the congressperson or the journalist or the source wants to achieve or are planning to achieve that the government can manipulate by blocking it by frustrating them by promising to them in other words this information would enable the government to intimidate or blackmail or manipulate every member of congress every official who might be tempted to reveal criminality people like the ones in the nsa who knew that criminal action was and is going on this law is intended to legalize it basically and to continue the cover up to conceal it you cant have a democracy with the state the executive branch having that kind of information total information about the about every communication every credit card transaction the fax e mail telephone conversations of everyone and as far as we know thats whats being collected right now
3494782 what started as a protest within the obama camp has grown into a non partisan group dedicated to restoration of the 4th amendment and the entire constitution
3494783 the two party system was never anything just two political factions fighting over jobs money influence and power we have only one political party the party of property which has two right wings republican and democrat and thats it there are no great differences

3494844 with the redesign it also appears as if facebook has remembered its primary purpose to be the best social networking site in the world

3494882 i think that with the footage weve got someone will know who this individual is and wed certainly like to have a talk to him about his bladder problem
3494883 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3494884 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3494885 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3494886 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3494887 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3494888 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3494889 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3494890 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3494891 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated

3494899 si jes s neira no hubiera intervenido no hubiera ocurrido nada en ning n momento son malos tratos
3494900 considero que las cosas se tienen que hacer por la v a judicial pero he decidido intervenir hoy sobre todo por las injurias y calumnias que se han dicho

3494904 necesit bamos que esto ocurriera nosotros y toda la sociedad porque es injusto indignante e incre ble que estuviera en libertad
3494905 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3494906 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3494907 i believe that they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the eu mediation
3494908 i want to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and its people
3494909 we will continue to work diplomatically on this matter and will continue our discussions with all the parties involved
3494910 that the thoughts prayers and support of the american people are with that great little nation as it struggles today
3494911 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3494912 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3494913 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3494914 like many im astounded at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate but i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
3494915 a time when to be different was to be damned
3494916 youll be begging for a body bag if it means a ride home
3494917 very very very happy to report her condition is upgraded
3494918 that was very meaningful to them and i hope a very good sign
3494919 ive talked to my mum quite a bit and the phones ringing and theres a lot of media interest and of course its just my mum in christchurch shes not equipped to deal with something of this magnitude not that shes not capable its just that its so surreal that all of a sudden she gets drawn into this
3494920 we have a small family in new zealand but were tight i know shes hurting and shes very much a part of the broader picture
3494921 our two families were very close and it is a good in law relationship shes rocked its hard for all of us
3494922 volleyball is my job my family is my life so that distinction has been very easy for me
3494923 i am passionate about the game my job i enjoy coaching volleyball has been wonderful to elisabeth and i but at this stage its very easy for me to focus on the task at hand which is taking care of my immediate family
3494924 once weve got it taken care of we can look at other things in life but right now thats purely where my focus is
3494925 stood for all the right things and he lived them
3494926 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence there is no indication that there was an pre meditation it seems unfortunately to be a case of the wrong place at the wrong time certainly in our opinion that is the way it seems to be
3494927 certainly the team has been influenced by this its not exactly how you would want to prepare for your first match having to deal with a tragedy of this nature

3494933 based solely on several private and informal conversations judge sovis had with the victim as well as several telephone conversations judge sovis had with mr mcdonald
3494934 threatened mr mcdonald with further court proceedings and exchanged profane and improper words with mr mcdonald
3494935 have no contact with judge sovis or the dakota county resident
3494936 we are glad to see cnpc participating in the beijing olympic games as an official partner in the category of crude oil and natural gas
3494937 we will transport oil and gas by whichever route is profitable
3494938 we are opening the caspian route at the request of turkmenistan
3494939 existing technical legal environmental and other risks relating to the trans caspian project are so great that it would be impossible to find an investor
3494940 unless this is a political project and then it does not matter what would be inside the pipeline as long as it exists
3494941 if these claims are substantiated and if the turkmens find investors to produce this gas the possibility of the trans caspian pipeline remains on the table
3494942 if politicians really have a strong desire to get more gas that would bypass russia they could offer to incur some financial losses and risks
3494943 we take our responsibility in the world energy supply very seriously
3494944 esto significa para m y para nosotros una tremenda responsabilidad y un gran desaf o que es estar a la altura de las expectativas de todos esos millones y millones de chilenos y chilenas que han puesto en nosotros sus esperanzas para una vida mejor
3494945 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3494946 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3494947 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3494948 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3494949 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3494950 i have a recommendation but its not of a person and i shared this with them back in march
3494951 wait till the democrat convention is over and see who they pick youll have more information
3494952 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3494953 ive been farming for 33 years and this was probably one of the hardest springs ive had putting a crop in
3494954 i just planted it wet and hoped mother nature would keep sending the rain to get it up
3494955 honest answer there were times last season when the fans were singing certain things at certain games and i wanted to join in i really did
3494956 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3494957 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3494958 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3494959 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3494960 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3494961 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3494962 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3494963 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3494964 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3494965 a lot of environmental activists still have not come to accept that the humans are also part of the environment
3494966 we need your help to get this film into theatres and schools across the country to defeat al gores lies and exaggerations
3494967 not evil just wrong is the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3494968 al gore has raised us 300 million to bombard the world with his message that all the energy in the us should be renewable in 10 years he is even running his ads during sponge bob square pants our children are watching this propaganda and are being forced to watch
3494969 please help us as much as you can to get this film out now
3494970 give me the money and ill be right back with the dope
3494971 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3494972 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3494973 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3494974 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3494975 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

3494979 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3494980 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3494981 we were nearly there last year almost won the carling league cup almost won the premier league almost won the champions league very close but it wasnt enough
3494982 we have to raise the bar this year and set ourselves the bar to win the premier league to win the fa cup and get back to the final of the champions league and win it
3494983 i can sit here and give them credit but it doesnt make it easier seeing them with that premier league trophy that we had sort of made ours we obviously want that back that is what we are aiming for
3494984 i think they know that every year we are going to give them a run for their money
3494985 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3494986 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3494987 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3494988 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3494989 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3494990 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3494991 i think the two strikers are top class and on the same level as anyone
3494992 both players are clever and it is clear that if they play together for a long time it will be easier for them to develop an understanding i think they will be okay and can show their quality
3494993 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3494994 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3494995 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3494996 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3494997 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3494998 the door is shut now the players cant go full stop
3494999 clubs are trying to unsettle some of my players i dont like it its my first job in the premier league and the last thing i want to do is sell my best players
3495000 benni is definitely one of them and theres plenty more as far as im concerned the situation is closed theres always going to be speculation about players but i can categorically say 100 per cent that nobody will be leaving this club
3495001 robbie is okay hes fit but he just needs to get his sharpness and ive told him that
3495002 he will always score goals if we can get him right then theres no reason why he cant play a part in the season if you look at teddy sheringham he played until he was 41
3495003 a self developed artist robert hardgrave creates work both highly intricate and abundant with personal symbols inspired by experiences from disease and recovery his paintings and drawings reflect ideas of reincarnation and the richness of life beyond death
3495004 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3495005 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand

3495017 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3495018 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

3495047 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3495048 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3495049 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3495050 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3495051 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3495052 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3495053 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3495054 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3495055 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3495056 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3495057 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action

3495066 here is where we can do everything out in the desert that we dont want to do in our own backyards in the city
3495067 the idea that were going to sacrifice critical pieces of our environment to protect other pieces of our environment seems a little ironic
3495068 thats an irony i cannot accept we have to find a way to do both
3495069 its not just businesses that have slowed things down its not just republicans that have slowed things down its also democrats and also environmental activists sometimes that slow things down
3495070 they say that we want renewable energy but we dont want you to put it anywhere we dont want you to use it

3495079 yeah we had to whoop a nigga ass for like a hour straight
3495080 the church has been very cooperative with us in our investigation
3495081 according to the church salazar and click have been on and off with that church for several years
3495082 only game coming out that i dont care about is the conduit
3495083 i said i was not excited for wario land as i already own it
3495084 in order to do the speed swimming i also had to agree that i would stay and do synchronized swimming and that became my love

3495087 it was her wish for me to have good luck in china
3495088 they say barack im a republican but i support you
3495089 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3495090 strong record s of bringing people together from the left and the right to solve problems
3495091 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors
3495092 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3495093 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3495094 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3495095 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3495096 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3495097 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3495098 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3495099 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3495100 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3495101 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3495102 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3495103 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3495104 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3495105 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3495106 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3495107 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3495108 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3495109 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3495110 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3495111 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3495112 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3495113 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3495114 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3495115 is also still as great as ever with a factor of 2 at both high and low latitudes
3495116 because we have not had recent climate changes of the magnitude forecast for the rest of this century
3495117 we can have greater confidence in the multi model mean changes than in that of any individual model for climate change assessments
3495118 it is doubtful that averaging different formulations together will end up giving the right result
3495119 model responses e g tropical land precipitation can often be of different signs and there can be little confidence that averaging them together will produce a better result
3495120 at this point we cannot determine the low and high latitude sensitivities and we have no real way of obtaining them our italics
3495121 affect the confidence we can have in many of our projections of atmospheric dynamic and hydrologic responses to global warming
3495122 forecasting even the large scale response to climate change is not easy given the current uncertainties
3495123 regional responses may be the end result of varying influences in part due to warming in different tropical and high latitude regions
3495124 real progress will be the result of continued and newer observations along with modeling improvements based on these observations
3495125 there is no guarantee that these issues will be resolved before a substantial global warming impact is upon us
3495126 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3495127 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3495128 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3495129 its better that the us do the drilling than china or cuba it will be a lot safer
3495130 he has a voting record to the left of vermont sen bernie sanders and sanders is a socialist
3495131 for me the issue is israel with obama you get louis farrakhan and rev jeremiah wright coming in the back door to the white house
3495132 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3495133 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3495134 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3495135 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3495136 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3495137 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3495138 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3495139 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3495140 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3495141 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3495142 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3495143 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3495144 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3495145 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3495146 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3495147 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3495148 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3495149 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3495150 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3495151 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3495152 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3495153 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3495154 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3495155 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3495156 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3495157 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3495158 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3495159 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3495160 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3495161 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3495162 there is no evidence that he planned or premeditated that event
3495163 the fact that somebody intended to kill somebody is also an element of second degree murder
3495164 what in your opinion is the length of time it takes to form premeditation
3495165 its the same opinion as in the laws of tennessee
3495166 its not the length its the state of mind and the issue of any planning that arises
3495167 this man was sitting in his own home on his own porch when the gun battle ensued
3495168 there is dispute as to whether the gun battle was the fault of one or two other people
3495169 his involvement does not begin at all until other people are shooting at his brother and hes being shot at as well
3495170 the only reason he didnt kill anybody was that he was just not a good enough shot or not lucky enough to hit them
3495171 theres no proof any shots were ever fired in the direction of clifford leon houston
3495172 he looked at all the other forces but that didnt look like a challenge for him
3495173 he loved his job and he loved what he was doing
3495174 he helped me through things and i helped him he always used to say his dad was his hero but hes our hero
3495175 he had lots of dreams but the only one he wanted was to make sure that child grew up to be the best
3495176 he just challenged himself to explore all areas of the theater
3495177 he challenged himself to act he wasnt afraid to go outside his comfort zone
3495178 he was only married exactly one month to the day before he was killed
3495179 he joined the marine corps because thats what he believed in he had the chance to be discharged and he said no he wanted to go to iraq he was very very proud to be a marine just a very outstanding young man
3495180 hopefully next year ill be down there with you guys
3495181 the evidence must demonstrate something more than the normal life changes both good and bad that occur during the life of a child and there must be at least some evidence that the material changes have had or will almost certainly have an effect on the child
3495182 no me gustar a usar el parteaguas pero esa es mi definici n de esa producci n que me trajo s lo bendiciones y logros

3495207 who will be the next president of the united states
3495208 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3495209 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence

3495214 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3495215 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3495216 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3495217 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3495218 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3495219 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3495220 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3495221 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3495222 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3495223 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3495224 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3495225 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3495226 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3495227 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3495228 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3495229 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3495230 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3495231 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure

3495244 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3495245 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3495246 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3495247 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3495248 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3495249 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3495250 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3495251 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3495252 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3495253 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3495254 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3495255 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3495256 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3495257 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3495258 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3495259 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3495260 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3495261 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3495262 the u s senate is one of our forefathers most brilliant democratic inventions
3495263 to preserve our vibrant democracy for future generations i believe it is critical to have a place where citizens can go to learn first hand about the senates important roles in our system of government
3495264 after a couple meetings i think well be able to pull that off by the end of the year
3495265 and thats not a credit to me thats a credit to his life people are so receptive to doing something in his name after hes done so much to help other people
3495266 this will be like a presidential library but even better in that it covers a longer era
3495267 and while presidents can do things by fiat senators do it by creating alliances and a team approach both scholars and our students will be able to learn about that process have access to the educational facilities there and the world class speakers who will be attracted there
3495268 you are so fucking beautiful that looking at you makes me feel like our souls are dancing together in an ocean of love and chocolate
3495269 it was just so awful to sit through that wretched rendition of blablablablabla something else pretentious
3495270 beneficiar a los pacientes y enaltecer la practica de la medicina
3495271 los altos directivos de las grandes firmas decidieron poner las cosas en orden
3495272 los medicos no se instruyen por si mismos sobre nuevas drogas
3495273 el paciente necesita saber si el medico le indica un remedio basandose en las sanas practicas medicas o en las atenciones del fabricante
3495274 hacen que los consumidores quieran esos remedios y luego le hacen grato al medico prescribirlos
3495275 el honorario fue una compensacion por el tiempo que nos concedieron
3495276 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3495277 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3495278 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3495279 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3495280 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3495281 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3495282 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3495283 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3495284 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3495285 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3495286 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3495287 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3495288 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3495289 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3495290 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3495291 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3495292 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3495293 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3495294 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3495295 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3495296 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3495297 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3495298 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3495299 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3495300 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3495301 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3495302 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3495303 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3495304 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3495305 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3495306 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3495307 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3495308 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3495309 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3495310 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3495311 we felt like the upside for us from a business standpoint was to wholesale it to affiliates
3495312 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3495313 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3495314 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3495315 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3495316 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3495317 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3495318 estaba tan acostumbrado a arrodillarse que en los viajes en las posadas despu s de las fatigas del d a y del camino mientras los hermanos dorm an y se entregaban al descanso volv a a sus genuflexiones como a su propio ejercicio y ministerio
3495319 con tal ejemplo m s con los hechos que con las palabras ense aba a los hermanos a orar de esta misma manera
3495320 hechas las dichas devociones a la virgen bienaventurada unos se arrodillaban cien otros doscientas veces entre el d a y la noche y dec an otras tantas veces el avemar a
3495321 en primer lugar el novicio despu s de los maitines de la bienaventurada virgen medite y considere con ardor los beneficios de dios a saber sobre la encarnaci n nacimiento pasi n y otras cosas en general y despu s diga el padrenuestro y el dios te salve mar a despu s de completas recuerde los beneficios de dios de la forma indicada al principio de estos modos de orar y podr tambi n a adir salve regina etc con otras ant fonas y oraciones de la bienaventurada virgen
3495322 hablando de l con tanto calor y atribuy ndole tales virtudes por sus preces y meditaciones que compendiaba en l lo m s esencial de la vida cristiana
3495323 constantemente afirmo predicar el salterio no es otra cosa que inducir al pueblo a devoci n penitencia desprecio del mundo y reverencia a la iglesia
3495324 x games 14 surpassed all our expectations both on the field and across all of our global multi media platforms reaching a record number of fans said rick alessandri managing director x games franchise
3495325 its clear that fans around the world have embraced these athletes and our events
3495326 athlete of the games via expn com and mobile text voting
3495327 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3495328 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3495329 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3495330 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3495331 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3495332 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3495333 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3495334 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3495335 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3495336 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3495337 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3495338 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3495339 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3495340 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3495341 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3495342 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3495343 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3495344 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3495345 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3495346 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3495347 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3495348 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3495349 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3495350 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3495351 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3495352 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3495353 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3495354 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3495355 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3495356 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3495357 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3495358 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3495359 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3495360 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3495361 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3495362 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3495363 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3495364 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3495365 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3495366 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3495367 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3495368 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3495369 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3495370 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3495371 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3495372 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3495373 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3495374 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3495375 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3495376 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3495377 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3495378 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3495379 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3495380 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3495381 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3495382 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3495383 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3495384 yes theres a new necronomicon by donald tyson its a hoax of course
3495385 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
3495386 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
3495387 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
3495388 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
3495389 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3495390 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3495391 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3495392 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3495393 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3495394 just so you all know we did set a record
3495395 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3495396 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3495397 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3495398 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3495399 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3495400 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3495401 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3495402 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3495403 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3495404 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3495405 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3495406 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3495407 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3495408 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3495409 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3495410 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3495411 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3495412 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3495413 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3495414 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3495415 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3495416 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3495417 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3495418 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3495419 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3495420 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3495421 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3495422 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3495423 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3495424 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3495425 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3495426 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3495427 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3495428 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3495429 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3495430 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3495431 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3495432 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3495433 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3495434 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3495435 the audience will understand that its in the national interest

3495446 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3495447 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3495448 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3495449 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3495450 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3495451 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3495452 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3495453 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3495454 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3495455 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3495456 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high

3495460 i really cant adlib in front of a group of people so im just going to recite verbatim what i have written on each slide okay
3495461 no you should explain what it means on the slide what if someone only reads the powerpoint slide
3495462 then why dont i just prepare a word document with all the pertinent information and email it to everyone
3495463 oh my god people do you realize what this means
3495464 im sorry i only understand information presented to me in a circle
3495465 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3495466 one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first
3495467 i meet and talk to these people i am not a professional psychologist but i am sure i can help people with my own experience as an ex victim of slavery i suffered a lot of domestic violence
3495468 i was forced to work for a man my former husband who treated me like a slave so i feel i know the subject maybe even more than many others and am ready to help people with all my heart
3495469 sometimes we artists actors and musicians are able to bring more public attention to a problem than officials or politicians we speak the language of emotions and feelings
3495470 the one thing we can say with some certainty is its the tip of the iceberg
3495471 he beat me up cut me with knives and there was sexual exploitation as well all kinds of bad things one day i was fed up and couldnt bear it any longer
3495472 my main message when i was talking to these poor girls who suffered so badly because of their naivety was do not feel sorry for yourself

3495476 our goal is to embody the entertainment side of a geeks life and our pages are filled with the kind of things youd see when you go into a geeks room and look on their shelves on their desk or under their bed
3495477 create a place where we could collaborate to share not only our own thoughts and opinions but those of like minded geeky individuals out there who deserved to be heard
3495478 in recent years the connotation of geek has changed to that of a positive nature anyone who is a geek is proud of it so its definitely been reclaimed by the geek community
3495479 geek culture is becoming more mainstream and more accepted thanks to the great box office success of so many film adaptations of comic book properties but eventually mainstream audiences will forget about
3495480 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
3495481 i took a little bit of pride in the state being first in something that is good decent and right
3495482 the existence of the gaylesbian alliance on this campus is an affront to the state of alabama its citizenry this university and its students
3495483 soon he was on the payroll at 10 an hour and he quickly advanced from there as early as july 2007 godwin was named a special administrative assistant earning more than 39 000 a year within nine months of arriving as an intern godwin was kings executive assistant drawing more than 57 000 a year close to what entry level lawyers earn in the office
3495484 another story thats out there right now a story that eventually youre going to have to answer to a story that eventually youre going to have to address so i figure im going to be the one who asks the question there have been these rumors all over the blogoshere there are rumors everywhere i get them every single day i dont see it going away i see it getting worse worse and worse and the rumor says that you were caught with a male aide i e john godwin by your wife she threw you out of the house because you were gay and that there was some sort of problem going on there is there any part of that rumor any part of it
3495485 hey dale to this point the answer has been the same as it is today i dont discuss rumors

3495533 hungry mass comparable to if not incarnating the growing consumerism of 1950s america
3495534 their complacent desire to stuff themselves with goods and good times had shown itself to be a monster
3495535 thats such a relief it feels like ive got a monkey off my back as this wins been a long time coming the team have worked so hard so its great to finally give them the reward for it obviously it wasnt the way i wanted to win it with shane byrne falling off but i was reeling him in after hed pulled a bit of a gap through backmarkers so i felt the win was mine it also made up for the disappointment of the first race i was slowing down to come into the pits when shakey caught me and knocked me down at very slow speed this fires me up for the rest of the season and im looking forward to cadwell park
3495536 im very disappointed overall in the first race it was a stupid crash in pretty dodgy conditions really half wet half dry i hold my hands up to it as it was my mistake as i hit a wet patch it was my fault the second race was a lottery really with the conditions and on tyre choice and we made the wrong one on the sighting lap i realised so we had about a minute to get onto the spare bike with slicks and unfortunately we were too late and had to start from the back of the grid on about the wettest part of the track i carved my way through but was disappointed not to finish higher up especially on a day when i so wanted to get a double win
3495537 another win in superstock is great but once again jon kirkham has finished second so ive not got as much advantage out of it as i would have liked still its brilliant to win again on the 2008 fireblade and were getting closer to having a two race cushion in the points in supersport ive won before so its frustrating to finish 11th i expected a win to be honest but i got a poor start which is my own fault the tall first gear we run to get out of the hairpin doesnt help and we bogged down off the line that was pretty frustrating and it took me a lap or two to make up some ground between now and cadwell park i will be training hard to be in the best shape for the next round

3495540 i have no doubt that barack obamas leadership is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
3495541 barack obamas platform is a call for change but the change that he is so gracefully articulating is more renewal than departure it is rooted in very old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition theres an emphasis on individual rights fairness and balance at home and progressive internationalism
3495542 for me the national interest comes before party concerns particularly internationally
3495543 we do need a new direction in american policy and obama has a sense of that
3495544 he recognizes that a long term occupation of iraq is not only expensive its extremely dangerous to the american interests
3495545 i have no doubt that barack obamas leadership is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for

3495553 for i have never been to the emerald city but my father went there once when i was a boy and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country although nearer to the city where oz dwells the country is beautiful but i am not afraid so long as i have my oil can and nothing can hurt the scarecrow while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the good witchs kiss and that will protect you from harm
3495554 we must protect him ourselves if he is in danger
3495555 dont you dare to bite toto you ought to be ashamed of yourself a big beast like you to bite a poor little dog
3495556 ive always known it but how can i help it
3495557 i dont know im sure to think of your striking a stuffed man like the poor scarecrow
3495558 it astonished me to see him whirl around so is the other one stuffed also
3495559 when they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back what is that little animal you are so tender of
3495560 oh hes a curious animal and seems remarkably small now that i look at him no one would think of biting such a little thing except a coward like me
3495561 i suppose i was born that way all the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave for the lion is everywhere thought to be the king of beasts i learned that if i roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way whenever ive met a man ive been awfully scared but i just roared at him and he has always run away as fast as he could go if the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me i should have run myself im such a coward but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me and of course i let them go
3495562 but that isnt right the king of beasts shouldnt be a coward
3495563 it is my great sorrow and makes my life very unhappy but whenever there is danger my heart begins to beat fast
3495564 you ought to be glad for it proves you have a heart for my part i have no heart so i cannot have heart disease
3495565 if i had no heart i should not be a coward
3495566 i am going to the great oz to ask him to give me some
3495567 and i am going to ask him to give me a heart
3495568 and i am going to ask him to send toto and me back to kansas
3495569 for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage
3495570 for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts it seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily
3495571 but that doesnt make me any braver and as long as i know myself to be a coward i shall be unhappy
3495572 to look where i step for if i should kill another bug or beetle i should surely cry again and crying rusts my jaws so that i cannot speak
3495573 have something to guide you and need never do wrong but i have no heart and so i must be very careful when oz gives me a heart of course i neednt mind so much
3495574 the plane just did a nosedive straight down to the pavement

3495576 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3495577 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3495578 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3495579 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3495580 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3495581 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened
3495582 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3495583 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation
3495584 i really wanted to try and do a story thats like a straight superhero story but everybody is a horrible irredeemable villain
3495585 we really wanted to stay away from something that had been a bit overly done it kind of came about from the fact that i had a bunch of character names and half ideas that were kind of interesting and i started to realize that they kind of fit together it was a case of not having exact analogues of familiar horror characters but they were in that familiar territory i did watch a lot of that particular kind of bad horror film when i was a kid growing up
3495586 the others are quite comfortable with what theyve been doing and who they are
3495587 at the same time youre really rooting for them thats the other thing about those b horror movies although the villain is the villain hes the one youre there to watch youre not there to watch the teenagers trying to kill freddy krueger youre there to watch freddy krueger
3495588 the other thing about necessary monsters is that im trying to work in a number of spy tropes and hes the classic agent gone rogue
3495589 i find chapters a useful way of thinking about stories it gave me more practice in writing issue length stories which is something i havent done much of
3495590 ive been leaning more towards print for the last couple of years because i wanted to tell longer stories and print still seems to be the best way to do that and possibly get paid for it its difficult to tell a long story where the focus is on the long form and do that as an online comic its possible but its not an easy thing to do so it seemed to me that it made more sense for something like this to lean toward print
3495591 the best way for getting the print comic out there and getting people to read it i think is the graphic novel but because we have this long life between creating the thing and getting it out to people it can take six months to a year to get it drawn so it seemed the best method for releasing it was to serialize it on the web and then when its complete you go to print with it id never had the chance to do that before
3495592 i wanted to have the publisher in place before i went online because i felt that it would set me apart from a lot of the other comics on the web theres a huge number of very strong comics on the web already and i wanted this to be seen in a slightly different light thats why i approached larry young of ait planet lar and pitched it to him as a graphic novel and then pitched it to him as the idea of updating this online first i really do see more and more people doing it
3495593 in the course of creating the story ive gotten more ideas for the world
3495594 as much as anything the thing holding me back from definitely writing more is partly that im not sure what sean azzopardi wants to do its a real collaborative comic and i dont want to make him sit down and draw another 100 pages afterwards i think well get the book finished and into shops and if it really takes off i think id definitely like to do more stories with it but its kind of easy for me being the writer because i can take on several projects at once

3495658 esta obra semelhan a das restantes inicia se com a desagrega o do quotidiano textual identificado pelo paratexto desta forma em vez de lermos na calendariza o com que a autora introduz cada um

imediatamente a no o de noite uma semana um m s um ano de noites ib esta substitui o do dia pela noite indica um afastamento do paratexto diar stico em que se escreve a obra um falc o no punho implicando assim a anula o de hierarquia de entradas para que o calend rio geralmente nos coloca este processo de substitui o do dia pela noite torna todo o procedimento de escrita irreconhec vel por

todos os mundos poss veis possam ter uma exist ncia nesta entrada o leitor despe se n o s do eu que ainda o assimila a um determinado estere tipo como tamb m perde a sua pr pria identidade como leitor ao aceitar o anonimato da escrita llansoliana expondo se a um grande risco perante o espa o que chega com a escurid o a noite a que llansol faz refer ncia tem muitas semelhan as com a de s jo o da

3495687 i joined a couple of apartments together and did internal non structural refurbishment
3495688 every single person who did a refurbishment had the sign off from the executive committee of the owners corporation which was acting on best advice and in good faith
3495689 i am happy to comply with whatever rules and regulations are appropriate and anything the council now puts forward i dont think any resident would say anything to the contrary
3495690 there is a lot of anger in the building about the amount of noise and dust from the work the fact the lifts are used by builders and that the building managers and concierges spend too much time chasing after workmen to be able to do their jobs properly
3495691 major work including removing walls subdividing and consolidating apartments generally requires council consent to ensure correct safety amenity and construction processes are followed
3495692 works undertaken without first gaining council consent can be subject to fines and orders requiring the works to be rectified and can require development applications be lodged to seek consent for ongoing uses
3495693 pier 6 7 is in the walsh bay wharves precinct conservation area which is listed on the state heritage register this means that development consent for most works is also required from the heritage office

3495703 this certainly appears to be the most publicized bug for vmware so far and i think it is damaging to vmware and virtualization as a whole the hypervisor is the lowest software level on the server and if you have an issue like this boom all your infrastructure is down
3495704 software will always have bugs but a widespread issue like this that affects all vms is really damaging especially at this point in time where virtualization is starting to take off vmware is going to have to fix this fast provide an explanation and outline what they will do to strengthen their qa in the future

3495709 rapidly rising health care costs are not simply a federal budget problem
3495710 growth in health related spending is the primary driver of the fiscal challenges facing state and local governments as well unsustainable growth in health care spending also threatens to erode the ability of employers to provide coverage to their workers and undercuts their ability to compete in a global marketplace
3495711 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act

3495726 the demographics of canton said it would make a good location for a school
3495727 we just opened our school in october so were not at full enrollment yet its always to get from zero to as full as possible
3495728 based on the curriculum and the philosphoical beliefs for educating young children
3495729 they dont let anybody in versus at the ymca where it was more than just a childcare center so it was open to other people
3495730 here even if you see some random person taking a picture in a parking lot they are on video camera and they have a security system in the door where the parents have to push in a code to get into the door or the directors let them in
3495731 the portfolios are something that starts shortly after the child begins and depending on their age
3495732 they have curricular goals that they should be learning and advancing in and we just collect their work and then make records of it and take pictures of examples they carry the portfolio with them until they leave and then they can take it with them its just to show their work and its also a requirement of the goddard school system
3495733 when i first found out that they were searching our cars it made me mad because i felt kind of invaded
3495734 i know that we dont have many rights since were kids going to school but it made me feel like my privacy was being invaded in that they have full authority to just come and search my car if they wanted to
3495735 i think its necessary for cops to do that every once in a while because it makes the school more safe
3495736 if kids want to do illegal stuff like that they should do it somewhere else
3495737 i felt that if they really wanted to get the true story they should have went into the lockers because thats where it would have been not in the cars
3495738 i really dont think theyre going to find much until they come inside the school
3495739 a lot of the kids think they have no right to search me and we have every right
3495740 i had a student who was reported to have brought a weapon to school he didnt end up having one but he was bragging that he had a knife and he wouldnt open his backpack he was screaming at the police you have no right to search me and they took him down to the ground and searched him they have every right to search him like they have every right to search us
3495741 automobiles on school property are subject to search by school officials if there is any reasonable suspicion that any illegal or unauthorized materials are in or on the automobile
3495742 on one hand it is school property and it is a schools job is to promote a good learning environment

3495747 we are well ahead of the state average and we saw a lot of improvement in certain areas
3495748 weve gone up in a few flat in a few and decreased slightly in a few but no real problems
3495749 there were a couple of flat spots and we always like to see it moving up upwards but thats understandable
3495750 when you first take the test sometimes your scores are around 75 or 80 percent you can make some changes in instruction and go from 75 to 85 so youre seeing a 10 percentage point growth
3495751 however once you get to around 90 its pretty tough to move from 90 to 91 or 92 and thats where were at so you dont see these tremendous gains but its really positive when you can say that 9 out of 10 west middle school students are achieving at a high level on the meap test
3495752 you have the state department of curriculum the various curriculums of math science social studies and language arts
3495753 they state what they think is important for kids at certain grade levels to know certain bench marks thats what the meap test is based on so now we know if thats what they expect us to know then thats how theyre going to test us on the meap test
3495754 so we dont really do much to go out of the way in order to prepare them we will talk about the structure of the test so theyre not surprised by that give them an idea of whats coming but typically we just try to adhere to the curriculum
3495755 they arent allowed to use resources they would typically be allowed to do theyre not allowed to peer edit which theyd be allowed to do so i dont think its an authentic measure
3495756 its too early to tell really we have to wait until we get the data back for all the schools and then well analyze it
3495757 we can analyze individual data and provide changes as needed we get information broken down all the way to school to classroom to individual results

3495768 each painting springs from my initial impressions however unlike most impressionists i am unable to resist the richness in shadow and colors as i see them i am also unable to resist the challenge of making a three dimensional object look realistic within a two dimensional medium i strive to capture the form of an object as it emerges into light and express it in terms of paint

3495774 the bulletin has been removed prior to todays bulletin release because of a last minute quality issue
3495775 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3495776 because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3495777 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3495778 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3495779 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else

3495858 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3495859 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3495860 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3495861 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3495862 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3495863 last night i was walking on court street near union and there were two ladies walking in front of us wearing long flowing huge robes with hoods they were carrying flashlights and had an air of authority about them

3495868 if european teams are going to use their unique advantages to try to pick off the top talent in the nba then the association needs to be proactive and sit down and think really hard about ways they can make some changes that can improve the financial situations for the players while also maintaining the associations competitive balance
3495869 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3495870 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3495871 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3495901 we are citizens of an age as well as of a state and if it is held to be unseemly or even inadmissible for a man to cut himself off from the customs and manners of the circle in which he lives why should it be less of a duty in the choice of his activity to submit his decision to the needs and the taste of his century

3495920 equine encephalomyelitis and west nile virus infection are easily preventable the vaccines are effective and you should be vaccinating your animals every year preferably in the spring before the first mosquito hatch
3495921 even in areas where we dont normally have a lot of mosquitoes theres been a bumper crop this year we know that west nile virus is going to show up every summer and now we know we have mosquitoes carrying the eee virus mosquitoes stick around until the first killing frost so we could have months ahead of us when theres a risk of mosquito borne illness if you havent vaccinated your horses for both eee and wnv do it now if youve already vaccinated them consult your veterinarian about boosters
3495922 we always recommend that veterinarians administer vaccinations and get a look at the animal to check for clinical signs especially this late in the season when most mosquito borne infections could already be present

3495924 the borrower is the ultimate decision maker when it comes to choosing their lender
3495925 as a result of theses competition limiting agreements uninformed borrowers were directed to first magnus when better fha mortgage terms may have been available from other lenders
3495926 this practice is a violation of respas prohibition of referral fees in exchange for fha mortgage business
3495927 first magnuss practice exposed huds insurance fund to unnecessary risk due to brokers originating and processing fha mortgages based on volume without ensuring due diligence that the home buyers received a mortgage that was appropriate for their needs
3495928 accordingly hud should require that all current and future practices of issuing incentive payments to brokers for originating and processing fha mortgages be discontinued

3495932 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3495933 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3495934 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3495935 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3495936 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand
3495937 i felt i was no longer going to allow people to get away with bad behavior i was very nervous about my job situation

3495939 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3495940 someone might say he feels bad but how do you measure that
3495941 sometimes we have cases that you could call exceptional but thats not enough
3495942 its pretty disappointing when you work for years and years and then see the miracle get rejected
3495943 ever since the period of the apparitions medicine has played a crucial role first of all as far as bernadette was concerned when dr dozous the lourdes physician detected she was physically healthy and mentally sane and subsequently with respect to the first people who had benefited from the blessing of a recovery
3495944 but the number of healed people continued to grow tremendously and it was therefore necessary to consider in each on of these event the subjective and objective elements
3495945 dr dozous had recorded more than a hundred cases in the year 1858 only and canon bertrin over 4000 statements of recovery between 1858 and 1914 ever since 1859 prof vergez an associate of the montpellier faculty of medicine had been put in charge of a scrupulous scientific control of recoveries dr de saint maclou succeeded him in 1883 year in which he established the bureau m dical in its official and permanent organisation dr boissarie another major personality in lourdes succeed the latter upon his death in 1891 and maintained the position until the first world war
3495946 in 1948 mgr th as bishop of tarbes and lourdes decided to lay down supplementary rules and indications which were even clearer and more logic in terms of recovery acknowledgement for the medical practitioners of the acknowledgement office taking into account three basic criteria a was there really a disease b is there a real recovery c is there a natural explanation for this recovery at the same time while medicine became scientific under the chairmanship of prof
3495947 leuret the national medical committee was established in 1947 made up by university specialists in order for a more rigorous and independent control to better guarantee the authenticity of the conclusions
3495948 it is impossible to estimate the number of cures which have occurred at lourdes there are healings of a spiritual nature such as faith conversion acceptance joy there are also the psychological cures freedom from anxiety release from addiction and compulsion there are cures of a physical nature the only type investigated at lourdes and also the only type accepted in the beatification or canonization process because evidence of both the past and present condition can be presented
3495949 in the last one hundred years over 6 500 individuals have reported cures to the medical bureau of these at least 2 500 cases are considered truly remarkable but they lack some requirement needed to allow them to advance to the next stage witnesses evidence lack of agreement on the nature of the ailment in the last twenty years there have been reports of about twenty cases of extraordinary cures or healings about one a year mr b lys healing is the 66th cure occurring at lourdes which has been officially recognized by ecclesiastical authorities the recognition by church authorities has been a feature of lourdes for a total of sixty three years of its history
3495950 the first occurs when the cured person is examined at the lourdes medical bureau established in 1883 the medical bureau receives the testimony of the cured person of the doctor and of those who accompanied the person to lourdes after the preliminary examination the cured person is usually asked to return to lourdes a year later for another examination many cases remain at this first level because of the difficulty of gathering the previous medical reports a frequent occurrence with individuals who come from underdeveloped areas
3495951 sufficiently documented cases are passed on to the international medical bureau
3495952 at present the final stage in the process is the investigation by the diocesan canonical committee appointed by the bishop of the diocese
3495953 the history of lourdes has been written entirely by doctors
3495954 in the name of the church i recognize and acknowledge in public the authenticity of the cure which mr jean pierre b ly experienced at lourdes on friday october 9 1987 this sudden and complete cure is a personal gift of god for this man and an effective sign of christ the savior which was accomplished through the intercession of our lady of lourdes
3495955 later i took my first steps just like a baby who is learning to walk

3495958 this was a particularly nasty incident and unusually a weapon was used against a member of the public which resulted in him receiving a stab wound to his stomach
3495959 the robbery took place during the lunchtime period and there would have been plenty of people in the area at the time
3495960 i would appeal to anyone who was in the area and may be able to help us with our inquiries to come forward as information they have could be vital
3495961 my big interest is in automobiles that was my whole life
3495962 i got that one from hawaii and that one from a friend
3495963 on the way home he stopped the car and said you drive it home
3495964 it was an adventure for me that was a big thing
3495965 you have to go along with whatever comes up and do what you can
3495966 i always wanted to get into a garage and work on cars
3495967 preliminary information suggests that the police did not engage in a pursuit of mr guliker
3495968 he had his mind made up he was going out
3495969 he began going downhill into depression it was getting worse and worse he was getting violent at home
3495970 it was just something in his brain he was never the same he didnt care anymore he just wished he was dead
3495971 he felt useless he felt like his family didnt need him anymore
3495972 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3495973 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3495974 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3495975 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3495976 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3495977 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3495978 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side
3495979 we are not at the end of tunnel yet but more indicators are starting to look as if we are at least getting closer to it

3495987 we served them last evening to our repeat customers who were staying in top notch rooms
3495988 we wanted to delight our customers and also wanted to wish producers good luck
3495989 they said the grapes were not excessively sweet but fresh delicious and juicy

3495991 nicole cooke has just secured team gbs first medal and what a medal
3495992 its not only gold but its team gbs 200th gold medal from the modern olympic games
3495993 if that flag really does represent turkish cypriots as claimed how is that the cyprus olympic team introduced by christofias does not even have one turkish cypriot on it he should explain why a single turkish cypriot is not taking part in the olympics
3495994 i fully support the olympics in china the peoples republic of china deserves to play host to the games
3495995 food prices are not abating and the worlds most vulnerable have exhausted their coping strategies
3495996 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3495997 at the markets we have been buying food it has become just too expensive
3495998 a lot of markets just dont have any food to buy
3495999 as a result we are not able to buy food in ethiopia anymore
3496000 at a local level food prices are increasing and that of course impacts on our programs making them more expensive
3496001 it means that we have to increase the amount of money we are asking from our donors
3496002 in kashmir thousands have already been killed in similar circumstances and this is in no way the option to resolve the crisis
3496003 it has exposed indian democracy and also the administrations double standards in dealing with situation in srinagar and jammu

3496010 if anyone forgets and eats and drinks then let him complete his fast because it is allah who fed him and gave him to drink
3496011 indeed allah has freed my ummah from the burden of mistakes forgetfulness and what they do under duress
3496012 whoever is overtaken by vomiting then he does not have to make up that day whoever vomits intentionally must make up a day
3496013 is it not so that if she starts menstruating she does not pray nor fast
3496014 this used to affect us and we used to be commanded to do qadaa for the fasting and not for the salaat
3496015 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3496016 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3496017 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3496018 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3496019 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
3496020 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3496021 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
3496022 although its more like a one two three four punch

3496067 in several areas mud and rocks from the mountains have buried entire villages
3496068 the search effort has been difficult because we dont have equipment and the digging has to be done manually
3496069 we are trying our best but we really think they have all died their bodies might be buried below the rubble and they could even have been swept away down the red river
3496070 today i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun

3496072 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3496073 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3496074 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3496075 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3496076 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3496077 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3496078 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3496079 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3496080 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3496081 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3496082 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3496083 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3496084 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3496085 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are
3496086 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3496087 we are committed to continuing the effort to try to reach a joint israeli palestinian document
3496088 perhaps the most obvious political effect of controlled news is the advantage it gives powerful people in getting their issues on the political agenda and defining those issues in ways likely to influence their resolution
3496089 make men wise and by that very operation you make them free civil liberty follows as a consequence of this no usurped power can stand against the artillery of opinion
3496090 the man who does not do his own thinking is a slave and is a traitor to himself and his fellow men
3496091 freedom of expression is the well spring of our civilization the history of civilization is in considerable measure the displacement of error which once held sway as official truth by beliefs which in turn have yielded to other truths therefore the liberty of man to search for truth ought not to be fettered no matter what orthodoxies he may challenge
3496092 freedom to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much that would be a mere shadow of freedom the test of its substance is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing order

3496253 my immediate goal is to win the starting job for the western force and hopefully play some really good consistent rugby next year
3496254 there is plenty of competition in the halfback position at the force with chris oyoung and justin turner but ill do my best to put my name up there during the pre season and take it from there
3496255 drew and i were roomies when we were in queensland so im looking forward to playing with him again as well as sharpie nathan sharpe and gits matt giteau and the other boys
3496256 its a talented squad and a great coaching staff and im very much looking forward to getting over to perth and making the most of my opportunities

3496259 hes a young australian on the rise and for him to win a match at the olympics is a big deal
3496260 we respect the fact they are a really good side but were looking forward to taking them on
3496261 we think and we know we can beat them for us its a big challenge
3496262 were not going to be intimidated by them but were going to go out there and give it a crack and look forward to it
3496263 im really looking forward to the game and i know the guys are you see a really big challenge against a team like this and one that could really shape our season
3496264 weve been pretty lucky with the way the results have fallen and now the ball is firmly in our court with three games to go
3496265 if we can win two or three of them we can really get ourselves up for another crack at it
3496266 its up to us now theres no excuses and theres no point on relying on other games weve had our luck in that respect its up to us
3496267 geelong are doing everything right and certainly look on course to put their name out there in respect to teams like that
3496268 were happy to take them on wherever i think anz stadium is going to be really good its going to be a finals type atmosphere on the ground and if we can get a big crowd out there it should help
3496269 its a good question hopefully roosy swans coach paul roos has got a few things to tell us this week a few secrets
3496270 they are just one of those sides that they havent got any real major weaknesses you can pick out they are really good all over the field
3496271 they dont rely on any one forward and as a defence coming in against a team like that it makes it pretty difficult to plan
3496272 theyve got threats everywhere and probably one of the biggest advantage of our defence is we can be pretty versatile and we are going to have to be this week

3496321 during these tough economic times it can be a real stretch for families to provide backpacks and school supplies for their kids especially if they have more than one school aged child we dont want parents to have to choose between putting food on the table or making sure their kids are ready for school
3496322 the simple act of giving a child the tools he needs to be ready on the first day of school can help alleviate a lot of stress for families
3496323 dont just sit there and waste your precious time when you want to do something do it right away do it when you can its the only way to live a life without regrets

3496336 i do all of my production including sampling replaying a sample and final mixes in apple logic studio
3496337 normally i run at least six to 10 tracks of the exs24 sampler in every session
3496338 once i was happy with how the basic sample was sounding i could go on building from there
3496339 i wanted to give myself as many sequence patterns as possible to distract from the repetitive nature of the melody
3496340 its funny because even though i liked that there is a timpani in the sample it was annoying the shit out of me at first
3496341 the only other outboard gear i use to mix is my mackie 24x8 console
3496342 as for mixing down what i really trust is testing the mixes in the car on the laptop and in the cheap ass iphone headset thats where it counts i know my room and get shit crackin in there with ease it also sounds great in a big studio but the world listens to mp3s and i need to make sure its sounds big on some small shit
3496343 as soon as i heard the sample i knew i had to make this track with krs or not make it at all
3496344 what happened when he came through later that week was possibly one of the biggest highlights of my career

3496346 i have known the glazer family for 50 years and they are people with the utmost integrity and who have a great passion for the business the strategic joint venture of our two leading organizations each with a great history will create the most capable and effective u s distributor network in the business fortified by the combined efforts of the team members of both our companies
3496347 as we celebrate our 100th year of business next year the joining together with southern wine amp spirits allows our company to progress to the next level we are excited by the enhanced prospects for growth for both companies and believe there will be considerable benefits for all stakeholders involved
3496348 my family and i are extremely excited to be working side by side with the chaplin family and southern wine amp spirits whose reputation for forward thinking and strategic foresight is so similar to ours
3496349 the combination of the resources of our two great companies will bring greater scale and synergies to the marketplaces we serve and therefore allow us to be better partners to both our suppliers and our retailer customers given the highly competitive landscape at the distributor level and the ever more consolidated marketplace at the supplier tier we believe the time is right for a more national type distribution footprint together we expect to be able to create significant value for all tiers of the beverage alcohol industry we are confident that greater value will be created by simplifying the way to market for suppliers creating lower go to market costs via our new arrangement and improving our national on and off premise account penetration
3496350 both companies on their own have an incredible amount of momentum this combination will only accelerate through the adoption of best practices gleaned from both organizations creating the most dynamic strategic joint venture in the industry in addition our talented team members from both companies will continue to serve the same customers who have come to rely on our superior service over the years
3496351 with the establishment of southern glazers distributors of america our two companies will create an historic management and operations services venture this new strategic joint venture will draw upon the experience and expertise of two of the countrys leading distributors southern glazers distributors of america will have increased capabilities to better serve suppliers and customers and will be well positioned for future success both companies have exceptional teams of talented and experienced associates we are both extremely excited to work with melvin a dick who will serve as senior vice president of the new venture
3496352 i look forward to working hand in hand with the glazer team to help create the greatest wine and spirits distribution company in the united states
3496353 i am thrilled to work alongside mike maxwell who will serve with me as executive vice president and chief operating officer operations and plan on bringing the national scope of our two organizations together we both realize that the key will be local execution for our supplier partners and that part of the organization will be benefited by the focus of bringing the best elements of both companies together this strategic joint venture will create an organization capable of delivering the highest standards of sales operations and service excellence in the industry to each and every critical sales channel we are dedicated to serving on behalf of all our supplier partners we will know we are successful when this transition is seamless to our customer base
3496354 the national synergies and economies of scale of our new company will allow us to better compete in the highly competitive and ever changing industry landscape in the united states brad and i will lead a dedicated team that will include lee f hager and cary rossel the two new co executive vice presidents and chief administrative and accounting officers of the strategic joint venture that will oversee the integration of the two organizations
3496355 the reality of creating the strongest leadership team behind wayne and jerry and brad and mike will give us the ability to execute for our supplier partners and realize the potential that exists for our brands and our strategic joint venture this new strategic relationship will be backed by a powerful association of two exceptionally successful companies coming together to create the foremost distributor in america one that will help us compete more effectively and provide better stability for our employees and suppliers for the future

3496377 they had been in the stein valley for 18 days
3496378 they had been out of food for three days they werent properly equipped they didnt have a map the male was wearing hiking boots and jeans the female didnt have proper hiking boots either
3496379 they got about three quarters of the way and thats where the country gets a lot more rugged and very steep
3496380 it was at that point they decided to turn back so they had about three quarters of the journey to hike again they didnt meet any other hikers along the way that could help them out

3496382 weve been there since they kicked us out of the property across the bridge when the new bridge came through we were told we had so much time to get our boat out of there there was about fifteen of us over there that got kicked out
3496383 theyve really given us no option on what to do theyre taking that boat away from our children i hope theyre happy theyre taking something away that is very important to our family
3496384 theyre making us look bad by calling us freeloaders when i think of freeloaders i think of the homeless downtown with no place to stay

3496386 due to unforeseen circumstances the catalytic cracking unit a key part of gasoline production at edmonton refinery had to be shut down last week
3496387 this has limited the supply of gasoline forcing petro canada to temporarily reduce the volume of gasoline delivered to customers and associates as a result customers in alberta and the interior of british columbia may notice outages of gasoline at some petro canada retail sites
3496388 the laws in b c at this time the court of appeal has ruled that a motorcycle operator may wear anything on his head that could be construed as a helmet since 1987 they have not renewed the section of approved helmets because of that ruling our members of legislator and the general public have to start speaking out
3496389 my understanding with insurance companies right now if you are involved in a motorcycle crash and are wearing one of those toy helmets they will null and void your insurance coverage for medical expenses and that includes icbc
3496390 do they realize a hospital stay can run between 1 000 and 10 000 a day if their insurance isnt going to cover their expenses
3496391 cigarettes have been determined they cost us too much with our health benefits and everything our insurance is increased because people smoke the government realizes that which is why theyve increased the tax and the cost of the things and passed legislation limiting purchase of the things i think its time the government both provincial and federal realize these helmets are starting to cost us in the same way
3496392 the motorcycle shop guy says here you want something cheap quick and legal here you go all theyre retailer doing is pushing an inferior product the bottom line for them is to sell products they dont care i can honestly say a lot of them dont care

3496394 were tracking a similar drought pattern as we saw in 2003 and we urge everyone to be extremely cautious
3496395 we are getting into a warmer pattern following the heavy rain we got over the weekend the weather is going to stay on the hotter warmer side for the next couple of weeks which is about as far ahead as we can reasonably predict
3496396 when you look back at the weather from 2003 as a whole starting from january it looks very similar to what the whole weather for 2008 looks like however when you just look at the summer weather then you see differences in summer of 2003 between june and august the kelowna area received 23 6 millimeters of rain since june of this year kelowna has received 51 millimeters almost double the amount
3496397 weve doubled the membership in the program since the initial group signed up and members are now able to market everything from certified pulpwood and sawlogs to balsam boughs and burls

3496405 weve heard of some people going door to door in ozaukee county and telling people that this is the only way to save their trees
3496406 thats really misleading theyre cherry picking data to make that statement
3496407 if you have a greater than 40 percent dieback in the canopy its not in your best interest to try any kind of rescue treatment
3496408 at that point its very difficult for that tree to recover
3496409 we have very good research data that shows the area of highest risk is within 10 12 miles of a known infestation
3496410 outside of that area i really dont think theres a need to treat
3496411 we have time probably until next may before the adult insects begin to fly to make an informed and appropriate management decision

3496424 we started in my garage two years ago and were producing barrels today so things are moving pretty quickly
3496425 so these are bacteria that have been engineered to produce oil
3496426 they started off like regular lab bacteria that didnt produce oil but we took genes from nature we engineered them a bit and put them into this organism so that we can convert sugar to oil
3496427 if youve got something that you can make work in a test tube thats good but youve got to be able to make it work on a very large scale to have an impact on our petroleum imports
3496428 what weve done is make the same molecules from renewable sources so that it can go into the existing infrastructure be made domestically and in an environmentally friendly way thats the goal
3496429 you cant put ethanol in a pipeline and even your car needs some adjustments to it whereas the product were making is going into the existing system and thats a big difference
3496430 i doubt were going to completely eliminate our dependence on oil but well certainly be able to supplement the amount of oil we need in the short term
3496431 i think that the answer to reducing our petroleum import problem and reducing the carbon emissions from transportation is really threefold
3496432 it involves replacement fuels like biofuels it involves using much more efficient vehicles than we use today and it involves driving less
3496433 the fun of the challenge from the science perspective is that you do have farmers and biologists and entomologists and biochemists and chemical engineers and process engineers and business people and investors all working to solve this and it ranges anywhere from a political issue to a technical issue
3496434 honestly i couldnt think of a more exciting thing to work on as a scientist or technologist right now
3496435 part of the excitement comes from the fact that this is such a complex problem it cant be solved by a farmer or an ag expert and it cant be solved by a chemical engineer or a chemist
3496436 we all have to pool our various talents and training and try to come up with a whole new system of producing energy
3496437 and the current energy price environment has made literally everyone interested in replacements for petroleum

3496443 the entire bay area is correcting for the frothiness in the markets that occurred from 2003 to 2006 where by all rational economic accounts the market was outpacing what youd normally expect to see
3496444 tend to be some of the nicer parts that have higher priced real estate southern marin county such as tiburon and sausalito many parts of san francisco county and places that have benefited from proximity to successful technology companies such as palo alto and cupertino
3496445 areas of overbuilding have very steep price declines but on the coast and in areas where there is still significant employment growth prices are holding up because demand is stronger
3496446 that shows you the roller coaster ride in san francisco and how now youre coming down to more historically normal levels
3496447 you can see how exuberant the san francisco area got over the past eight years and as the winds were taken out of the sails as the market peaked what that looked like it was a more gentle decline from 2005 to 2007 then more precipitous declines beginning in early 2007
3496448 signs of stabilizing market would be that year over year declines are coming down
3496449 were not seeing substantial declines in year over year depreciation

3496451 were all looking for a turning point there are no signs of that at this point

3496529 first of all we dont believe anything that officials in mclennan county say anymore
3496530 the sheriff has taken 91 000 of personal money that goes into his bank account and then he says i am still able to decide i am still ok deciding whether it is in our best interest to privatize that old dog wont hunt nobody here believes that
3496531 we think inmates are being kept in jail to create an artificial public safety crisis so the hue and cry for a new jail can come and the new jail can be privatized and built by cec
3496532 by statute it is the sheriffs responsibility whether it was jack or larry that contract has not changed and up until 20 months ago we didnt have a prisoner in that jail so does that logic make any sense
3496533 we believe somewhere in that 170 pages will be some of the information that will tell the tale about how you get only one bid on a private prison
3496534 if they have nothing to hide then they have nothing to worry about if they have done nothing wrong then they should release it anyway

3496562 de todas formas en esto del sexo los hombres son muy evidentes el otro d a estaba esperando el tren y dos individuos se acercan y se paran justo delante m o y sueltan entrecortadas frases de este tipo ves lo que te digo si si realmente es muy bonita nunca hab a visto una igual y siguen de hablando de ese modo haciendo ver que se refieren a la bicicleta hasta que finalmente me preguntan es f cil de plegar evidentemente esbozo una sonrisa que justamente lo que demuestra es lo mucho que me cuesta sonre r y los ignoro seguro que pensaron que era una borde
3496563 pues yo lo veo muy simp tico no es tan molesto no ya no te voy a decir que sea divertido pero como m nimo han intentado montar una escena simp tica
3496564 es otra manifestaci n de machismo como otras muchas que hay esta es en el metro pero otras son en el trabajo en casa o en la prensa

3496566 pues yo no lo encuentro divertido no voy a decir que me sintiera ofendida ni molesta pero realmente es pat tico es una l stima que dos hombres hechos y derechos no tengan nada mejor que hacer que eso
3496567 pero silvia t nos quieres hacer creer que no tienes espejo en casa est claro que te vistes para estar atractiva tu ropa tu manera de hablar tu manera de moverte son medios de comunicaci n no solo comunicas con la palabra existe una comunicaci n no hablada e igual que buscas las mejores palabras para comunicar lo que quieres decir tambi n tienes que cuidar el resto de lenguajes pues puedes llevar a equ vocos al otro te arreglas te pones esa camiseta con un escote que casi permite que te veamos el alma y los tejanos esos no creo que te sienten bien por casualidad y tu trabajo te tiene que costar ados rtelos a la piel cada ma ana todo eso denota que te sabes atractiva y te gusta serlo en definitiva ese es el mensaje que transmites por lo que no puedes pretender que te aborden en el tren de la misma manera que si estuvieras leyendo cien a os de soledad y el reto de tus encantos estuviesen escondidos que quede bien claro no estoy haciendo una apolog a de que si una chica va ense ando el tanga los hombres tengamos derecho a tocarle el culo ni tan siquiera de que no se tenga que sorprender de que lo hagan creo que aqu todos partimos de la misma base de respeto

3496572 the comprehensive review of the ycja has given me a unique opportunity to hear from canadians and listen to their views and concerns about youth justice
3496573 although each region has its own distinct challenges there is also a shared desire to hold youth accountable through measures that are proportionate to the seriousness of the crime
3496574 today is just a bad day in financials jpmorgan being down that much is really creating the drag here
3496575 even the lower oil price is not helping the market today
3496576 even though the number of unit sales in new york city is much smaller than say florida the average price in new york is five times that of florida therefore on a volume basis we believe that new yorks share of foreign investment is almost as high as floridas
3496577 it is not surprising that foreign buyers are buying condos as they seek a form of ownership that provides the least trouble indeed that form is the condo
3496578 the extra purchasing power of the devalued u s dollar depressed real estate prices in florida and a continued strong canadian real estate market makes for a perfect window of opportunity
3496579 first time home buyers make up about 40 percent of the entire market
3496580 they dont have a home to sell and they bring demand to the market as more than 2 million anticipated first time buyers enter the market and claim the credit this will stimulate buying up the housing ladder
3496581 together the first time home buyer tax credit and foreclosure relief in the housing bill will help to reduce inventories
3496582 in turn this will firm up prices and send a signal that we are either at the bottom or very near the bottom and that there isnt a better time to buy than todays market
3496583 for the first time home buyer the market is very good the number of properties on the market gives them a much greater choice compared to a few years ago and with much more properties on the market it allows the buyer much more room to negotiate price
3496584 my only counsel is if we have learned anything over the years that first time home buyers should not overbuy they should determine what their needs are over their wants the high number of foreclosures in the county tell us that some people cut it too close you have to allow a little room for life to happen
3496585 the majority of first time home buyers will need 3 down a buyer can still get 6 percent seller assistance thats money up to 6 percent of the sale price of the house given back to the buyer by the seller to help with closing costs
3496586 in terms of first time home buyers we are seeing them stay in the 150 000 range and looking for starter homes that could have two bedrooms and one bath
3496587 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
3496588 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
3496589 we are delighted to welcome pat to his new role on the leadingre board of directors
3496590 he is one of the brightest minds in real estate and has been instrumental in the dramatic growth of the allen tate company throughout the carolinas over the past two decades
3496591 allen is an icon in the real estate industry and remains one of leadingres strongest advocates and champions of the independent brokers
3496592 as kauais premier real estate company we are very proud to have been chosen as the exclusive affiliate of christies great estates in the poipu beach resort area
3496593 this relationship will further enhance our ability to service our clients by gaining access to the extensive christies great estates marketing network
3496594 it is with great pleasure that i welcome pacific ocean properties inc to our network of exclusive affiliates
3496595 pacific ocean properties is the local luxury leader in kauai and their expertise exemplifies the christies great estates standards of quality and integrity
3496596 the second quarter is the sixth consecutive quarter of home value declines and we see little promise of turnaround in the short term as the rates of decline have yet to slow and in fact actually accelerated in many markets
3496597 the high rates of negative equity are having a direct effect on home sales figures as weve seen considerable growth in foreclosure transactions and homes selling for a loss unfortunately while there are a few bright spots like pittsburgh oklahoma city and austin that reached record high values most markets are likely to remain in negative territory for the next few quarters given the magnitude of current year over year declines
3496598 well sure craig can use statistics because he sells a lot of houses but what about me
3496599 i use local statistics to demonstrate my value as compared to the area average as an example if homes are selling at 96 6 of asking price and mine average 99 1 the seller will net 2 5 more by being listed with me we focus on this stat as well as average days on market and this allows me to list homes at a 7 commission nearly every time
3496600 part of our strategic plan is to double the size of our company in two years
3496601 among our first steps is to affiliate with a major brand to further increase the stature and reach of our organization we chose prudential real estate for its global brand strength its breadth of product and service offerings and its core values which are so closely aligned with our own
3496602 prudential real estate sets the industry standard for real estate technology and we plan to leverage all of its resources
3496603 our sales professionals will take their business and service to new levels using prudential real estates exclusive online advantagesm sales platform and our listings will gain significantly more exposure through prudentials robust internet marketing programs
3496604 were thrilled as weve wanted starck realtors to be a part of our family for many years
3496605 the company is extremely well run and thrives on a foundation of experience and service with integrity the combination of a strong local company aligned with a famous international brand will be difficult to beat in suburban chicago
3496606 our customers certainly know about starck realtors yet were probably one of suburban chicagos best kept secrets
3496607 the branding and image prudential real estate brings to our company will make us much more competitive this is really a proud and exciting time for our company
3496608 were expanding when others in our industry are pulling back
3496609 our clients need us more than ever in this challenging real estate market and were there for them with more tools and resources than ever before of course were positioning our company for long term growth as the chicago real estate market finds balance and turns upward
3496610 with starck realtors we now have as strong a presence in suburban chicago as we do in metropolitan chicago youre going to see the rock yard signs everywhere throughout chicagoland
3496611 our management team has looked at this affiliation from all angles over many months and sees this as a wonderful fit that benefits our sales associates employees and customers alike
3496612 the only challenge i see is in my own personal wardrobe ive got to replace all of my old red neckties with prudential blue ones
3496613 the war on talent is a reality and the real estate industry is feeling it more than ever nars lifting of the code of ethics on recruiting agents from other companies and the subsequent disappearance of the old gentlemens agreements of the past coupled with the recent market crash has meant that serious real estate companies must now concern themselves with the war on talent as other industries have done so since the 1990s
3496614 alignmark has always provided us with innovative tools for recruiting like the real estate simulator these webinars have taken their level of service to the next level at fillmore we can now follow up with our managers after they have attended a webinar and engage them in discussions on recruiting and retention the webinars help us to keep our managers accountable on their recruiting activities

3496618 we have an it team at stream with outstanding leadership that will enable stream to continue its growth and expansion to meet not only the needs of existing clients and prospects but enable us to expand our global markets with leading technology initiatives bob will continue to be based in our richardson texas location

3496623 were just absolutely flabbergasted that a man who has been collecting close to 24 000 a year in social security has called it a disgrace
3496624 may not get to see much of sen john mccain in person even when hes sitting no more than 40 feet from us on the plane hes still out of sight however his cardboard likeness is always watching over us when were in the sky
3496625 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency
3496626 john mccain stood up against george bush and don rumsfeld in the prosecution of the iraq war for many years
3496627 ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
3496628 id like to start out by giving you a little straight talk under the present setup because weve mortgaged our childrens futures you will not have social security benefits that present day retirees have unless we fix it and americans have got to understand that americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today emphasis added and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its gotta be fixed
3496629 getting out of iraq will require just as much resolution as it took to get in and the same kind of resolution a willingness to ignore the consequences

3496644 we looked at figures nationwide and we found that use of the therapy was extremely variable
3496645 basically a lot of people who should be getting the therapy arent and some of the people who are getting it may not need it
3496646 our findings parallel previous studies evaluating adoption of new medical technology in that they show racial disparity in who is receiving the newest therapies
3496647 in contrast to previous studies however we didnt find any gender gap in the use of crt
3496648 crt is an effective therapy for many patients and this study suggests clinically practice varies greatly compared to what it should be according to recommended guidelines

3496653 vladimir putins plans to make moscow an international financial centre may evaporate as the prospect of sanctions on the country rears its head western financial institutions which have done little to expose evidence of official russian corruption may start pursuing the issue much more publicly
3496654 georgia has made remarkable political and economic progress since the countrys transition to democracy
3496655 the only hope for preventing this crisis from becoming a calamity for russias relationship with the west is for moscow to immediately ceasefire pull back its forces and agree to negotiations brokered by the international community all steps that the georgian government has agreed to if the fighting continues this moment could emerge as a turning point in the wests relationship with moscow and deny russia the international standing it seeks that is not the future the united states or europe want but it is the future russia may get if it does not stand down and live up to its responsibilities as a force for progress

3496678 reiterates in the strongest possible terms that such behaviour if substantiated is wholly unacceptable
3496679 should be taken as soon as possible against those found to be involved in such misconduct

3496700 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3496701 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3496702 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3496703 this is a company that clearly has designs on that market space
3496704 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3496705 since quite a number of people who swing by my blog are either in marketing or public relations i wanted to address you specifically for a moment im writing to you as part of this new version of media one blogger not paid to blog not working for a newspaper or magazine outlet not especially beholden to the traditions that have come before im writing to you as a human being who likes people community innovation and business not to mention art creativity play and many other things i want to tell you a few things for you to consider
3496706 i will call you stupid for not knowing shit i just found out yesterday
3496707 foi uma demonstra o de for a dirigida a todos os que consideram que a r ssia pode ser ignorada
3496708 a r ssia n o tinha outra alternativa sen o responder

3496714 i always hide in the basement but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3496715 there were so many fragments i believe they use that kind of ammunition to hit infantry but they showered it on our heads
3496716 its degrading to have someone who just hired you to stick his hands down your pants
3496717 why didnt you turn around and knock him out right there
3496718 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv
3496719 which of my hundred ideas about this do i want to explore next
3496720 o k what else can i do along these lines
3496721 they were retreating it wasnt panic but they were trying to leave one by one not in groups
3496722 we dont have anything we dont have food we left when the shelling started with very few things
3496723 we dont know whats going on and why the russians did this to us they said they were defending ossetians who are they defending here
3496724 if the russians say theyre defending the civilian population why dont they care about kodori gorge
3496725 they dont know where theyll go we have no idea theres so much confusion
3496726 this would be good news but this is of course not enough
3496727 the issue is closed there is no discussion about georgias claim over south ossetia we are not going to see them any more there
3496728 we received all solidarity from the alliance for my country and i have the feeling there was full understanding of the deep and difficult situation
3496729 thats why we ask nato to reconsider the new circumstances and the new situation in terms of security in this area
3496730 eu em nenhuma hip tese cogitei ou admitirei monitorar qualquer pessoa com prerrogativa de foro leia se desembargador de tribunal e ministro do stf eu nunca fiz isso e nunca farei essa a verdade acreditem ou n o

3496740 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3496741 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
3496742 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
3496743 i am your nightmare i am the shape in the dark
3496744 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
3496745 i always hide in the basement but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3496746 there were so many fragments i believe they use that kind of ammunition to hit infantry but they showered it on our heads
3496747 yes i see how it is you have to keep up with your neighbor now watch i will show you how to water the flowers
3496748 be careful about reading health books you may die of a misprint
3496749 ive never felt ive been valued by anyone im just a waste of space that everyone ignores like a ghost without a home
3496750 law politics and the coming collapse of the middle class
3496751 i believe whatever doesnt kill you simply makes you stranger
3496752 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
3496753 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you
3496754 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3496755 we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3496756 i wish that i had followed it with all my heart
3496757 thought that they had not finished the investigation they hadnt considered all the evidence
3496758 im very grateful i survived this i didnt think i would
3496759 that secret church documents about these pedophile priests will be made public
3496760 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3496761 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3496762 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3496763 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3496764 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3496765 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3496766 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3496767 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3496768 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3496769 this means the solidarity of five states with the nation that has fallen victim to aggression
3496770 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3496771 we are saddened by that but we must accept the facts of life
3496772 we the leaders of once captive nations of eastern europe and now eu and nato members estonia latvia lithuania and poland express a deep concern over the russian federations actions toward georgia
3496773 why the heck i cant believe they actually did this
3496774 residents in the building swear they live longer because of this
3496775 why shouldnt the state put this somewhere else in our community not on such a prime site
3496776 we know what its like when our kitchens or bathrooms are being remodeled imagine having to pack up everything and leave for three or four months i really expected some residents to have great difficulty and i really havent had any its an amazing group of people here
3496777 attention out of range h 27 7 khz v 61 9hz
3496778 half of all insured americans are taking prescription medicines regularly for chronic health problems
3496779 an effective hdl booster already exists it is niacin the ordinary b vitamin niacin can increase hdl as much as 35 percent when taken in high doses usually about 2 000 milligrams per day and it has been shown to reduce serum levels of artery clogging triglycerides as much as 50 percent
3496780 niacin is really it nothing else available is that effective
3496781 if youre a drug company i guess you cant make money on a vitamin
3496782 americans buy much more medicine per person than any other country the biggest jump in use of chronic medications was in the 20 to 44 year old age group adults in the prime of life where it rose 20 percent over the last six years
3496783 the anxiety may stem less from the state of hebrew and more from the israeli state of mind
3496784 the state of israel has no confidence of its continued existence
3496785 the language may have moved on since the days of the prophets but perhaps the sense of doom has not
3496786 a poem does not bruise of course the way a truncheon bruises
3496787 but the maximalist mood in the palestinian community will matter much for the outcome and darwishs poem is a document of that mood
3496788 when i write a poem about my mother palestinians think my mother is a symbol for palestine but i write as a poet and my mother is my mother she is not a symbol
3496789 i have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighters gun
3496790 his death was received among palestinians with shock and despair
3496791 words cannot describe the depth of sadness in our hearts
3496792 keeping that balance between work and life is what keeps us sane
3496793 we forget to take the time to check our mental status and give it importance
3496794 that feeling of emptiness and exhaustion is a sign we need to tend to things
3496795 people tend to see it as indulgent and we have to change that
3496796 taking care of ourselves is fundamental and without that there is no physical health
3496797 some of the big bellwether financial services companies are precipitating the correction that were seeing
3496798 but given the rally we had last week were still holding on if you look at the big picture we were due for some kind of a break
3496799 the government and industry need time to improve the system and to scale it from limited use to the millions of private sector employees working for the federal government
3496800 federal contractors should not be subjected to any greater requirement than federal employees and today only new federal employees are required to be verified through the e verify system
3496801 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3496802 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3496803 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3496804 i think jomama has a keen understanding of government society most people war the media do gooders do badders evolution feminism marxism don and nalini and subatomic particles
3496805 the goal of a criminal investigation is to establish responsibility if there is of each and every one involved which is not the goal of a public inquiry
3496806 the investigation will be complete will be impartial it will be a fair investigation
3496807 the advantage of a public inquiry is that it will look for the motives that feed this hatred of the police system
3496808 the other advantage of a public inquiry is that we will be able to analyze the intervention methods of police
3496809 they are well inclined to keep a peaceful atmosphere to keep an open communication with the communities and the population should have confidence in the police department
3496810 this is not only about gang street members its about ordinary citizens who live peacefully in montreal north
3496811 whenever police see a black man or just see a young man police will stop him and try to get information from them and arrest them
3496812 after word of the police shooting spread a riot broke out in the neighbourhood sunday several cars were set o fire and one officer was reportedly shot in the leg
3496813 110lbs to patrol the area thats when the problem started it shows no itimidation
3496814 by 20 youths several of them reportedly rushing at police
3496815 this is too little too late and our investigation into morgan stanley continues
3496816 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3496817 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3496818 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3496819 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3496820 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3496821 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3496822 but in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once
3496823 i dont know how i can ever say that i am sorry
3496824 i will be sorry for the rest of my life
3496825 geopolitical concerns always provide good support to oil prices and this news should offer some relief to investors worried about exports of azeri crude from ports in georgia
3496826 the strong recovery in the dollar adds more pressure to the sector which is already suffering from fears over slowing global growth
3496827 while not ready to call an end to this years bull market especially considering the murky outlook for chinese energy demand and continuing weather and geopolitical risks the agencys assessment of increased supply and inventories from june to july provides some fundamental justification for the sharp fall in benchmark crude prices in july
3496828 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3496829 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3496830 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3496831 we cannot continue with a situation where hostilities are likely we must bring them to an end by having a permanent solution to the problem
3496832 it seems the eyes could be a window to look at the condition of small vessels throughout the body including the heart
3496833 its an opportunity to see damage that might be happening on the inside and help prevent it
3496834 that is a lot of people who may have early clues of a possible heart problem in their eyes
3496835 im so exhausted im ready to give up my grandparenthood
3496836 clearly chris has the ability to raise large sums of money
3496837 he raises large sums of money from the liberal left wing of his party the unions and the trial attorneys as you know are the people that primarily funded his campaign
3496838 the thing thats going to hurt chris the most is that there are many people in the democrat party that truly believe that hes a political opportunist who merely switched because he didnt think he could win a republican primary
3496839 i know jeff harris and margaret donnelly are not excited that he was successful in the primary and i think that therell be lots of democrats in the state that do not want to see chris koster elected as the attorney general
3496840 yet here a further question immediately arises who knows god
3496841 who is nearest to the fathers heart has made him known
3496842 god is the foundational reality not a god who is merely imagined or hypothetical but god with a human face he is god with us the god who loves even to the cross
3496843 when a man is entirely caught up in his own world with material things with what he can do with all that is feasible and brings him success with all that he can produce or understand by himself then his capacity to perceive god weakens the organ sensitive to god deteriorates it becomes unable to perceive and sense it no longer perceives the divine because the corresponding inner organ has withered it has stopped developing
3496844 it is very important for us to stick to experience without disconnecting ourselves from it for even an instant as soon as we disconnect ourselves we begin a discourse that is pasted on to life and we no longer understand anything what fr giussani taught us is a look that passes from appearances to the you the ultimate depth of everything of reality and therefore it is through what you do that you realize that you are lacking something that the desire for something other is reawakened this is what i mean when i say that the idea of mystery is lacking
3496845 in listening to someone who works in the city who earns loads of money and who after working a fourteen hour day goes home dissatisfied the question arose so what is life without the mystery without the deep perception of the mystery nothing gives satisfaction you will have seen it during vacation during leisure times without the perception of the mystery everything becomes a bore so either we help each other accompany each other to perceive the mystery or inevitably we too sooner or later will become skeptical
3496846 we are imprisoned or bored when the awareness of the totality of the mystery is missing
3496847 i feel imprisoned or bored because i am not made for anything less than the infinite its like a shoe that doesnt fit if we dont take a step forward in the conception of our i in the way we look at ourselves we are ultimately like everyone else with the same mentality we may add some pious exercise organize meetings to whatever we like but we have the same mentality as all the others since the i is relationship with the mystery if this does not become familiar then we are prisoners
3496848 should someone ask me whether i would indicate the west such as it is today as a model to my country frankly i would have to answer negatively no i could not recommend your society in its present state as an ideal for the transformation of ours through intense suffering our country has now achieved a spiritual development of such intensity that the western system in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive
3496849 on october 10 1982 a magnificent autumn morning found a quarter of a million people in st
3496850 before his conversion paul had not been a man distant from god and from his law
3496851 he realized that a new approach in his life was absolutely essential
3496852 the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
3496853 paul therefore no longer lives for himself for his own justice he lives for christ and with christ in giving of himself he is no longer seeking and building himself up this is the new justice the new orientation given to us by the lord given to us by faith
3496854 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3496855 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
3496856 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
3496857 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
3496858 do i really need to drive to such and such place
3496859 what are you doing next friday do you want to come to denver for a party
3496860 look charles i gotta do this if i dont ill be nothing ill end up like my neighbor ricky smith he just sits around crocheting all day and snorting nasal spray
3496861 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3496862 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees

3496864 thats the great thing about competition you beat us and well come back around the team that loses never forgets
3496865 we also understand this is pool play but at the same time this team right here weve lost one game in two years and greece is the only one to beat us so far so we definitely feel like we owe them
3496866 from that game ever since then weve been working on the pick and roll defense
3496867 its like a real good hitter in baseball sometimes you dont get hits and then all of a sudden you break out
3496868 usa in 2006 2008 is a great team we know that and we know its good for us to play in this high level
3496869 this is one of the games thats been in my mind
3496870 ive been looking forward to playing this game the last two years
3496871 had his people call the campaign to demand that the video be removed from youtube for copyright violation
3496872 we are still at a very early stage in the development of clean technology
3496873 most of the businesses will fail but scaleable solutions will also come to the fore that have not even been invented yet
3496874 unless for some reason they decided to build two separate mechanisms into the iphone to do this of which the other one is invisible this one likely feeds a master kill switch perhaps there is a special setting in the configuration file which can vaporize the app all together of course this is just speculation but as i said before it would be irresponsible to have a blacklist but only use it to kill gps applications
3496875 china is a fantastic place to start up a business
3496876 a lot of people might not like living here in the pearl river delta but for me it was like coming home
3496877 no deaths have occurred as a direct result of the use of its taser technology products
3496878 unique and comprehensive review of scientific research field reports and data on the use of tasers in police work in canada and around the world
3496879 henri j nouwen a priest born and educated in the netherlands
3496880 henri nouwen spent his life helping people respond to the universal yearning for love unity and communion that doesnt go away
3496881 today i personally believe that jesus came to open the door to gods house all human beings can walk through that door whether they know about jesus or not today i see it as my call to help every person claim his or her way to god
3496882 teaches a course on the spirituality of henri nouwen at fuller theological seminary
3496883 h e withdrew in order to look inward to learn how to love god and be loved by god
3496884 wordiness in prayer often subjects the mind to fantasy to and dissipation

3497094 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3497095 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3497096 i didnt want to lose my job because i felt i had to take a stand

3497149 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3497150 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3497151 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3497152 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3497153 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3497154 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3497155 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3497156 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3497157 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3497158 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3497159 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3497160 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3497161 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3497162 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3497163 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3497164 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3497165 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3497166 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3497167 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3497168 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3497169 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3497170 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3497171 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3497172 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3497173 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3497174 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3497175 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3497176 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3497177 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3497178 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3497179 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3497180 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3497181 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3497182 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3497186 while at amp t does not fundamentally oppose the transaction and believes competition benefits consumers the regulatory process must be consistent for all providers
3497187 we will continue to urge the and clearwire to the same competitive analysis standard under which it reviews all other carriers
3497188 transparent attempt to use the commissions spectrum screen to hamstring prospective competition to at amp t
3497189 claim before the commission that they really have only 55 5 mhz of useable spectrum for competitive evaluation purposes while simultaneously claiming before the investment community and the that their spectrum holdings will be at least three times that size
3497190 at amp t fails to point to a single competitive harm that would arise from the new clearwire transaction
3497191 allowing market forces to determine the manner in which clearwire should offer its services
3497192 game the regulatory system to tie down other with regulatory encumbrances while leaving its own networks and lines of business unregulated
3497193 is not in the same category of spectrum as the pcs cellular smr and 700 mhz bands that have been subject to the commissions cmrs screen in prior cmrs mergers
3497194 new clearwire will face competition from 4g service providers using 700 mhz spectrum
3497195 those who would prefer to preserve their marketplace positions are permitted to hinder the emergence of a strong broadband third pipe
3497196 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3497197 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3497198 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3497199 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3497200 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3497201 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3497202 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3497203 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3497204 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3497205 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3497206 who are open to doing something on the production side
3497207 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3497208 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3497209 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3497210 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3497211 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3497212 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3497213 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3497214 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3497215 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3497216 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3497217 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3497218 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3497219 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3497220 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3497221 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3497222 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3497223 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3497224 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3497225 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3497226 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3497227 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3497228 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3497229 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3497230 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3497231 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3497232 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3497233 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3497234 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3497235 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3497236 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3497237 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3497238 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3497239 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3497240 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3497241 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3497242 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3497243 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3497244 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3497245 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

3497284 probabilmente il caso di annullare la seduta consiliare convocata per domani che serve solo per tentare di approvare una variazione di bilancio volta a favorire qualche assessore ha proseguito ronghi assessori che sperperano i fondi europei usurpando un potere che proprio del consiglio cio quello della programmazione cos come emerso dalla gestione del parco progetti

3497751 enjoy the little things for one day you may look back and realize they were the big
3497752 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3497753 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3497754 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3497758 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3497759 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward

3497768 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3497769 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3497770 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3497771 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3497810 monmouth county is i think representative of the thinking swing voters in the county and to choose elected officials based on policies they advocate which is why i think theyll go with mccain by the way and why they went with jennifer beck
3497811 we need to make sure that people dont get caught up in the media frenzy surrounding barack obama and decide who to vote for based on the best interest of the people of this area and in that respect john mccain wins hand down he should get every vote
3497812 a very personal conversation about her husbands characteristics as a leader
3497813 i think the climate in new jersey with the poor economy makes mccains message very appealing he understands that new taxes are not the way to solve our countrys problems and that will absolutely resonate with the citizens of our state

3497821 i am pleased that speaker pelosi has indicated that she is willing to allow a vote on increased domestic drilling i have continued to pressure my leadership for a vote on offshore drilling and i am confident that my fellow members of congress still unconvinced on the need for more offshore drilling are hearing from their constituents while they are in their districts during august congress must include increased domestic drilling as a part of a comprehensive energy policy that prepares us for the future i look forward to working with republicans and democrats to pass legislation that addresses the energy crisis when we return to congress in september

3498132 moral dilemmas are the same now as they were in the beginning of time people are predatory and competitive
3498133 the issues today may be global warming and darfur but its the same thing we still dont like each other i always felt if the bigots got their way and they eliminated all the blacks and all the jews then they would turn on the next group of people and the next group finally when there were just two people left on earth the right hander would turn on the left hander

3498154 president bush made a very unkind remark in one of his speeches in the spring
3498155 when someone questioned him about where people without health insurance are going to go for care he said we have universal health care
3498156 the new people coming to the emergency department often have private physicians and private insurance particularly medicare and medicaid
3498157 but community physicians are not accepting medicare and medicaid patients who are instead being seen by government clinics or hospital clinics
3498158 if the beds in a hospital are filled patients cannot be transferred from the emergency department to inpatient units this can lead to the practice of boarding patients holding them in the emergency department often in beds in hallways until an inpatient bed becomes available it is not uncommon for patients in some busy eds to be boarded for 48 hours or more
3498159 i dont have enough hours in i got to have 1 100 hours for a full year before i get insurance for myself
3498160 he said you got to do what you got to do
3498161 when you call their office and they find out what insurance you have thats the end of the conversation
3498162 if youre on the husky program people get the impression youre less than acceptable
3498163 i would have to be in a lot of pain for me to come to any hospital i dont like to see sick people
3498164 the only reason i got insurance is because i have psych problems
3498165 this makes me never want to pick no more babies up again
3498166 i got one question for you if you were fishing how come there was no bait on your hook
3498167 we are just really trying to keep never gotten ahead
3498168 this is true of most emergency departments in connecticut and pretty much all big trauma centers we just cant get caught up it has been hopeless for the last 10 years or so
3498169 its not the glamorous stuff that kills you its the day in and day out grind that can wear you out
3498170 you may be built to handle 188 patients a day and staffed well but throw in a couple of hours of 20 to 25 patients registering and youre on pace to see 230 or 240 patients that day if you cant keep up with the flow you get behind the eight ball and patients accumulate in the waiting rooms
3498171 thats not bad but ill bet you that by 9 p m tonight well see the percentage of acuity level three get much higher
3498172 in the evening you tend to get inundated with the walking well and minor stuff
3498173 if youre an upper class citizen and youre sitting in the waiting room next to a family of folks you suspect are undocumented thats where you get exaggerated anecdotal evidence
3498174 people are a little hasty to make those kinds of judgments
3498175 come on please bear with me for five minutes i just want to make sure youre ok
3498176 just tell me what happened were you drinking using coke or something the doc who saw you last night said you needed restraints you were fighting you were delusional
3498177 so thats a person who looks like shes using cocaine or she just has a personality disorder and doesnt want to talk
3498178 promote the use of community based health centers by patients who go to hospital emergency rooms for routine medical needs clogging the urgent care system and driving up costs
3498179 its all geared to getting the patient to a more appropriate setting than the emergency room
3498180 we are trying to link them to a medical home and that will prevent them from coming back to the er thats the concept of this
3498181 we push them in different places theyre quick and easy
3498182 theres going to be a handful that might have some sleeper diagnosis that could be dangerous
3498183 its not appropriate to divert those people away every once in a while they look pretty good but have something thats potentially dangerous you cant let your guard down on folks who appear fairly good but could have a stroke or atypical heart attack
3498184 if someone wasnt dying i could just say zip upstairs and there always would be a place for them
3498185 if that happened we could see everybody including cant pay dont pay dont want to pay have insurance dont have insurance shouldnt be here might should be here thought twice about being here we could see all those people
3498186 im proud that no matter what the need is we help people

3498196 a researcher provided panicles of pearl millet for us to roll up our sleeves and destroy as we struggled to understand the best way to remove the grains from the stalk
3498197 ultimately we discovered the physics behind millet threshing we tried numerous iterations of threshing devices we tried using rubber brushes vacuums centrifuges and many odd materials to remove the grain
3498198 the key we discovered is hitting the grains at high speeds in the right direction
3498199 our idea is that a woman on a bicycle could carry on her back an extra wheel for the purpose of threshing when she reaches the field she could turn her bicycle upside down and change out the back wheel for threshing this gives mobility to harvesting
3498200 just knowing the mental health association i cant imagine it wont be a good thing

3498216 oh man when i dropped my version of the rocks peoples elbow on heavyweight fighter joe nameth in new orleans it didnt even occur to me that the moment would live on forever
3498217 it was just something silly i did to entertain the crowd but that clip has been circulating all over the world wide web landing on youtube and countless other websites in fact someone once told me that my impromptu elbow drop has been viewed by over half a million mma fans on six different continents including asia australia africa and europe and ive received interview requests from journalists all over the globe isnt that crazy
3498218 in my last fight against ricco rodriguez in houston texas i believe i became the first fighter in mma history to successfully land the karate kid crane kick in a live bout
3498219 thatll probably be popping up on the internet before too long as well it sure as hell took my opponent by surprise i guarantee you that mr miyagi wouldve been proud of me wax on wax off baby

3498222 shes with me 24 hours a day 365 days a year me and her are tag team partners for life and we wouldnt want it any other way see i know some people think that standing inside an mma cage and trading bombs with a heavyweight warrior is scary stuff but that aint nothin whats truly scary is contemplating a future where savannah is trapped in poverty stuck in a minimum wage hell for the rest of her life these kinds of thoughts chill my soul and at least once a week i wake up in the dead of night imagining a world that robs her of her happiness and childhood innocence as god is my witness i will never ever let that happen you just dont understand the rage a single father feels when he knows that the only thing standing in the way of a better life for his baby girl is that opponent standing before him it makes you want to just smash his skull in
3498223 dirty harry moskowitz is a six foot five inch 275 pound behemoth who fought on ufc 15 and ufc 17 and i made him submit in the first round yeah i know its easy to dismiss me because my professional record is 27 and 34 but my record doesnt tell you that i took my first professional fight just two days after stepping inside an mma gym for the very first time it doesnt tell you that i lost seven of my first ten fights mainly because i didnt know what the hell i was doing it doesnt tell you that i fought 19 times in just one year to gain much needed experience and to keep my family off food stamps it doesnt tell you that i traveled over and over again to my opponents hometowns and lost some outrageous decisions to corrupt local judges and it doesnt tell you that since 2005 my record is 11 and four see im not one of those trust fund babies whose parents provided private karate lessons ever since they were in grade school im a blue collar street brawler who stumbled across mma fell in love with the sport and had to do everything the hard way but nows my moment to shine my last opportunity to create an indelible legacy that my little girl will always be proud of after i chop down the giant everyone will know the name of johnathan ivey not because of the peoples elbow or something like that but because im now a legitimate top ten mma heavyweight and believe me there aint gonna be nothin accidental about it
3498224 no disrespect to anyone but im gonna win and gan is gonna wish he stayed retired
3498225 and incidentally doesnt hulk hogan live in tampa i know hes been to other xfc events in the past so hopefully hell be sitting ringside for my fight and maybe as a special tribute to the hulkster after i blast mcgee off his feet ill level him with a leg drop yeah i bet thatll look pretty cool on youtube too

3498227 heck i could just keep my mouth shut and ignore this again
3498228 its unfortunate that we have to let them go but again just like the recent release of our fifa team its a matter of politics and top 3 results they as a relatively young team did pretty well especially with their recent 3rd place at the i34 lan in the uk unfortunately the result comes to late they are all nice guys and i wish them all the best for the future
3498229 its been fun playing with the core of the team since i32 when cod4 came out up until a day or so ago there has been some really fun times and some not so fun times but everything has to come to an end i guess

3498240 we completely respect their right to protest but if that turns illegal then we have to call the police for their protestors safety as well as the safety of the people working on the property
3498241 we know that they arent planning on entering the site today so they are utilizing their first amendment right
3498242 it fulfills both of those purposes we want people to know what to expect and how to conduct themselves during a protest but we also want to get the word out about our cause
3498243 we have a really dedicated and hard working town watch and community groups in the 24th district and the communities we serve and protect have a great relationship with our police district
3498244 we wanted to reach out to the people who arent on town watch who do not attend community meetings regularly to come out and get involved in their neighborhoods

3498250 i also will get to spend some time here and see the olympic events and then go back up to beijing and see more there
3498251 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this injury was especially disappointing for me considering it forced me to miss the open championship british open and it comes in a ryder cup year
3498252 but taking proper care of it is my highest priority and im encouraged by dr weilands experience with this type of injury and his outlook towards my recovery and rehabilitation

3498261 i am thrilled with this new challenge and will continue to dedicate all efforts to the successful development of our deep pipeline especially the ongoing pivotal phase 3 program in benign prostatic hyperplasia with our lead compound cetrorelix
3498262 its notable that suddenly with output rising opec officials are concerned about adherence to quotas and oversupply
3498263 however as we look toward the fourth quarter of the year barring a more significant decline in demand the world is going to need opec oil to avoid a larger inventory draw than is normal for the fourth quarter pulling inventories at that rate would be very bullish for prices
3498264 i dont have enough hair to really be concerned with making a change
3498265 there is growing public concern over the surveillance state the telegraph eric pickles has been telling us that under the 2000 terrorism act a constable may apply for a warrant to enter premises to carry out a terrorist investigation but he then goes on to tell us that
3498266 laws passed by labour have slipped in draconian powers for bin police to enter family homes on top of this anti terror laws now allow town hall bin police to spy on law abiding citizens
3498267 it is wrong that whitehall is openly encouraging town hall bureaucrats to fine people for minor breaches like putting out rubbish at the wrong time or not closing a bid lid
3498268 our q2 financial performance was disappointing the desktop pc market around the world weakened during the quarter and our miscalculation of competitive price position further pressured our desktop gpu business we have a great product line up and having taken the necessary pricing actions we are strongly positioned again our focus now is to drive cost improvements and to further enhance our competitiveness through the many exciting initiatives we have planned for the rest of the year
3498269 in contrast the rest of our businesses did not exhibit the same dynamics as our desktop business the notebook gpu mcp and professional solutions groups grew a combined 27 percent year over year
3498270 though we approach the near term with caution we remain very optimistic about the expanding universe of visual computing and the exciting growth opportunities made possible by cuda our general purpose parallel computing architecture
3498271 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3498272 theyre a dangerous place to be but we are aware of the fact they have become prime targets for copper thieves were working hard to put a stop to the problem before someone gets seriously injured or even killed

3498275 people call in tips the citizens for a drug free walker county give us a lot of tips on illegal drug activity and that really helps us out
3498276 we recovered some more narcotics and we were able to make a couple of other arrests that werent drug related
3498277 we take these threats seriously theyre considered to be a terrorist act

3498285 its nice to have this suit dismissed before we even filed an answer
3498286 we like to vigorously defend against unjust accusations of patent infringement but when the provider of the product that is the subject of the infringement claims can resolve a matter it saves us the trouble of a courtroom battle
3498287 nothing has been achieved since they started the consultation process and yet they are spending like crazy
3498288 it was evident from the start that we were going to be against the proposed gcc but they went ahead with it anyway
3498289 its a shame that they have not achieved anything at all in terms of setting up the new council and we can now assess how much support the interim government has received so far
3498290 two years have passed and yet nothing has been done to rectify the problems were in
3498291 its obvious that a lot of people in the rural areas do not support the interim government and i know that for a fact because i was the chairman for the naitasiri provincial council
3498292 i had to change i feel good with where im at right now im very confident better late than never

3498294 about 25 percent of the u s corporations not paying corporate taxes in 2005 were considered large corporations meaning they had at least 250 million in assets or 50 million in receipts
3498295 the actual report reflects that of the 1 26 million u s corporations with no 2005 tax liability just 3 565 were large
3498296 thats 0 28 which is 90 times less than the figure reported by the ap policymakers and the public should not be deceived by this story that misrepresents the gao report
3498297 its time for big corporations to pay their fair share
3498298 these facts significantly undercut the thrust of the aps story which is that significant numbers of corporations especially large ones are avoiding tax liability
3498299 in fact the gao report shows that large profitable corporations are paying taxes on their profits

3498304 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3498305 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3498306 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3498307 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3498308 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3498309 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3498314 second quarter results reflect 20 sequential growth as seven of our ten largest customers increased order levels over the previous quarter and two newer customers began to ramp production levels
3498315 gross margins were adversely affected by sales mix higher labor and overhead costs in part arising from our two new facilities ramping production we undertook several planned cost reduction initiatives in the quarter to rebalance manpower levels and we addressed an asset valuation issue we lowered staffing levels at our chihuahua mexico site as planned production shifted to our new china facility the china site became fully operational in the second quarter we also adjusted manpower levels at our boston facility and selectively at other locations these actions resulted in an 800 000 restructuring charge related to severance in addition we incurred a 4 9 million charge to write down leasehold improvements at the boston site these restructuring initiatives will have the effect of lowering costs in future quarters
3498316 cash usage from operations in the second quarter of 4 6 million primarily arose from delayed payments from certain customers at quarter end these payments were received early in the third quarter
3498317 despite challenging credit markets we continue to improve our financing arrangements and lower interest expense in large part due to our track record of positive cash flow and earnings
3498318 customer order levels continue to be solid despite concerns about weakening of the north american economy for the second half of the year we forecast revenue and earnings above first half levels and we expect to generate positive cash flow

3498324 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3498325 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3498326 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3498327 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3498328 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3498329 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3498330 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3498331 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3498332 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3498333 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3498334 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3498335 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3498336 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3498337 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3498338 our second quarter 2008 results continue to show the improvement we noted in the first quarter particularly in terms of both revenue growth and positive ebitda as adjusted
3498339 our contract pipeline continues to be strong and we remain very encouraged about winning new contracts at both paragon and cornwall since the first of this year tri s has been awarded new contracts worth approximately 372 million over the contract terms and we intend to continue to build on this success
3498340 we remain excited with our financial performance this quarter and we are very optimistic about our full year 2008 results based upon our numbers for the first half of 2008
3498341 this is one of prologis single largest lease agreements for new inventory space in north america this year underscoring the strength of indianapolis as a national distribution hub and the prime location of this park
3498342 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3498343 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3498344 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3498345 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3498346 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3498347 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3498348 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3498349 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3498350 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3498351 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3498352 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3498353 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3498354 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3498355 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3498356 we are very pleased to report a strong quarter as both of our revenue and net income reached another record high due to our strong top line growth and the improvement in our gross margin
3498357 the outlook for our business going forward remains very strong as we continue to benefit from the industrialization and urbanization processes in china
3498358 in addition to our strong organic growth shown in our financial numbers and current backlog we have also seen significant progress in the implement of our expansion strategies we are very excited about our successful penetration into nuclear power plant sector where we were notified that we won a bid for a contract valued at approximately 7 3 million we will provide fire suppression systems for multiple nuclear power plants owned by a nuclear power group we also made preliminary progress in m amp a by signing a memorandum of understanding mou where china fire will become a majority shareholder of a fire protection special equipment company this special equipment company is expected to generate more than 25 million revenue in 2009 on the international market fronts we recently signed a partnership agreement with an india company whose principals have over 25 years experience in indias fire protection industry the partnership will provide local support for china fires epc engineering procurement and construction fire protection projects in india the partnership will also be responsible for sales of china fires fire protection products in india

3498364 our impressive jump in manufacturing production and new customer growth reflect our unwavering focus on expanding our commercial footprint
3498365 in the second quarter we strengthened our sales and marketing infrastructure achieving nationwide sales force coverage to respond to the growing demand for the omnipod system we also increased our direct to consumer marketing initiatives and in this quarter implemented a broad sampling program with our unique product demonstration kit looking ahead we continue to believe that our innovative and easy to use product is well positioned to address a significant unmet need in the diabetes therapy market
3498366 we are pleased with nortek second quarter performance as business conditions remained difficult in the companys core markets nortek continues to focus on cost reduction initiatives manufacturing efficiency improvements and strategic sourcing initiatives which together with some price increases have partially offset cost increases from commodities particularly steel and copper and transportation costs
3498367 the mortgage crisis has driven housing starts down to a level of less than 1 million starts this action has been amplified by high oil and gas prices and consumer confidence is at unprecedented lows while we expect the difficult housing market will continue throughout 2008 nortek plans to maintain its leadership position in these difficult markets while remaining poised for participation long term in improving home improvement and residential building markets
3498368 operationally we continue to make progress towards financial stability as demonstrated by the substantial improvement in our quarterly operating performance year over year reducing losses from operations from 2
3498369 on a sequential quarterly basis we continue to be encouraged by our improving ophthalmology revenues and the fact that we saw an increase in our aesthetics revenues in spite of the overall softening of the aesthetics market in 2008
3498370 we are pleased with ntk holdings second quarter performance as business conditions remained difficult in the companys core markets ntk holdings continues to focus on cost reduction initiatives manufacturing efficiency improvements and strategic sourcing initiatives which together with some price increases have partially offset cost increases from commodities particularly steel and copper and transportation costs
3498371 the mortgage crisis has driven housing starts down to a level of less than 1 million starts this action has been amplified by high oil and gas prices and consumer confidence is at unprecedented lows while we expect the difficult housing market will continue throughout 2008 ntk holdings plans to maintain its leadership position in these difficult markets while remaining poised for participation long term in improving home improvement and residential building markets
3498372 we are very pleased with the steady top line growth of our key products throughout the first half of 2008 based on positive market trends and the continued strong market demand we are experiencing for our products we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute on our business plan based on these factors and our performance in the first half of this year we are raising our revenue guidance for the full year 2008 from us 30 32 million to us 34 35 million in addition to the progress made towards our full year financial goal we have also made significant progress on the business development front notably the initiation of a strategic partnership with amag pharmaceuticals inc to develop and commercialize ferumoxytol and the rapid progression of our phase iii programs in our portfolio
3498373 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3498374 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3498375 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3498376 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

3498390 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3498391 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3498392 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3498393 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3498394 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3498395 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3498399 if youre not a good multi tasker you can get so far behind usually the people who cant do it quit within the first couple of weeks
3498400 its definitely something you really need to be trained to do
3498401 its not something you want to rush through i would say it takes at least a year to get fully trained
3498402 after youve done this for so long its almost second nature
3498403 child abuse and neglect can be found in ever community even the
3498404 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support out country
3498405 the tax system that allows this wholesale tax avoidance is an embarrassment
3498406 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3498407 how can i be expected to run fast when we havent done any workouts on the track
3498408 we have high expectations of finding oil in the dreki area since scientific research has indicated that valuable oil resources may be found there
3498409 we therefore urge all parties interested in new oil fields in northern areas to attend the conference in reykjavik
3498410 at the conference we will go through geological data on the area as well as inform on taxation and financial conditions
3498411 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
3498412 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
3498413 moreover prolonged viewing of media violence can lead to emotional desensitization toward violence in real life
3498414 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
3498415 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
3498416 why i love the baby of the man who raped me
3498417 every time i look at phoebe i know i made the right decision i never wanted to end my babys life just because of how she came to be
3498418 everyone save for mum thought i should have an abortion
3498419 my dad even made an appointment at the clinic and they showed me the little blob on the scan i presume to convince me that it was just a mass of cells and the whole thing would be over quickly
3498420 anyone my age would want to have a baby rather than an abortion
3498421 i did and i dont regret it for a moment
3498422 having her in my life is such a joy from the first time i held her in my arms i have had this fierce bond with her a connection which started even before she was born she looks like me when i was her age and i feel strongly that she was meant to be a part of our family
3498423 while it was terrifying knowing that i was going to be a mum made me look forward and focus on something else i suppose i have tried to look beyond what happened to the life that was created
3498424 pro life 101 a step by step guide to making your case persuasively
3498425 how should a civil society treat innocent human beings that remind us of a painful event may we kill them so that we can feel better put differently can you think of any other case where having been victimized yourself you can justly turn around and victimize another completely innocent person
3498426 if the unborn is a human being she should not be killed to benefit her mother hardship does not justify homicide hence we are back to the one question that trumps all others in the abortion debate what is the unborn
3498427 it was as if i could hear the echoes of all those people who with the most sympathetic of tones would say well except in cases of rape or who would rather fervently exclaim in disgust especially is cases of rape all these people are out there who dont even know me but are standing in judgment of my life so quick to dismiss it just because of how i was conceived i felt like i was now going to have to justify my own existence

3498429 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3498430 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3498431 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3498432 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3498433 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3498434 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3498435 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3498436 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3498437 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3498438 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3498439 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3498440 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3498441 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3498442 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3498443 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3498444 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3498445 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3498446 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3498447 this is a fantastic opportunity and i look forward to embracing laras world
3498448 its unbelievable how realistic her movements are in tomb raider underworld and its so gratifying to be able to use my years of gymnastic training to portray such a beloved character
3498449 no one has ever raised the issue of selling the property
3498450 it would seem to be overkill for a small piece of property
3498451 a strong finish to a very successful year revenue exceeded our previously announced guidance due to strong led sales we have executed our strategy to transform cree into a broad based led company with chips components and systems that are leading the led lighting revolution
3498452 everyone else that provides the same service or product as you do
3498453 they have intrusive recollections i keep remembering it i have nightmares about it i cant escape it
3498454 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3498455 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3498456 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3498457 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3498458 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3498459 john mccain does have a long history of working with these issues an extraordinary familiarity with the key participants and a historical understanding of how this conflict and crisis has come to be
3498460 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3498461 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3498462 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3498463 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3498464 most secret core and his sanctuary where he is alone with god whose voice echoes in his depths
3498465 if this is about people living their religious convictions then they should have enough faith not to choose work that conflicts with their convictions

3498468 a lot of the high profile investing of small money has been in consumer internet
3498469 but what i call low burn experimentation spans all technology i believe low burn experimentation is going to be a very disruptive force in business software and services
3498470 in that process i became interested in the gap in the venture business between angel investors on the one hand who typically dont invest more than 250 000 and vcs who typically dont invest less than 5 million
3498471 some of those companies started to do well and it was exciting and a lot of people suggested that i raise my own fund
3498472 in the early days of digg we asked how can we double our user base every four weeks without spending money on marketing egnyte and demandforce are asking the same questions today for business software and services
3498473 consumers are suffering from the high cost of the cell phones
3498474 if you want to sell the cell phone company the buyer will ask how many clients you have
3498475 they did this depress the number of subscribers because they were planning to sell the companies to their relatives at low prices
3498476 we had a meeting with the new minister the second day he entered his office
3498477 mr bassil is an excellent person he might have political reasons for what he does but hes not planning to collect any money from his decisions
3498478 whenever they talk about privatization you hear the protest of hizbullah and amal that the companies are a golden source of government revenue and that they should not be privatized
3498479 in jordan you have three completely independent companies competing and their charges are 30 percent of the charges in lebanon
3498480 i would first issue a third license and then invite bids for all three licenses
3498481 i would insist that they lower charges and make sure that they do not move toward an oligopoly i would eliminate the monthly fees
3498482 it all depends on how many telephone lines they build in the next 25 years
3498483 if the network is good enough the penetration level could easily go to 100 percent
3498484 this will ensure competition and that the rights of consumers are well protected
3498485 were getting ready to really increase the capacities of both networks to absorb more customers
3498486 the minister is intent on lowering prices he has said that the state of the consumer is his first priority i dont think it can be any more clear than that
3498487 judging by bassils public pronouncements over other issues it is not very encouraging that he has a meaningful one
3498488 dedicated low voltage sub processor and os that can enable multi day battery life
3498489 we are looking to train ngos in public consensus building on tough issues such as the management of conflict in divided communities
3498490 the participant ngos have real examples which they bring to the table
3498491 it can be disheartening for ngos in lebanon who are trying to diffuse tensions in the communities one politicians polarizing speech can destroy hard wrought efforts by ngos
3498492 we will surely introduce many of the concepts we are learning into our projects
3498493 there are always positive people amidst the doom and gloom
3498494 they are battle hardened but committed intelligent and ready to learn
3498495 about the rocket firing i think those who are responsible are those who collaborate with israel because there is a consensus by all palestinian groups to respect the truce
3498496 linked to israel as they provide a pretext to exercise pressure on the palestinian people
3498497 after the firing of a qassem type rocket toward israeli territory defense minister ehud barak has ordered the closure on tuesday of the crossings between israel and the gaza strip
3498498 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3498499 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3498500 i dont think russia will feel like talking with mr saakashvili after what he did to our citizens
3498501 were trying to get an assessment of exactly what it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3498502 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3498503 today the georgian ambassador to the netherlands filed a law suit to the international court of justice called the state of georgia against the state of russia because of ethnic cleansing conducted in georgia by russia in 1993 to 2008
3498504 people and their governments resistance and their demanding their rights will bear fruit
3498505 the iranian nation and government achieved all the progress they have despite pressures sanctions and threats by the domineering powers
3498506 the bomb went off just 10 minutes before diyala provincial governor raad rashid and i were intending to leave the headquarters
3498507 we have information that suicide bombers equipped with explosive belts arrived in baqouba to carry out attacks against security forces
3498508 we must capture or kill the hardcore terrorists that are residing now out in the hinterlands
3498509 he was sent to amman in the afternoon after experiencing heart problems
3498510 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive
3498511 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3498512 the present constitutional ordinance is to define the temporary powers of the state council
3498513 the necessary powers to reorganize and manage state affairs during the period needed for the organizing of presidential elections in the shortest possible time
3498514 raise the banner of jihad and let us bleed and have our limbs severed until we bring back a caliphate styled along the lines of the prophets way
3498515 wake up and prepare for the war the cross is marching toward you
3498516 wherever we find them we will arrest them and bring them to justice
3498517 those regimes that enslave their people have always raised the banner of democracy in their fight against islam while people see that most of them assumed power through military coups
3498518 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy occupied jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3498519 these are half truths used by israelis as a test balloon so they can blame the palestinian authority should the negotiations fail
3498520 we want a complete israeli withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 including occupied jerusalem and agreement on all the final status questions
3498521 negotiations with the palestinians are making progress on a number of subjects particularly borders
3498522 these negotiations are serious and are aimed at a common objective
3498523 we manufacture in lebanon and export to the other arab countries especially the gulf
3498524 the major business transactions take place in private so that the items dont lose their privacy that is how the most precious pieces are sold
3498525 i dont know why maybe its the political situation or maybe there is something better going on in europe
3498526 most of the manufacturing is here so you can find a much reduced price if they have a wedding they might come here to buy their jewelry
3498527 i came mainly for looking but if i find something i might buy it
3498528 this is just one quarter of what we have in qatar
3498529 syria wants a stable united and arab lebanon which does not serve as a trampoline for hostile activities
3498530 there will be coordination between the two countries embassies and the council
3498531 because he came here for this mission we can forgive him
3498532 i was a military career man i had been in the marine corps for 10 years before the war in iraq and yes i did volunteer
3498533 when we left to go there our commanders and leaders told us that we were going to help the iraqi people i believed in that message but when i discovered we were hurting more than we were helping i got out i left
3498534 we thank god that you came back safely from iraq
3498535 there is a reinforcement on the other side and its not by chance that we are training intensively on the golan heights and on a major scale
3498536 there has been a very significant reinforcement of hizbullah in recent years and we are examining the possibility that the balance of power has shifted with the introduction of sophisticated weapons from syria
3498537 this decision on wednesday by the security cabinet represents a change in israeli policy after always firmly separating hizbullah and the lebanese government
3498538 as responsible for any event that takes place in its sovereign territory or events for which lebanese nationals are responsible
3498539 regrouping of national forces around the priorities of the national reform agenda would provide the foundation for quick and increased progress by overcoming the many challenges of deep and structural reforms and by following due process
3498540 government priorities of reform action will be on debt and financial management competition and productivity privatization social protection and the broader issues of social development by accelerating reforms and modernization of the social insurance system rationalizing public sector health expenditures and education sector performance and quality enhancement
3498541 inflation is likely to stay above 5 percent given international developments with lackluster growth and continued fiscal tightness the external current account deficit relative to gdp should improve moderately
3498542 if the authorities financing strategy succeeds and donor support is in line with projections gross international reserves should increase by more than 1 billion during 2008 reflecting expected deposits from gulf countries at the banque du liban
3498543 so far the region has been somewhat isolated from the slowdown in major industrial countries but lebanon remains vulnerable to possible changes in regional liquidity and demand e g if oil prices were to drop sharply a worsening of the lebanese political and security situation could rattle confidence and trigger a slowdown or even a reversal of deposit inflows which would complicate the governments financing strategy and put pressure on reserves
3498544 one hundred mps have given their confidence to the cabinet five voted against and two abstained
3498545 i have never seen the constitution being torn apart the way it was in the past few years
3498546 despite some of the sharp criticisms expressed by some of the mps we are determined to turn over a new page in our relations
3498547 we all back sleimans visit and hope it would yield positive results
3498548 we accept this government because of necessity even though it is nothing more than a government of adversaries
3498549 this is tantamount to police oppression no one has the right to prevent legislators from expressing their views
3498550 i have never seen a state and an independent resistance on its side there should rather be a state with a defense strategy which builds on the capabilities and capacities of the resistance
3498551 the nine month term of this government does not enable it to fulfill all its promises
3498552 the tasks awaiting this government are many and the time we have is short we are hoping to gain strength from your precious confidence to accelerate steps together on the road to stability construction reforms and prosperity
3498553 we must all commit to the agreement that we reached in doha we must avoid accusing each other of treason
3498554 our security and armed forces will ensure the security of all lebanese citizens
3498555 overseeing next years elections is one of the governments main tasks but there are also other important issues which we need to take care of
3498556 the destroyer of the myth of the undefeatable israeli army
3498557 and for the first time the exhibition will include weapons used by the resistance while facing the israeli enemy
3498558 it will also display war material and ammunition in different artistic ways
3498559 destroyed image of the collapsed israeli army and the state of fear in which it is living
3498560 in addition the exhibition will present a panorama of the resistances two victories and its most important achievements and will be closed with an audio visual dramatic work that reflects the importance of martyrdom and sacrifice in the life of mughniyeh and his brothers
3498561 the cemetery of the invaders is the division displaying some of israels destroyed military vehicles and weapons that had been gathered by hizbullah during the july august 2006 war
3498562 the second section is called the time of victories it includes murals that highlight the victory and steadfastness of our people resistance and army
3498563 victory makers is a special section to honor mughniyeh the resistance and other martyrs where some of their personal belongings are displayed
3498564 and the exhibitions fourth division is a media center where documentaries that discuss the meaning of martyrdom and sacrifice are screened
3498565 when we estimated what unmacc would be able to achieve in 2008 we set a budget of 10 million
3498566 it is a matter of one or two weeks before we have to stop almost half
3498567 and some did donate which is why we are still here today
3498568 agriculture constitutes one of the main factors driving the economies of the people of the south
3498569 many of them have already lost out on two or three
3498570 it will be horrible to have to go and tell people that because we cannot continue our work they shouldnt use their uncleared land when you know that in fact they probably will
3498571 more than 320 people have been killed or injured since the end of the conflict mostly because of cluster munitions
3498572 israels extensive use of cluster bombs over such a small area coupled with high profile media coverage helped give momentum to non governmental organizations who had for years been trying to get cluster bombs banned
3498573 intended to systematically clear an additional 10 million square meters of cluster munitions contaminated land
3498574 so that by the end of the year the impact
3498575 effectively been neutralized to such an extent that a large donor funded clearance program is no longer required
3498576 with appropriate and dedicated funding the cluster munitions strike areas can be fully cleared by 2008
3498577 since july 15 reservations at hammanas hotels have exceeded 85 percent
3498578 our traditional laughter festival alone has received 10 000 people
3498579 the economic and commercial activity has flourished in a remarkable way and the movie house here has reopened
3498580 the choueifat town for example has recovered its tourist activity as emigrants returned to their hometown
3498581 hotels and beach resorts in neighboring khaldeh are also crowded with tourists
3498582 we no longer have any empty hotel rooms or apartments
3498583 the growth in this years tourist activity has caused many lebanese youths to refrain from traveling abroad and work in their homeland
3498584 residents of the gulf intend to spend ramadan in lebanon
3498585 unfortunately performance has not been acceptable to date unfortunately the responsibility rests both here in sudan and also with the united nations
3498586 but we have reasons to be encouraged and hopeful that the pace of the past will be reversed and we will see substantially more unamid peacekeepers here to help the people of darfur in the near future
3498587 well be very disappointed if the pace doesnt pick up substantially weve had specific plans shared with us both in new york and in darfur at unamid headquarters for that to take place
3498588 i think the developments in 2008 from a variety of sources have brought a new focus and attention and the united states is anxious to be supportive of progress where possible
3498589 but let me emphasize and this is terribly important if were going to get a sustainable peace in darfur in the end the sovereign state of sudan will have to address this issue
3498590 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
3498591 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3498592 we did see that there was potential for a conflagration in the region but georgia is a friendly state its supported by the us and so it was difficult to refuse
3498593 the only guarantee mea provides to the financers is the productivity of the airline itself
3498594 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3498595 it is a reaction to bajaur and other operations and if these are not stopped then we will launch more attacks this is the first attack and if the operation is not stopped more attacks will be carried out you cannot imagine what atrocities the government is committing against innocent women and children
3498596 the flawed internal and external policies of his dictatorial regime have resulted in the large scale murder of innocent people of our province and fata federally administered tribal areas
3498597 pakistans drift into extremism allah the army and americas war on terror
3498598 negotiating arab israeli peace american leadership in the middle east
3498599 an alarming pattern of mismanaged diplomacy both strategic and tactical us involvement has been characterized by fits and starts errors of omission and commission and fundamental weaknesses in policy formulation and execution rhetoric all too often has replaced action opportunities were squandered potential breakthroughs missed and meaningful advances stalled unnecessarily
3498600 israel plays an outsized role in us politics and diplomacy
3498601 restore the us role to its historical purpose of helping the parties to achieve their core requirements
3498602 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the safety of our peacekeeping forces and civilian population has been restored the aggressor has been punished having sustained considerable losses its armed forces have been disorganised
3498603 should centres of resistance or other aggressive attempts arise you must take the decision to destroy them
3498604 you know the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery
3498605 russia wanted to manoeuvre saakashvili into a situation where he would be seen to be making the first move and then provide a pretext for russian action

3498609 hey put your money at risk and well make it worth your while because we think its good for america
3498610 its a bit more complex than we had thought it was
3498611 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3498612 drug development is the next stage and now we know exactly where out of a great many calls that we need to be aiming these therapies to get the best chance of attacking and killing the cancer
3498613 its basic science but its a very important step forward against a very difficult disease
3498614 but in order to develop them we needed this deeper understanding of their molecular and cellular origins
3498615 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3498616 but in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once
3498617 the 3g coverage of t mobile is as good as the competition there can therefore not lie we suspect that it is a hardware software specific issue of the iphone itself
3498618 we therefore recommend to the software updates from apple in the eye this you get through itunes
3498619 we advise customers to keep an eye on apples software updates

3498631 we think the death penalty deters absolutely nobody from committing a crime the option of life in prison needs to be studied if it is not something that is not an infringement we could accept it
3498632 crime and violence continue to be rampant with 14 year olds murdering their peers
3498633 the death penalty is punishment upon punishment that is we would be falling into vengeance and when will it end if you kill a criminal there will be a sense of hatred and vengeance and it will be a circle that never ends
3498634 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good

3498643 the problem in sacramento is that there are some who want to engage in the pork barrel politics of asking for even more money than has been distributed for their pet projects
3498644 on the westside there are four times as many jobs than there are homes and people
3498645 today daniel squadron shows that he stands with the senate republicans and their major financiers in their efforts to maintain the status quo in albany it is clear that mr squadron cant be trusted to support the soon to be senate democratic majority like the true progressive in the race senator martin connor will democratic voters in lower manhattan and brooklyn should support senator connor in his efforts to bring reform to the legislative process as part of the emerging democratic majority in the new york state senate

3498653 so i dont know if its about the money either
3498654 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it

3498701 what caught my eye was that the information being used by the immune system was a negative kind of information
3498702 i would like to think these numbers are smaller than women think they are
3498703 remain terrified they are going to relapse i think the message for women is the risk may not be as large as they think
3498704 women who had er positive cancer were more likely to have late recurrences than those with er negative
3498705 estrogen receptor status is a tumor marker we look at
3498706 we know that those who have er positive tumors have cancers that are responsive to the effects of estrogen
3498707 the major message is that even though women may have gone through five years of hormonal therapy they are still at risk of relapse
3498708 basically the jury is out on the potential value of additional treatment strategies once the five years is completed
3498709 based on this study we need to be open to question whether other treatment programs may be appropriate in some of these women after the five year period is completed

3498731 ive taken the role this year of having barbosa in the car and let him completely do the setup
3498732 me and hurley haywood were fighting back and forth over the setup of the car last year what worked for me didnt necessarily work for him but what barbosa sets up generally works for me and im usually able to work up a few positions in every race then he gets in and just goes joaos getting comfortable in the car now hes getting it set up how he likes it and hes been absolutely flying at the finish but we just keep having little mistakes and penalties
3498733 the best thing i can do to get us a good position is not battling with people and beating the car up the car needs to have all the aero tidbits on it and all four wheels pointing in the same direction
3498734 i made a bad call at the glen starting on rain tires
3498735 i felt horrible not giving him the car in better position he should he up there fighting for the win not fighting to get laps back
3498736 he seems to pick stuff up pretty quick so im not worried about that
3498737 we also can share stuff with the no 58 team so we should be pretty good
3498738 its the first time ive ever led it and im pretty excited i was expected to be a little behind mark patterson still
3498739 he mccain has always felt that sound science is a foundation of good public policy

3498743 obama believes that upon being elected president of the united states he could sign an executive order that would overturn the bush position on stem cell research and open up the avenues considerably
3498744 hope is that we may reach the day when we no longer need to use embryonic stem cells as the foundation of this particular line of research where we can move to the more recent advances and take away the tough decisions about life versus science
3498745 senator obama believes that we have to double scientific research funding so that we can take advantage of the enormous talent in the united states and we can regain our global competitive edge
3498746 its clean its smooth but it doesnt reflect a balancing of political priorities there will be competing demands for funds these are scarce taxpayer dollars they come from american families who work hard to generate them and good scientists should make the case for their research money and the senator will be happy to listen to that case and fund appropriately but to promise everybody everything is not really laying it on the line
3498747 we recognize science as being a tool to help solve many of the problems before us
3498748 i think thats a different perspective and putting your money where your mouth is

3498750 my father provided me with a lot of business principles a small town retail business ethic and i guess i learned it its sort of ironic because i swore when i was a kid id never do what he did at eighteen we had this big break when he wanted me to go into the business and i refused and i told him there are two things i know for sure one is that i will end up doing something with cars whether im a racer a mechanic or whatever and two that i will never be president of a company i guess i got outwitted

3498755 mental health and psychosocial interventions for children and adolescents globally have received little research attention even though mental health problems are one of the most significant contributors to the global burden of disease
3498756 little is known about the efficacy of mental health interventions for children exposed to armed conflicts in low and middle income settings childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability
3498757 no changes were found on the other outcome variables traumatic idioms depressive anxiety symptoms and functioning the latter for boys
3498758 we hypothesize that these results may show that psychosocial interventions alone are unable to reverse the challenges to psychosocial well being presented by chronic poverty and political instability
3498759 in short a school based psychosocial intervention was able to moderately reduce ptsd symptoms retain hope and improve functioning for girls and retain hope for boys affected by communal violence in a low income context
3498760 further adaptations and research to address the full range of post traumatic outcomes and functioning are necessary

3498837 a vision hangs there right behind my eyes i want to keep it and make it real finally realize that what is hidden is often better shared being that some burdens are better compared in the open than at the backs of our minds left there to fester all of our frailties built high to hide behind taking up my pen and laying down the pages that could make me whole i scratch and smudge an image only to deride it isnt quite correct so i rub and make a mess with an eraser standing by comfortably numb that this could take some time to get the composition right i close my eyes and wander dreaming but awake around the places these things are kept searching the details most would soon forget and i struggle with the decision to say i am finished and call it quits a conclusion that sight unseen is no longer illusion but captured and made flawed and perfect this is only a momentary relief for that desire comes calling more often than i can keep up a passion for fulfilling and understanding this waking world a constant filling of a wine in my never ending cup to drink from until intoxication of my own creative will i record a history write a masterpiece allow those who would question an ounce of my sanity to look deep within those places they long to be and i burden them now with the truths i have come to see and they too can come to believe a dream unfulfilled is a terrible living tragedy and again i will put pen to paper answering the questions they have and those that follow these with questions of my own about beauty time and art making sense of what is real by taking the barriers of life apart this and this alone is why i am here and playing my part

3498852 we still have a very good team out tomorrow and hopefully we can get the result we want
3498853 if you are a good football player you are a good football player whether its in the champions league or in another game
3498854 the level of focus within the side is very high and everyone will want to do well tomorrow
3498855 we always have a very young midfield and a very young team at the moment but that does not mean we do not have experience
3498856 they are a team who have knocked out ajax in the qualifiers of the champions league that deserves respect
3498857 we know they have a typical dutch culture of playing football and keeping the ball very well and therefore we need a good defensive concentration
3498858 in england we have always to calm things down because after one month of games there is always the media pressure to make quick stars
3498859 players are young and patient development does not mean you cannot start early but it is most important to keep developing as a player and that you dont have to worry about too much pressure on your shoulders
3498860 i believe most of these players will be out for a very short time
3498861 nasri should be available for saturday philippe senderos kolo could also be available and we believe fabregas will only miss two games so overall we should get many players back very quickly

3498865 to know what is right and not do it is the worst cowardice
3498866 look at an infantrymans eyes and you can tell how much he has seen
3498867 when there is no peril in the fight there is no glory in the triumph
3498868 its one of my favorite teams in the american league
3498869 we played six games against them and they have a very good team good pitching their defense is good young and im looking at the scoreboard often to see if they win
3498870 these guys have been able to overcome the exit of two great ballplayers theres no other way to explain our success
3498871 these guys are special starting with hanley ramirez and dan uggla they never give up and were improving our pitching with young arms
3498872 i think that for us getting these three guys volstad johnson and sanchez is equal to making a big trade like the one made by milwaukee for cc sabathia
3498873 if johnson and sanchez pitch like in 2006 well be in the hunt until the final out of the season
3498874 young pitchers rarely dominate the strike zone they have the stuff but as one would expect theyre still learning how to use both sides of the plate johnson has more velocity ricky nolasco has a great curve and sanchez has movement in all his pitches volstad has movement and strength and scott olsen is a competitor
3498875 johnson is pitching as if he was never hurt and anibal looks good
3498876 theres no ace here we have a very special group of young pitchers that give us a chance to win every day we dont have as much experience as the other teams in contention but we have nothing to lose if we dont win at least well get the experience for the future
3498877 i felt pretty good against atlanta a 4 0 loss on july 21 a couple of base hits you know ground balls through the hole kind of got me i felt good its just things havent gone my way so far
3498878 in the pitching staff were all young so we all get along really well
3498879 this month and next month are big our pitching staff is definitely a key well put up runs almost every night our offense is big
3498880 our hitting was our strength at the beginning of the season but if were going to stay in contention well need to have good starting pitching
3498881 we needed a bat like mannys but we couldnt pull it off thats all in the past and we need to focus on whats ahead this game is a business and we want to leave all that noise behind us
3498882 pinto has been the key for us to be in this position and acquiring a veteran like rhodes is a big plus
3498883 theyre inexperienced and they are coming off injuries there will be situations like what we have here in miami with the rain where if one of those guys johnson or sanchez is pitching and it rains its hard to get them back in the ballgame
3498884 i have to take it easy with them because we dont want them to get hurt again

3498973 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3498974 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3498975 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3498976 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
3498977 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3498978 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3498979 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3498980 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3498981 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3498982 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
3498983 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3498984 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3498985 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3498986 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3498987 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3498988 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3498989 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3498990 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3498991 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3498992 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3498993 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3498994 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3498995 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3498996 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3498997 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3498998 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3498999 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3499012 considering the free and accessible nature of religious education offered by churches i believe it is not necessary to be taught in the public schools
3499013 i believe public schools should teach the pledge of allegiance to students as soon as they begin school in kindergarten and students should participate in reciting the pledge at an early age

3499075 the song isnt necessarily about her but its about that scene about being stuck in that dragging yourself down and having those people around you that can drag you down it was kind of a personal reflection on people in this band that were letting that happen nobodys a saint and everybodys had their issues some people can rise above some cant its a reflection of getting yourself stuck in that hole with those enablers around you so you either go out or you dont
3499076 absolutely everything was intentional originally there were more birds but we wanted five to represent the band having the sparse white the label atlantic records kept coming back saying people will refer to it as your white album in reference to the beatles self titled release from 1968 is that so bad id love to have the white album or the black album referring to metallicas self titled cd from 1991 fine great that wasnt the intention we just wanted that sparseness we thought it was striking and that it would stand out not only on the store shelf but to us as well
3499077 yeah we thought they were a little too busy and a little too metaphoric i think we went over the top and got lost in the jumble its a little much for this one we went with the polar opposite and the cool thing about having that cut out is all the different circles where the lyrics are you can turn that around and create your own album cover thats kind of the premise behind it
3499078 it is what it is it fit 110 because madness is what weve gone through and madness is what the songs are its not just good or bad madness isnt necessarily a negative term madness can be in the morning when your alarm goes off madness can be youre out of coffee or your childs screaming its your own personal thing sick as a dog and youve got to overcome any of that its just what came out of us we had a bunch of album titles and i cant remember any of them because the sound of madness was the perfect choice
3499079 junkies for fame was a fan favourite that was one of the first songs written for the record we did a small tour before going into the studio on that tour we were trying out some of the new songs the ones we had were the crow amp the butterfly junkies for fame and devour they were still in the rough form but we were trying them out on the road and the crowds really loved junkies for fame when it came time to do the album we recorded it but it didnt fit the feel of the record necessarily we still wanted to do something with it and rock band was interested in us when they heard devour but they wanted an exclusive song so what better way to give that to our fans not only is it out there they can also play along with it eventually it will be released as a digital download
3499080 it was a vibe thing it was take your time get it right and well get it done when we first approached atlantic about doing this record they asked if we could do it in six months and we said no we cant they asked how much time we needed and we said we dont know they gave us whatever we needed it took 18 months writing and recording really the recording process was about five or six months and it was worth it we put everything under the microscope and im happy with all of it

3499105 today we are using a lot of new materials that we werent using thirty or forty years back a lot of new kinds of plastics new kinds of chemicals new kinds of products are coming into place were using so many kinds of plastic packaging and people are also using more packaged food all this is creating a kind of waste which is very toxic and we have no mechanism to deal with it exposure to these toxics have various kinds of long term chronic effects which includes cancer endocrine disruption that means your hormone system gets disrupted if youre a growing child then you dont grow properly you have reproductive failures later in life also you have genetic issues now we are finding that some of these chemicals can have impacts at the gene level
3499106 also some tests have been done on what they call body burdens and we find that each of our bodies is a repository for thousands of chemicals which were not there earlier our ancestors did not have these chemicals in their bodies so weve become like a toxic landfill in a sense the repository of all the chemicals in the world and the fear is that it not only impacts our lives but it impacts our childrens lives and their childrens lives
3499107 when you dispose of waste in a landfill some of the toxics can leach into the groundwater and the groundwater is not only below the landfill it goes across boundaries of the landfill or the gases which come from the waste especially if you burn it can be very very dangerous creating something like dioxin which is called the most toxic compound made by man its an endocrine disruptor its cancer causing and can have intergenerational effects as well also open burning of waste is a significant cause of emissions of carbon which causes global warming
3499108 when we start consuming for the sake of consumption there is no end to it and i think it is that kind of consumption that we have to put a stop to
3499109 are we just taking nature for granted we cannot act irresponsibly on the planet we are born on living as part of the nature we are born in i think that realisation is very important
3499110 we need to be active in society we have to ask for more we cant just be passive consumers because if youre passive consumers you get the worst

3499114 the board and i intend to conduct an exhaustive search for a chief financial officer we are uncertain of the duration of the search at this time darin s sudden and unforeseen resignation in no way impacts our ability to continue to deliver on our stated goals business strategy and accounting and financial reporting capabilities we are fortunate to have alfredo step in once again during our search for a replacement to ensure a smooth transition with our recently improved capabilities in our accounting treasury and financial reporting personnel including among others two newly created vice president controller positions for midstream corporate and upstream minerals respectively a vice president of risk and compliance and a strong vice president of financial reporting i am confident that alfredo will also be able to remain very much focused and active in our acquisition growth strategy during this interim period

3499145 if he chooses dhoni then bindra can be assured of long term endorsement deals
3499146 abhinav bindra as a brand ambassador has iconic status with his achievements he has rewritten history which is unique

3499149 anirban blah ceo globosport a firm that handles brand endorsements for several sportspersons shares thomas reservation

3499160 consumers in nearly every income group are being more cost conscious
3499161 junes retail sales not including gasoline were down from last year further in deloittes recent back to school survey a hefty 90 percent of consumers said they were changing the way they shop or cutting back due to economic concerns with value being the operative word right now retailers may benefit by emphasizing value offerings and focusing on well timed promotions

3499251 as i write russia is waging war on my country on friday hundreds of russian tanks crossed into georgian territory and russian air force jets bombed georgian airports bases ports and public markets many are dead many more wounded this invasion which echoes afghanistan in 1979 and the prague spring of 1968 threatens to undermine the stability of the international security system why this war this is the question my people are asking this war is not of georgias making nor is it georgias choice the kremlin designed this war earlier this year russia tried to provoke georgia by effectively annexing another of our separatist territories abkhazia when we responded with restraint moscow brought the fight to south ossetia ostensibly this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia and above all it is a war over the kind of europe our children will live in let us be frank this conflict is about the future of freedom in europe no country of the former soviet union has made more progress toward consolidating democracy eradicating corruption and building an independent foreign policy than georgia this is precisely what russia seeks to crush this conflict is therefore about our common trans atlantic values of liberty and democracy it is about the right of small nations to live freely and determine their own future it is about the great power struggles for influence of the 20th century versus the path of integration and unity defined by the european union of the 21st georgia has made its choice

3499287 pilots like it because they can see the improvements that the massachusetts port authority massport has implemented over the years from better runway signage markings and new runway status lights to more taxiways every project makes a difference
3499288 boston has even delivered several initiatives like the enhanced runway marking and signage project ahead of schedule and gone above and beyond the faa regulations to make its airport safer
3499289 its clear that their management and workers place a high premium on collaboration with all industry representatives to get the job done
3499290 boston logan is deeply honored to receive this award said edward c

3499292 this notion that everyone gets a cost of living adjustment is no longer true
3499293 theyve had to pay for higher air conditioning costs higher heating oil and gas costs
3499294 the medicare premium alone has doubled since 2000 and is almost 100 per month
3499295 the social security cola over that time period has only gone up 25 percent so the health care costs are eating more and more

3499325 the funding choices made were inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases or the money was going to fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
3499326 i guess more than anything its a little bit annoying that weve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
3499327 i think our funding comes in at something less than 0 1 per cent of the whole program
3499328 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad

3499333 i think our bigger fear was that we didnt want to offend any religious people but looking at the discussion that unfolded from this thing what we had was a good sizeable group of players that we might call militant atheists and the rest of the players seemed very tolerant including all of the religious players
3499334 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side
3499335 but so far ive had no critical feedback at all from anybody who is religious feeling that we were misrepresenting religion or it was bad to represent religion in the game it was really the atheists
3499336 open to the idea that there is some creator somewhere
3499337 can almost envision humans one day being able to create a micro universe thats not to say we could ever interact with it but it could be that the physics equations for a singularity are the same as for the big bang which is that black holes in our universe could in fact be embedded universes that we will never be able to contact or get information from
3499338 we didnt want to go too far down that path we leave the whole creation of the universe question open
3499339 obviously as the player youre coming in and playing something like a god directing the evolution of a species but we never really state who you the player are
3499340 we had a series of the story lines and things that we wanted to do i had sort of assumed at the end of season 8 that that would be about it but we were around season 6 so were going to be talking i think during the season about the condition of the health care system because it will be our last time to really comment on it

3499342 um no dave fortman really helped me appreciate rick rubin as a producer sometimes hindsight is 20 20 sometimes it takes another situation to kind of make you look back at a different situation and really see how good you had it you know rick rubin was able to do things that dave fortman could never do im not trying to take anything away from dave fortman as a producer hes extremely talented he wasnt able to get nine people together on the same page and to me thats the most important thing in making a slipknot record i guess if you have nothing nice to say dont say anything at all

3499348 we need a game plan for bringing parking technology into the 21st century in all five boroughs
3499349 muni meters and pay by phone systems increase parking availability and allow drivers to pay by credit cards so that people dont have to keep their piggy banks in their glove compartments
3499350 muni meters provide for more parking spaces than do parking meters
3499351 as everyone knows parking spaces are in demand i am also enthusiastic about this bill because it provides for an additional innovative way to purchase a muni meter ticket use your cell phone as payment system congratulations to council member felder

3499363 the company has announced proposals to re organise distribution management administration and telephone sales activities at academy park in glasgow and to cease publishing the glasgow east news and the ayrshire extra

3499365 i think we need to think beyond the square by having an institution that facilitates that sort of cooperation across the policy spaces rather than one specifically constrained to economic mandate
3499366 in developing this discussion lets be clear what an asia pacific community is not
3499367 it is not an economic union it is not a monetary union it is not at this stage even a customs union it is a concept and it is certainly not a political union
3499368 the governor absolutely must deliver the resources needed to make this mandate succeed
3499369 we really need the money now we need this plan now
3499370 did you do that thing i told you to do
3499371 what thing youve told me a lot of things to do
3499372 most single cabinet surround systems typically require reflective walls to optimize a sonic image but with slimstage weve effectively removed this barrier by incorporating patented surround and speaker technologies that dont rely on walls or subwoofers to produce a pinpoint surround sound image and our patented technologies have allowed us to develop a super slim cabinet which unlike others has bass and nearly disappears on furniture or under a flat panel tv
3499373 have you ever been through a genocide hiding in a closet with the devil on the other side
3499374 the waves were definitely the biggest ive ever seen in south africa and possibly the biggest anywhere
3499375 greg towed me into one giant wave that was so big i was terrified and started hyper ventilating
3499376 later when we saw the photos taken by craig kolesky with a large lens from chapmans peak we realized that those were possibly the biggest waves ever recorded on a par with the rides we had a cortes bank in january which were measured at well over 70 feet

3499379 the answer to your question is it depends on who is asking the question
3499380 based on the foregoing this court declares that section 3 2 fails to include charter commission members
3499381 w e did not want people who were already elected to other positions in our local government serving on the charter commission
3499382 this lone memory fails to find support in the published preexisting documentary evidence on the 1989 charter commissions deliberations and recommendations
3499383 a charter commission s external and independent authority categorically differentiates it from a towns office
3499384 the separate form and nature of a charter commission from a town office precludes subsuming charter commission within the term town office

3499440 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3499441 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3499442 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3499516 its exactly like hungary 1956 its exactly like czechoslovakia 1968 it is like afghanistan invasion it is like nazi germany invasion of czechoslovakia and poland so this is the full scale russian military intervention military aggression on its neighbor
3499517 the full scale military aggression against the country is aimed to destroy country and to overthrow the government of this democratic country on its knees
3499518 the russian aggression continues as we speak and their air force is still bombing civilian and military targets and people are still dying and we think this madness should be stopped
3499519 look into a crystal ball and know what russia was trying to do

3499535 were starting with them but we want to find mushrooms which naturally like oil if we could develop a strain of mushroom whose particular ecological niche was oil pollution and nothing else that would be our dream
3499536 you cant just put the mushrooms in the oil and expect a miracle
3499537 you need to feed them too we find sawdust is very good and also human hair
3499538 we had a hair delivery this morning and we have high hopes for it its very absorbent and the mushrooms love it were also doing trials with sugar cane husk coconut shell and banana leaves
3499539 mushrooms secrete enzymes to digest food outside their bodies and then absorb the nutrients that the digestion process releases
3499540 the same enzyme mushrooms use to digest lignin a main component of wood is used to digest petroleum
3499541 were afraid people will think this is a miracle solution which it isnt
3499542 we cant do anything about the oil pits in their raw state nothing in nature can deal with that but what we can do is make the soil resuseable after the bulk has been removed then people could regenerate their own patch
3499543 this would be an amazing thing for the people here to be able to remediate their own land
3499544 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3499545 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere

3499548 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3499549 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3499550 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3499551 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students

3499623 we expect that this legislation including the tax credit provided to small business owners who pay 60 percent of their employees premiums and to those entrepreneurs who are self employed will help bolster the small business engine that is an integral part of the united states economy

3499635 but why should anybody care i mean i wish if more people use linux but deep inside i dont car that much
3499636 uh what are you and idiot heres why youre wrong

3499644 how do you admin a network like active directory but for all linux servers and workstations
3499645 one of the main reasons that most people are afraid to try linux is because they have this preconceived notion about linux
3499646 for all of the idiots out there claiming linux is too difficult to install go grab a ubuntu cd and a windows cd
3499647 try each one see wich one has more hardware support
3499648 if your manufacturer tailored a linux distribution the same way your hardware support issues would be eliminated all the same

3499651 but not like rene van der gijp who does motivational speeches for big rooms full of people i couldnt do that im too shy for that
3499652 yeah i played central defender in those days i was tall and strong i didnt mind physical challenges and was a good header and i was slow so they couldnt use me anywhere else i guess
3499653 but still ajax also needs lower teams i guess to compete in different competitions i dont think i was destined for the big job in those days but things changed when my youth coach suddenly put me in as central striker i started to score goals a lot and that changed everything
3499654 i was never really highly talented like van basten or vanenburg but i was pretty aloof and strong and tall i knew how to hold my own and to be honest scoring in an ajax team is always easier than in say sparta or telstar i always played with good players that helps
3499655 ruud geels and ray clarke had just left ajax and tonnie blanker was the chosen one for the striker position but he didnt make it so ajax signed piet hamberg he was a bit injured when he came so leo used me as striker in the season warm up i scored and kept scoring and since then i stayed in the team i was only 17 years old i do remember i made my debut in the season before against sparta but i cant remember a single thing from that match only that i was extremely nervous ajax won 4 3
3499656 i played with jesper olsen on the left of me and tcheu la ling on the right a strikers dream with these two scoring was easy i was a huge ling fan man that guy was insanely good what an elegance and style mostly brilliant sometimes horrible he could do what i couldnt even do in my dreams and a very nice guy too
3499657 we trained constantly on those crosses at the near post until you got sick of it but it worked nine out of ten times i only had to tap the ball in i remember the older players like arnesen and lerby and piet schrijvers would yell at me for everything i did wrong i remember thinking i couldnt do anything right it must have worked but i do feel they could have done it in a nicer way it was a tough learning process
3499658 i knew him from his feyenoord days but never realized how good he was man he was smart he was a good coach too tough but friendly and johan cruyff came back in the winter break and when he came everything clicked we were unstoppable with arnesen lerby olsen cruyff and jansen it was easy for me i couldnt fail and then we had some talents coming up like vanenburg and rijkaard kurt linder was our coach but he only nagged johan determined everything already in those days
3499659 the expectations after my first season were huge i was only 19 years old and had made my debut in oranje as well the pressure was immense and i started to cramp up and choke marco was pushed as my successor although we also played together we could play well together but the club wanted me to move on johnny bosman was also explicitly knocking on the door and ton harmsen the club chairman i loathed pushed me out
3499660 italy wasnt as open as it is today and pisa really wanted me i could make a lot of money there and my manager really pushed that move only krol jan peters and michel van der korput played in italy and somehow i wanted to play there too the city was totally crazy when the club presented me i looked behind me at the airport because i thought maradona had arrived they thought i was a world class player which i wasnt i was a dependent player if you know what i mean
3499661 it was horrible i was only 20 years old and i needed good players to allow me to do my job but i was most of the times the only lone striker and wed be in training camps for weeks my girl friend hated life in italy we also hardly ever got paid in time
3499662 in the serie b pisa dared to play offensive and i scored a lot i became a popular player in pisa we promoted directly again and the next season in the serie a was a relative success
3499663 i still had a three year deal with torino and i loved that club but life in holland was better for my young family kiefts son robin was born in torino so i moved back
3499664 we started well and we never stopped we had a great team i became the dutch top scorer again with 29 goals and i secured my spot in the dutch team
3499665 sure at the time it was frustrating to be honest you dont look at the team you only focus on yourself i wanted to play period later on i learned to accept that marco was the better player much better i can see that but i didnt want to give up that spot without a fight whenever i came on i gave it my all
3499666 that 1988 tournament was just great wonderful experience we were a real team very hungry and eager i was also part of the wc1990 squad and the ec1992 squad but the chemistry wasnt there those teams were teams of spoiled stars who would win the title with one finger in the nose in sweden 1992 it seemed as if we were on a holiday together i cant even remember a thing from that tournament the best players dont always win the title you know you need more by the way i though the 1998 squad was the better team compared to 1988
3499667 i liked romario he was a good seed he liked me too because id pass the ball to him whenever he was in the better position i didnt care who scored him or me but some other players didnt like him and tried to ignore him i even scored 21 goals that season so i wasnt too unhappy overall
3499668 i had some issues with certain players at psv some thought they were the big stars suddenly the vibe wasnt good bordeaux really wanted to sign me so i thought why not but after a couple of months the general manager ended up in prison for fraud and the club was practically bankrupt we didnt get our pay and i took the used jerseys home to wash them for the next week insane psv asked me back when the issues there were resolved so i went back to eindhoven
3499669 a wonderful man i really clicked with him a sweet man and a great coach uncomplicated but smart in a motivational sense youd break through a brick wall for him
3499670 two months later oranje played another friendly and i was surprised to get an invite as normal
3499671 aad de mos was psvs coach and i thought he was a bit of a fake his motivational and interpersonal stuff was just not truthful you know he acted more than he was himself i hated that so when my body didnt cooperate and things at psv were a bit iffy i decided to throw the towel feyenoord and ajax wanted to sign me as pinch hitter which i thought was quite something but it was over and done with my body and mind didnt want to go on anymore i quit my last game was volendam away a pathetic end really
3499672 i dont see marco van basten as my rival or my enemy or something if he wasnt there would i have had a better career i dont know maybe i would have played longer at ajax but then again my italy period was wonderful i learned a lot there and i was successful at psv
3499673 well i will continue with that but i will also enlist in the trainer coach studies next season i will do my apprentice ship at the oranje under 19 year olds

3499711 to enter forcefully as an enemy go into with hostile intent
3499712 reinforces the conviction that a lot of americans have that the news media arent on the level that theyre biased

3499714 i know and love michael and im tempted to say something completely unsubstantiated about his personal life right now and see if he can disprove it

3499716 well sure sure you do but the point about this is that rielle hunter the principal involved had said to a number people that edwards was father of her baby i mean look this whole thing is seemly unseemly its unpleasant

3499720 the good thing is that if office 2007 applications are affected theyre less affected because the file format changed with that version
3499721 because the file formats the older formats in particular have been so well documented outside of microsoft
3499722 its not unusual to have a few and by a few i think of one or two maybe three but were looking at a full deck here
3499723 it tells me that one of the best ways to find new vulnerabilities continues to be to look at what microsoft has patched in the past and what they might have missed when they did
3499724 absolutely this works you look in the same area of code as the fix microsoft applied maybe the function call they patched here is being used somewhere else

3499741 wat we tot nu toe gehoord hebben bevalt ons wel maar er ligt zeker nog geen akkoord op tafel het zal nu wachten zijn op een concreet voorstel van de bemiddelaar om te zien of een oplossing mogelijk is

3499750 bayhs support of authorizing force in iraq stands in sharp contrast to mr obamas oft stated view that he showed the good judgment to oppose the conflict from the start after his vote mr bayh in early 2003 joined mr mccain as an honorary co chairman of the committee for the liberation of iraq which made regime change in iraq its central cause
3499751 british and american aggression in iraq was condemned throughout the world it didnt stop them doing it though the sheer humbug and hypocrisy of those who went along with that earlier evil act yet now condemn russia is simply nauseating

3499767 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
3499768 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
3499769 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
3499770 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election

3499772 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal

3499794 he was escorted by five security guards off the property it was rough
3499795 why do you think they are continuing the vaccuous celebrity meme it actually garnered mccain more hits than obama it gets views so you do what works
3499796 being here for three years and playing hard it was kind of crazy to see a team like new england who everybody views as the gurus of scouting who do such a great job of bringing in late round picks and free agents and turning them into superstars so when they came calling it was a tremendous honor even though things didnt work out
3499797 one thing i did leave there knowing was that they were very interested in me and thought very highly of me
3499798 i was trying to keep things in perspective but its weird playing special teams here for three years and being told indirectly thats your role on this team and then having a team say hey weve seen your preseason film of you starting
3499799 it was great to have the interest any team in general especially the patriots it just seems that every year they do something some way to win games
3499800 coming into the draft 3 4 teams were what my agent and me were looking toward
3499801 most of our linebackers are 230 pounds and im 250 255 pounds
3499802 but 3 4 4 3 i think i fit well in both schemes but being a bigger linebacker i feel like i have more value in a 3 4 because you cant just plug in a smaller linebacker
3499803 they brought me in they gave me a chance they fixed my foot
3499804 we kind of joked about that prior to the draft we have 11 linebackers and theyll probably draft a linebacker in the first three rounds and sure enough they did
3499805 you cant fault the panthers for that hes a great value pick and hes a great linebacker too any time you get a guy like that in the third round id have done the same thing
3499806 i am open to offers and i think that a farmer wants a wife is interesting and some of those people have met their ideal matches and i think thats wonderful

3499816 all of these activities would clearly constitute the activities of a private investigator under the private detective licensing act and as such media sentry would be required to have a private investigator license to engage in such activities within the state
3499817 all of these investigative actions by mediasentry however were illegal because mediasentry is not and never has been properly licensed as an investigative agency within the state of michigan

3499829 for the second consecutive quarter loan officers cited an uncertain economic outlook and worries about industry specific problems as the primary reasons for a record pace of tightening standards on commercial and industrial loans
3499830 banks tightened commercial real estate and various consumer loans at record levels as well

3499867 this is the best league in the world and last year villa did very well they play very good football and had a fantastic season
3499868 so i am very happy to come here with the opportunity to play in the premier league we are also playing in europe this season so that will be good
3499869 i watched villa last season and martin oneill is a very good coach he plays exciting attacking football and i am excited to be here
3499870 my ambition is to play for my country and i think with aston villa i will have that possibility every player wants to play international football and that is my aim
3499871 we know that were in a period of transition with the end of a generation

3499876 apart from being a logistical nightmare the main concern among many is how all these planned major overhauls of the building would impact on the substantive work of the world body particularly its reform agenda and the millennium development goals mdgs
3499877 with the anticipated considerable disruption of even the normal work of the staff who would be housed in various swing spaces the much needed headquarters leadership would be seriously constrained as the mdgs target year of 2015 gets close
3499878 can you imagine how an organization with more than 4 000 staffers spread all over the city would be able to handle effectively even partially its high profile responsibility to achieve these goals
3499879 i dont know the details of the renovation and how it will be phased but i have the impression that it will be a big headache for everyone including of course ngos
3499880 this is primarily not because of bad planning by the united nations as i understand it but because there is a huge amount of construction work to be done work that has been put off for a very long time
3499881 the project met a level of consideration for blasts that would make the building very safe
3499882 it is good that the actual work for that has commenced now i hope the so called capital master plan can keep its time frame for completion of the work within the next five years
3499883 but unfortunately that rejection happened when the united nations was reeling from the oil for food scandal in iraq and while the u n s relations with the new york state legislators were at the lowest
3499884 well may be the critics would say that the disruption of the u n s work would not be noticed at all given the minimalist agenda it is now pursuing
3499885 they will make their way in the confusion they will find the u n missions still open for business in the same place the receptions will not be any less the secretariat staff will be found for interaction in some new and temporary niche in the neighborhood and life will go on
3499886 lets hope there will be a slightly new tilt in washington that will mean a bit more space for international cooperation and multilateral discourse
