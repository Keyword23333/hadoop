940086 so i was already beginning to move toward environmental activism
940087 and then i saw an inconvenient truth at the music hall
940088 as my husband and i walked home we said we knew we had to change our lives
940089 i could not believe id been intellectualizing the problem for so long i knew i had to do something
940090 because in 20 years our house could be under water but i said we have to stay and work here for me i knew right away it was going to take the form of activism
940091 this was an important step for me on my environmental journey

940101 the vaccination campaign so far has been a phenomonal success with we believe more than 85 of stock in the protection zone vaccinated against the disease this is an unprecendented level of vaccination particularly bearing in mind it was a voluntary campaign
940102 but we need to look closely at what is now happening in france and heed the warning their experience is giving us the burgundy region of france has seen several hundred cases in the last two weeks and farmers there are living in fear of the disease
940103 there will always be a few who try to avoid the added costs of vaccinating but they must remember it is not only their own stock they are protecting they are helping the whole of the industry by limiting the chance of the disease spreading to new areas
940104 everyone must be extremely grateful for the sacrifices made by farmers in the south and east of england who suffered losses last year due to movement restrictions at the moment we are still in a strong position in terms of vaccination but it must still be a top priority for those in areas where vaccine isnt yet available
940105 the btv1 strain has come up from morocco moved into spain and is now moving across southern france there is a vaccine available for btv1 and a systemic vaccine is also being worked on to protect against all 24 serotypes
940106 only vaccinated stock should really be moved particularly for farmers at the edge of the protection zone
940107 suckled calf trade may be particularly difficulty and it is all about balancing disease risk against trade implications

940168 the woman who felt its embroidered embrace also felt her interior cage compressed as her organs swam through the living plasma in a panic trying to avoid the rapier ripostes of her ribs
940169 we were aghast at how many massive slabs still remained above the road its not a safe piece of highway and needs to be brought up to current standards
940170 to tell you the truth for the last few years now ive put my foot down on the accelerator every time ive driven along that section
940171 there are rock joints cutting 45 degrees into the cliff they are only marginally stable
940172 there is still a huge amount that will come down whether it happens next year or in 10 years it is hard to say
940173 there have been concerns in the past because the capilano watershed is vancouvers water supply i wouldnt recommend that tankers go down it but it wouldnt take much to upgrade for cars
940174 staff are absolutely confident they would not have gone in to remove that debris if they hadnt been 100 per cent confident of the rock face
940175 we do employment evaluations in which we do criminal record checks and child abuse registry and none of the references gave any indication that he was not a person to be trusted
940176 she was younger than vincent and a very kind very gentle individual
940177 like everyone else i think her response is surprise and shock all of us who had known the family i dont know that anyone could have seen this coming there was nothing predictable about it
940178 she is shocked and very much afraid as to what this is going to mean to her own life
940179 he seemed like a person who was happy to have a job was very committed to doing it well and really there was nothing that would cause him to stand out in any way
940180 theres a lot of people participating already in diving and with the olympics coming theres going to be of course a lot of interest in the sport
940181 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
940182 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
940183 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
940184 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
940185 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
940186 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
940187 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively
940188 because if youre using the correct technique really the incidence of any kind of injury is quite rare
940189 my first advice to them is youre not a trained diver like they are
940190 so first and foremost if youre going to enter the water enter the water feet first thats the safest way to get into any kind of water even if its somewhere youve swam several times
940191 often youve misjudged the depth of the water or you forget that things do change especially in a lake or a river or an open body of water where the bottom will change and where hazards will float through as a result of currents
940192 we encourage people to go out and be healthy and active and hopefully safe while youre doing these activities
940193 one of the things i remembered from when i was about 13 is i watched my first olympics and it was mexico city in 68 and it really had a profound effect on me
940194 well watch it all together and train together and hopefully that will stick in their minds too as something very special
940195 its a shame it happened it wasnt a good decision it was an injustice we did to that young man
940196 tsns footage was inconclusive but with the help of the team we had a perfect view from their sideline footage of what happened
940197 we talked to coaches and the officials and we wanted to be swift with justice as teams asked us to be at the beginning of the season
940198 if there is an opportunity i will do it in person
940199 if not then over the phone hopefully hes man enough to accept our apology we lick our wounds and move on
940200 ireland has no other option at that point there are no recourses for him he cant go to replay
940201 that individual wont be named as its hard enough to attract young officials to the game without persecuting them publicly but well let our clubs know how it will be handled internally
940202 i could say a lot of things but i guess thats what happens when youre the grey cup champions everybody loves you
940203 he was getting into it with an o lineman and the guy just chucked him and he went into the ref
940204 the ref got smoked pretty hard so he thought armour just took him off on purpose
940205 you can say that the provincial nominees programs wherein provinces determine the local needs will be expanded under our plan
940206 its a focus on nation building youll see the elevation of new canadians
940207 may look like an attempt to deliver promises made by the reform party 20 years ago
940208 we deserved something from this game we had a lot of chances and then the game gets spoiled we get frustrated the coaches get frustrated 20 000 fans get frustrated
940209 i cant really comment on that until ive seen the whole incident
940210 i can tell you what amados told me as he was running back in the box the guy elbows him in the face or the chest and amado reacts to it i trust my players and so if hes saying that i believe what hes saying
940211 up until they scored certainly in the first half there were times when we played some really good football
940212 the first half i thought we totally dominated the game
940213 we came out in the second half and started slowly they had a lot of possession and i felt that we were going to come back into the game again and go on and win it and then all of a sudden a crazy incident and nine times out of 10 a referee is refereeing a game they very rarely see those incidents
940214 apparently they tell me the linesman didnt see it didnt say anything
940215 i didnt see it i was in the dugout and was watching the ball
940216 we fought to defend our honour our family and our children
940217 they gave us an ultimatum consider any hilles dead if you do not comply with our request of handing over the criminals who bombed the car last week
940218 the vision for ending the israel palestinian conflict is based on two states but the split between gaza and the west bank and the ongoing israeli settlement expansion policy undermine and jeopardize that vision
940219 we want to eradicate chaos and anarchy criminals and outlaws
940220 hamas is conducting legal searches in the hilles compound which has become the centre of chaos and terror
940221 i think the parties do not have enough motives to reconcile
940222 we can confirm it did not make it to its final destination
940223 hes been flying with us for a few years in that area
940224 our hearts go out to the families involved and thats our priority now
940225 we offer our deepest sympathies to the families and will be working with them and the two seaspan survivors to provide grief and trauma counselling
940226 if this is the only toll free alternative the toll evaders from the pattullo and the port mann are going to find their way to our community over the alex fraser bridge
940227 our streets are congested as it is our community was never built for that kind of traffic north delta is becoming the doormat for everybody going home from work over the alex fraser to surrey and points beyond
940228 people in delta people who live around the alex fraser wont appreciate that

940230 there was a promise implicit in that there would be no tolling of the pattullo bridge so that there was a toll free option offered to commuters
940231 its very disappointing to see now that translink finds itself with inadequate funding to replace this bridge and having to look at tolling it it really narrows the number of options for commuters
940232 a modest toll does not act as a big dissuasion for people to make a travel decision at least thats what all the traffic studies tell us
940233 when you do the traffic modelling what you find and the port mann is the best example is that today when people are spending 4 hours sitting on a bridge wasting time if they have the option of paying a few dollars to get across it a lot faster people will do that
940234 it would cost as much to rehabilitate the pattullo to provide three lanes for 50 years as it would to add three lanes on a new bridge that will last 100 years
940235 it doesnt matter where the 2020 olympic games are held but many of us whove experienced international twenty20 cricket and the ipl are convinced that cricket should bid to become an olympic sport in time for the games
940236 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
940237 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
940238 between 2009 and 2013 cricket would promote itself to the ioc as a prospective sport and if we get it right cricket will be invited to the olympic party in 2020
940239 they would be investing in the future of the sport because by having a mens and womens competition at the olympic games many more countries would be drawn to cricket
940240 it wouldnt surprise me if countries like the usa china italy france and japan become competitive very quickly in twenty20 especially in womens twenty20 i believe that in time the success of cricket at the olympic games will lead to more test playing nations something that the sport will need in the coming century
940241 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 of the worlds population in theory this is a win win for the olympic movement and the icc and its members

940253 he came out unscathed in the attack which was rather puzzling
940254 this is not a popularity contest this is about your stand position and conviction
940255 right now im inclined to support it because it can do the country more good than harm if not we will be left behind even chile has a treaty no man is an island we cannot stand alone as a country
940256 it also becomes equally imperative to file this motion because of the illegal oppressive tyrannical cruel and unjust exercise of powers of agents of government who are supposed to enforce the law
940257 our company has been a beneficiary of the rapid growth of chinese internet users and online video watchers
940258 the overall web video watcher base has been growing very quickly
940259 revenues for 2009 will easily reach the tens of millions of dollars which would put the company in the black
940260 we are set to make profits from next year so were not considering going public until 2010
940261 its just a piece of paper theres nothing to worry about
940262 any change in the armm autonomous region in muslim mindanao or its territory has to go through congress and a plebiscite
940263 there is nothing to implement the negotiating parties cannot move without congress
940264 what will prevent the bangsamoro people from turning their back on the philippines in the future and become a member of the federal states of malaysia
940265 i have always objected to malaysia as mediator because it is not absolutely neutral obviously its officials have foresight and an ulterior motive
940266 to pave the way for charter change that will perpetuate ms arroyos continued stay in power beyond 2010 and remove the remaining nationalist and protectionist provisions of the constitution
940267 bayan muna has no illusions on the sincerity and determination of the arroyo administration to fulfill the aspiration of the moro people for self determination
940268 the government panels continuing insistence on interpreting and implementing any agreement within the framework of the philippine constitution alone immediately undermines the peace process and the right of the moro people to self determination
940269 the court issued a tro temporary restraining order restraining the respondents from signing the moa
940270 this being so the entire process the negotiations involving the said moa and the drafts documents thereof resulting from said negotiations is covered by the doctrine of executive privilege which prevents the disclosure of information that could subvert military or diplomatic objectives
940271 they do not have an unfettered access to everything as these rights are subject to certain limitations
940272 notably there are matters which despite their being of public interest and concern are considered privileged in nature

940274 when investors get too pessimistic thats the time to buy
940275 bok rhetoric has been consistent in the last month on the primacy of the inflation objective
940276 we think a failure to hike at thursdays policy meeting would undermine confidence in their commitment which could trigger won selling pressure and undermine what the authorities were trying to accomplish by ending the weak won policy
940277 everyone still loves to carry this currency but the bank of indonesia protects its upside everyday so it trades in ranges
940278 we think anything less than a 25 basis points hike at the policy meeting on tuesday could turn the tide on the rupiah
940279 we will avoid the use of force unless a situation warrants it
940280 we do not believe that oil products should be exempt from the vat the vat is a tax on consumption and we find no reason why consumers of oil products should be spared from sharing the costs of financing public goods and services they are users of public infrastructure especially roads and the costs of road construction and maintenance should be proportionately shared by all taxpayers who use them
940281 a rate reduction to 10 percent on all commodities would be fairly straightforward and avoid distortion however the government does not have the confidence that it can generate revenues equal to what would be lost it has relied heavily on the rate increase that eased the pressure on becoming more efficient
940282 using the initial projection of government of p54 56 billion vat from oil products in 2008 increasing oil prices should have jacked up collection to about p47 billion this figure is almost equal to the revenue loss from a reduction in the vat rate
940283 government can learn from a similar experience in 1993 when a package of measures was introduced in phases to compensate for the revenue loss from the withdrawal of the oil levy
940284 without corresponding increases in expenditures on school buildings additional teachers and textbooks this system will increase numbers but not the quality of learning it will also result to huge dropouts once discontinued a major part of the burden has been passed on to local governments that have to hire teachers at sub standard rates and build make shift classrooms
940285 public funds are spent on dole out programs that do not give dignity to the poor and perpetuate the culture of political patronage it is disheartening to see mothers with their children queue up under rain or under the sun to receive one time tokens from government it is as if they are lining up for alms from government that is supposed to serve them

940387 i started the ico project ueda san joined my team in japan as a cinematic animator but he created a short movie and presented it to me and said i want to make this game i said yes lets do it but you have never made a game we have to have experienced people do it so it took a while recruiting one person at a time and because fumito ueda doesnt compromise we had to move the development from psone to playstation 2
940388 then i couldnt complete the game because i moved to the united states it took four years and the second game took four years too so i started calling them the olympic team they havent released a ps3 title yet of course not theyll take four years but they have something really really good on the way
940389 we did it as our moral duty we know at present communal forces are eyeing to harm the religious fraternity but we wont let anybody harm that we are muslims and will abide by what our religion says in matters of behaviour with our neighbours no matter what the caste or religion of our neighbour is

940393 its a little too early to tell how safe they the walk in clinics are but there is a big incentive for them to work on the safe side and follow very strict protocols for most things

940395 the amount of time being spent on mundane implementation work is very high
940396 we are still a relatively small chain and are able to monitor consumer reviews on the main sites directly but as we expand we will probably have to review this all our hotels monitor their consumer reviews and the general managers are required to reply to all negative comments if the site allows it we also encourage them to subscribe to google alerts and monitor what consumers are writing on blogs reputation management is now just as important as brand management with google universal search becoming more widespread it will be imperative for hotels not only to monitor consumer reviews which for example are already being displayed on google local business listings but also to participate and start posting images and videos online about their property and destination

940409 the rate of improvement in the eyes of the customer is frustratingly slow

940434 they dominated the midfield in the first half but we plucked those holes to deny them room in the second period
940435 we also had that missed penalty but these things happen in football we are happy with the point but obviously we would have loved to win
940436 the issue of being left out in the starting line up has been haunting me for a long time and i feel now its the time to tell them that they mustnt call me for national duty if they feel im not good enough
940437 if i continue sitting on the bench in the next game i will withdraw my services to the national team and concentrate on club football it will be better because im satisfied
940438 people would want to say i play the same role as esrom but i dont think its the reason because we have been playing alongside each other for a long time now
940439 i confronted him after our last match after i came in six minutes from time and he told me he wanted a strong bench
940440 i was not satisfied with that answer and i feel i have reached my peak now so i should play and after thinking about that i decided to come out in the open to tell him that he must not call me if i am not to play
940441 the only problem we faced was securing travel documents for some of the players
940442 argentina used the game to show that their earlier performances in the tourney were not just flukes
940443 if the irb really wants to help develop the game in a place where the play is already strong then why not give argentina a little extra support in this way
940444 there are some within the psl who feel the negotiating team should have pushed for a much higher figure but again when this us 100 000 was agreed upon almost two months ago it was based on the old mutual rates of the day but a lot has changed since then and that kind of money is no longer as attractive as it used to be
940445 that would pre empt the whole thing and would also not be fair to the sponsors but that tournament will be one of the items to be discussed during the psl assembly in kwekwe on saturday yesterday

940449 chaos for sure maybe a workers revolution but looking at the situation as it is now it is more likely to be a re run of germany post 1929 and some form of an extreme right wing movement will emerge
940450 its a bit too soon to talk about a place in the world cup we have a long way to go even if it looks easy when you say two games

940456 when we say that a historian or a linguist is innumerate we mean that he cannot even begin to understand what scientists and mathematicians are talking about it is perhaps possible to distinguish two different aspects of numeracy that should concern the sixth former

940460 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
940461 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
940462 its important to note that the new estimate does not represent an actual increase in the number of new infections but reflects our ability to more precisely measure hiv incidence and secure a better understanding of the epidemic
940463 this new picture reveals that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known and underscores the challenges in confronting this disease
940464 too many americans continue to be affected by this disease
940465 these new findings emphasise the importance of reaching all hiv infected individuals and those at risk with effective prevention programmes
940466 prevention can and does work when we apply what we know
940467 while the level of hiv incidence is alarming stability in recent years suggests that prevention efforts are having an impact
940468 in this decade more people are living with hiv and living longer than ever before due to advances in treatment even though this could mean more opportunities for transmission the number of new infections has not increased overall
940469 these data confirm the critical need to revitalise prevention efforts for gay and bisexual men of all races and to build upon the growing momentum in the african american and hispanic communities to confront hiv
940470 we must all remember that we are dealing with one of the most insidious infectious diseases in history reducing this threat will require action from everyone individuals at risk community leaders government agencies and the private sector

940568 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
940569 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
940570 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
940571 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
940572 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
940573 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
940574 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
940575 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
940576 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
940577 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
940578 how the disciple became the guru is it time for the u s to learn workforce development from former disciple india
940579 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
940580 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
940581 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
940582 i am so desperately sad that craig died from the injuries he sustained at brands hatch yesterday he was a really super young guy and only on the saturday evening was i chatting to him in the paddock with him telling me about his wsb ambitions for 2009 craig was so determined and professional would always say hello and enthusiastically keep me in touch with his progress
940583 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
940584 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
940585 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
940586 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
940587 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
940588 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
940589 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
940590 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
940591 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
940592 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
940593 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
940594 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
940595 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
940596 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
940597 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
940598 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
940599 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
940600 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
940601 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
940602 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
940603 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
940604 the significance of the new un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities for the practice of institutional psychiatry
940605 i propose that law school faculties and administrations treat the announcement as a wake up call and recognize how much they have allowed themselves to be at the mercy of editors whose primary interest is selling magazines rather than providing a means of ranking schools that actually might promote the things that make for genuine greatness in a law school

940607 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
940608 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
940609 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
940610 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
940611 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
940612 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
940613 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
940614 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
940615 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
940616 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
940617 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
940618 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
940619 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
940620 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
940621 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
940622 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves

940632 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
940633 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
940634 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
940635 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
940636 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
940637 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
940638 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
940639 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
940640 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
940641 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
940642 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
940643 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
940644 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
940645 het is met een beste snelheid gegaan want we vonden de radiator aan de andere kant van het huis
940646 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
940647 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
940648 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
940649 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
940650 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
940651 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
940652 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
940653 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
940654 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
940655 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
940656 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
940657 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
940658 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
940659 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
940660 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
940661 what we a found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
940662 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
940663 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
940664 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
940665 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
940666 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
940667 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
940668 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
940669 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
940670 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
940671 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
940672 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
940673 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
940674 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
940675 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
940676 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
940677 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
940678 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
940679 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
940680 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
940681 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
940682 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
940683 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
940684 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
940685 our study sheds new light on how that process works
940686 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
940687 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
940688 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
940689 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
940690 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
940691 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
940692 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
940693 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
940694 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
940695 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
940696 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
940697 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
940698 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
940699 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
940700 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
940701 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
940702 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
940703 perhaps the prime ministers staff feared that the attention of journalists was being drawn to the breast over his left shoulder rather than to what he was saying
940704 imagine being dressed properly and comfy wherever and whenever the brand nat 2 makes it possible by using its two in one system all tops are interchangeable which allows one to combine colours materials and styles

940720 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
940721 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
940722 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality it seems natural to talk about sex to remove taboos and the label of sinfulness

940726 collaboration with terrific colleagues and students in new mexico has only strengthened my desire to dedicate my energies to the many fascinating issues facing higher education i look forward to the new challenges of this position and to returning home to ann arbor
940727 unquestionably the most significant development in legal education in the post world war ii era has been the growth of the skills curriculum
940728 occupy an important place in the curriculum of virtually all to transmit the skills and values necessary to legal practice and to supplement the forms of legal knowledge that effective and responsible lawyers require clinicians have created as part of their scholarly achievements theories about lawyering

940734 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
940735 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
940736 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
940737 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
940738 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
940739 must learn abundant amounts of theory and vast bodies of knowledge but the bottom line
940740 most law faculty members have attractive alternatives in the world of practice
940741 to be effective preparation for a variety of legal careers legal education must provide a foundation in both analytical and practical learning
940742 law schools do some things well but they do some things poorly or not at all
940743 taught by instructors who are themselves not regular members of the faculty
940744 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
940745 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
940746 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
940747 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
940748 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
940749 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
940750 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
940751 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
940752 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
940753 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
940754 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
940755 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
940756 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
940757 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
940758 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
940759 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
940760 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
940761 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
940762 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
940763 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
940764 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
940765 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
940766 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
940767 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
940768 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
940769 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
940770 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
940771 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
940772 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
940773 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
940774 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
940775 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
940776 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
940777 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
940778 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
940779 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
940780 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
940781 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
940782 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
940783 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
940784 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
940785 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side

940793 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
940794 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
940795 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
940796 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
940797 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
940798 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
940799 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
940800 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
940801 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
940802 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
940803 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
940804 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
940805 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
940806 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
940807 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
940808 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
940809 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
940810 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
940811 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
940812 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
940813 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
940814 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
940815 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
940816 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
940817 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
940818 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
940819 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
940820 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
940821 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
940822 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
940823 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
940824 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
940825 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
940826 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
940827 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
940828 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
940829 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
940830 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
940831 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
940832 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
940833 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
940834 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
940835 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
940836 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
940837 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
940838 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
940839 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
940840 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
940841 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
940842 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
940843 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
940844 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
940845 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
940846 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
940847 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
940848 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
940849 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
940850 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
940851 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
940852 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
940853 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
940854 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
940855 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here

940877 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
940878 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
940879 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
940880 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
940881 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
940882 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
940883 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
940884 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
940885 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
940886 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me

940888 i personally dont think a professor should be fantasizing like that but you cant prevent that as long as hes not doing something to fulfill the fantasy you cant do anything
940889 she said she could never imagine going to his office to discuss questions
940890 thats where the problem lies with all of this he wont be able to do his job i dont think students would feel safe having a one on one meeting with him
940891 first to meet the families of the men that i represent in guantanamo and second to do what i can to promote the cause of these men
940892 and theres a certain amount of normalcy that has settled over the normal miserable conditions of confinement which amount to solitary confinement without sleep and without sunlight and without anyone to talk to so at the news conference i said that in addition to this torment which has become so typical that we dont even talk about it anymore now the torment also consists of constant body searches in which the men are required to pull their shirts up to their chest drop their pants and then the corn fed u s military sticks their thumbs under the prisoners underwear band and circles the prisoners torsos
940893 at the press conference in yemen this is a society where the rule of morality is so strict i wanted to drive home the degree of humiliation that these searches cause by illustrating a typical body search the physical abuse they can stand the verbal abuse they can stand but when the military punishes muslim men by shaving off their beard or by forcing them to disrobe for a muslim man that is a thousand times more cutting than a westerner can imagine and thats what i was trying to dramatize the reaction to what i did makes me very sad i wish people paid as much attention to the suffering and torment in guantanamo as they paid to the way i sought to dramatize it
940894 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
940895 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf

940908 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
940909 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality

940913 allowed me to send a message to the american people that the judgments i have made and the judgments i will make are ones that are going to result in them being safer
940914 its ok for the muslims to do what theyre doing and no one arrests them but then if we start saying and disagreeing with whats actually happening then were breaching community cohesion and we get arrested for it
940915 even if they wanted to give away american sovereignity obama and the congressional democrats couldnt do that without a constitutional amendment or at least a vote of the people could they

940967 abuse of alcohol is one of the ills that we have to address as a nation
940968 which have resulted in families falling apart and domestic violence
940969 the president should accept that there are no recreational facilities and he should come up with alternatives
940970 i am young and when i am done with university classes what will i do
940971 we have to buy from suppliers who will also increase their selling prices and we will have to do the same if we have to make profit i do not see people coming to buy alcohol
940972 we are talking to the government to make them understand the implication of the price hikes
940973 we share the governments concern about the harmful effects of irresponsible consumption and abuse but while the increase in prices may limit access by some people it does not address the pertinent matter of alcohol abuse and associated effects

940977 the disparity in the numbers is indeed hard to reconcile as photojournalists we always strive to be fair we have tried to be balanced but it seems that in a large operation such as ours we need to monitor the use of political images even more closely
940978 theyre going to try to make you afraid of me hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
940979 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
940980 theyre going to say that i am a risky guy
940981 the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because we are afraid
940982 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
940983 look at me see im black admit you are a racist
940984 i found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mothers race

940986 keen to have partners if we had some multibillionaire that wanted a stake in newcastle it will help
940987 roman abramovich has unfortunately got however tens of billions more than me
940988 that lot from qpr have got tens and tens of billions more than newcastle it would be very useful if we could get some multibillionaire partners the qpr model looks very interesting its something that newcastle needs to look at its got to be able to compete
940989 at any time there are companies in the world who are prepared to let you see their financials books
940990 i wasnt worrying about not having scored we are still in pre season and my focus is on playing games and getting match fit for the start of the season
940991 of course as a striker it is nice to score at any time even in training and i am pleased that i have got my first goal for stockport
940992 after the game i said that i should have had a goal in all three games i have played so far
940993 last saturday against liverpool in my first match i hit the inside of the post and then in midweek against macclesfield town i did score but it was disallowed for offside although i think the linesman got it wrong
940994 so only for a few inches and a decision that went against me i would have had three goals now but i am happy with one and with my performances
940995 hopefully the goal on saturday can be a springboard though and i can go on and score more when the season starts next weekend
940996 i have been in a hotel since i came back over to stockport but i have seen a place i like and hopefully i can get that sorted out and be in there within the week
940997 i have felt settled since i came over but having somewhere to call home will help me settle even more
940998 it will be good to have that sorted out with the season starting next saturday and then i can focus on playing football
940999 weve a couple of big games to start with huddersfield are expecting a big crowd next saturday and then we have leicester city who are one of the favourites to go up from league one
941000 it is a fairy tale to captain your country and a fairy tale ending would have been to lift the ashes urn next year but it was not to be
941001 i know that it is the right time my mind has told me it is not working as well as it once did i wish my mind was fresher and i could have taken it on another year and had another stab at the australians but i have had five unbelievable years
941002 captaining england is an unbelievable privilege and it is a great feeling to lead out your country
941003 i know how proud my mum and dad have been and when i spoke to my dad this morning to tell him the news he said you can walk away a proud lad because you have given it everything and that is all he ever asked me to do
941004 its the best job in the world but things come to an end and its not something i worry about i mean thats life
941005 i havent had enough but ill know when the time is right
941006 its not ideal but at the minute its the best thing for the team
941007 i couldnt bear to look at myself in the mirror couldnt stand the sound of my voice i just couldnt take tracey emin any more i just hope that visitors will be able to cut themselves off a bit from the tracey thing
941008 one bloke told me my work made him feel embarrassed at being a man
941009 there is no genre of painting with which i would rather be associated less
941010 youll see in our selection criteria that were way past the stage of medically checking someone and saying theyre not going to damage themselves so let them compete
941011 i am more optimistic as time goes on my crystal ball is unfortunately not working very well so ill wait and see where we are but as things positively progress thats good news
941012 id like to see him at the long jump qualifiers in beijing on 16 august its a great shame for chris whos had a very promising winter well wait and see what happens we will fly him out business class into beijing to give him the best possible chance
941013 hes not coming out for the trip none of these guys are coming for the trip theyre coming to perform so we want to put him on the ground with the best possible chance to perform there would be a practical deadline of five six days before the event when a decision is made
941014 there has been a little buzz surrounding john edwards and his alleged affair
941015 because the only source has been the national enquirer we have decided not to cover the rumours or salacious speculations
941016 the democratic party in its quest for power has managed a propaganda campaign with subliminal messages creating a god like figure in a man who falls short in every way
941017 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralise this country and help create a socialist america
941018 those who think that lying on application forms will give them any advantage need to realise that their efforts are counter productive
941019 fraud data sharing and the linking of individuals address histories by credit reference agencies means that such lies are identified applications are turned down and the details recorded telling the truth even if it is slightly less palatable remains the best policy
941020 as a result not only are fraudsters turning their attentions to accounts that are already in existence but consumers and anti fraud departments are also feeling the effects more lies are being told to gain credit and this creates even greater workloads on the desks of those on the front line

941025 but it must be stressed that when exercising this right citizens must respect and not harm others freedoms and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
941026 no matter whether you win or lose above all do it with spirit
941027 ive watched the last couple of games and it is hard to believe that glenn ferguson is 39 years old
941028 he still knows where the net is but no matter how old you get i suppose that is something you never lose
941029 i know i can learn a lot from him and hopefully i can do that playing alongside him this season
941030 it wasnt that i didnt want to sign for linfield there were just a few terms that i wanted to get sorted out and there wasnt time
941031 a few more discussions took place that got things sorted out and i was able to sign
941032 i have been having treatment for a thigh injury from the linfield physios after i did my pre season training in scotland with hamilton and wasnt ready to play on saturday but i am looking forward to getting into training tonight
941033 i know there is pressure at linfield but i have been involved in successive relegation battles with wrexham and i know what that pressure felt like
941034 i am happy for there to be pressure on me i think any player would rather have pressure on them to play at the top of their game and to be winning trophies than not having that
941035 i expect the fans at linfield to be demanding they are the biggest club in northern ireland
941036 the fans at wrexham didnt always give the players an easy ride but that pressure is part and parcel of being a footballer and to be successful you have to be thick skinned
941037 i am confident in myself and my own ability and confident that i will prove myself to the linfield fans
941038 i have been made to feel comfortable by the manager david jeffrey and now i just want to get my fitness built up again and start playing
941039 unfortunately the shortage of bins is affecting the whole of the uk and not just lewisham
941040 it is an absolute nightmare at the moment because we are not getting any through whatsoever its been getting steadily worse since may and supply has come to a virtual standstill even for us and we are supposed to be priority customers for the factories
941041 factories are working on full production but the bins are being diverted to eastern europe where recycling campaigns are being set up
941042 its been a long summer of hard work in the gym and pool but ive finally been given the go ahead that the wrist is back to its best and i cant wait to get back playing at the highest level again
941043 i had committed myself to glentoran for another two years and had fully intended to see out my playing days at the club i grew up supporting but there was a bit of a dispute about terms over the summer and the club moved to sign another goalkeeper
941044 it has been a difficult and uncertain few months but my desire to play again has been the overwhelming factor
941045 i have now secured my release and am now looking for a new challenge
941046 i still have a lot to offer a club at the highest level and i cant wait to pull on the gloves again
941047 doing prep season training alone was difficult but anyone who knows me will tell you how hard i work and that hasnt changed
941048 premiership and european football have been a regular occurrence over the last few years and i am determined to get that back as soon as i can
941049 this is one of the largest media centres ever built by some distance
941050 we worked very hard to understand the scale of the olympics the numbers are staggering even last week the quantity of people there was absolutely unbelievable there is a real buzz about the place
941051 from the beginning we looked carefully at the centres environment
941052 the chinese are very sensitive to culture that was critical that is why you can see the pagoda shape in the roof
941053 celebrity style treatment reserved for hollywood a listers a working journalists paradise where every need and whim is catered for including masseurs chefs fitness trainers and hair stylists
941054 it is quite spacious and well appointed but i am not sure luxurious is the right word
941055 i think it will be less spacious once it is cluttered up with journalists they have a canteen and that was ok but it wasnt exactly caviar on toast i think if the food is good the journalists there will be grateful because they will be stuck in there for so long its not like you can step out and go to a restaurant instead there is so much security around the perimeter
941056 if you google words such as the dalai lama the oppressed movement falun gong or even the chinese language version of the bbc website you have problems
941057 we have confirmation now that 145 people have been killed
941058 we found eight to 10 stones which had fallen off and probably scared the people causing the stampede
941059 many children and women were shouting for help and i saw people tumbling down the hillside
941060 there were rumours of boulders coming down on us and we all ran like the others
941061 i rushed to the spot in search of my three children who had gone to pray at the hilltop shrine
941062 i fail to understand why god was so cruel to us
941063 the big thing for us is that our attitude is right and if it is then the ability of the squad will carry us through
941064 from the very first night i trained at portadown the attitude has been spot on and there has been nobody moping around and thinking that they dont want to be playing at this level
941065 we were determined to set down a marker on saturday and show everyone that we are still here and to show what we can do
941066 we want to get straight back into the premiership and we want to do it as emphatically as we can
941067 there is maybe a slight fear that if we keep winning 7 0 then we might think that it is easy and we only have to turn up to win games but everyone in the dressing room is professional enough to know that doesnt happen and we have to keep performing at a high level to make sure that we get three points every week and get ourselves promoted as quickly as possible
941068 the costs being incurred by organic producers are rising much faster than for conventional production
941069 the price we get currently for organic milk is not high enough to cover the cost of production there will have to be an increase in the price that producers receive
941070 in this context it is no longer attractive for conventional farms to convert and we are seeing producers undergoing conversion exiting that process the concern is that the relatively small number of leavers becomes a mass exit among existing producers
941071 there is a real danger that a supply shortage could take hold rather quickly if just 30 of our larger organic farms revert to non organic production we will lose 10 per cent of our supplies
941072 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers
941073 it is a bitter irony for us but after so many years of talking about the virtues of growing your own and british produce people are doing it and it is resulting in a fall in trade
941074 we normally see a 20 per cent drop in sales in summer which lasts from july to september but now that period is being extended to from june until november
941075 people are still coming to us but it is for more exotic things they cannot produce themselves and that means bigger imports we have gone from being 85 per cent british to 78 per cent
941076 if we go back in to gaza hamas will kill us
941077 a change of that magnitude is more than we have seen in 20 million years
941078 if we had wanted to destroy as much of life on earth as possible there would have been no better way of doing it than to dig up and burn as much fossil hydrocarbon as we possible could
941079 anglicans are a profoundly diverse community who nonetheless live tolerantly with each other
941080 as of close of business on friday a deal was not done and i have had no confirmation since from barcelona
941081 barcelona were thinking of a loan but the player is keen on a transfer and is waiting to fly to glasgow
941082 the figures are a scathing indictment of how profoundly us prevention efforts have failed
941083 there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the last 10 years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with effective public health strategies
941084 over the first half of the year us oil demand surpassed all negative expectations
941085 several factors point to a possible falling back in prices towards the end of 2008
941086 providing commodity prices continue to ease inflation is kept under control and the credit markets improve over the next year growth should resume next year albeit modestly
941087 these are the same people using the same tactics that brought us george w bush and look what a disaster he is
941088 for the last 8 years bush with mccains support have lost the respect of our allies wont it be great and powerful to regain that respect so the us does not have to go it alone
941089 for the last 8 years americans have been ashamed of its leaders wont it be great to have a leader again that has won the respect of both world leaders and the people they represent
941090 this is the support we had after 9 11 and then bush with mccains support squandered it to john mccain it is a big joke something to mock and hes spending millions of dollars to belittle me this time when you vote vote as if your whole world depended on it because it does
941091 theres a good reason john mccain does not draw large enthusiastic crowds he has nothing to say that george bush has not been saying and he does not know what he is talking about when he does
941092 john mccain claims to have experience but has it been useful he didnt know you were hurting economically he didnt even understand who the enemy is in iraq he still has not apologized to the american people for promoting and voting for the war in iraq
941093 john mccain brought to you by the same people who brought you george bush
941094 why has the united states been able to hold an olympics three times because it is a strong country now we are the host it is a sign of state power
941095 the large star represents the communist party and the other four stars form a semicircle around it
941096 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
941097 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
941098 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
941099 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
941100 im excited its good to have him back in the house
941101 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
941102 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
941103 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
941104 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
941105 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
941106 if we played a game tomorrow would be the starting quarterback
941107 im not going to change any direction that weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation tomorrow and we have all the confidence in the world in aaron
941108 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
941109 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
941110 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing
941111 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
941112 in the prevailing market conditions this is a resilient performance which enables us to maintain our capital strength continue with our dividend policy and balance the need to conserve capital with our commitment to make it available for investment in our fast growing businesses
941113 there arent too many coaches who would want to rush one of those out the door
941114 having said that i wouldnt nail any players feet down to stay at the club
941115 if david healy or any player came to me and told me they wanted to leave then i would let it happen i dont believe in holding a player at a club against his will and i wont do it
941116 no club has matched our valuation of steven davis and im glad about that
941117 he is a great footballer and you can never have enough of those in your squad
941118 i know there is interest from other clubs and im not surprised
941119 but he is the sort of player i would like to hold on to
941120 i was a kid when i watched audley win on tv and that inspired me to think of becoming an olympic champion myself i know i am as good if not better than he was at the time if he can do it so can i
941121 dave is more mobile than audley he hits harder and has more heart
941122 if he keeps his cool he can win this tournament theres not a lot out there
941123 what appeals to me about boxing is the respect you get off people and the way it makes you feel about yourself
941124 because i think they were trying to get me on the cheap
941125 having the next olympics in your own country is a big draw but ill be 29 by then
941126 theres obviously a pile of money to be made as a heavyweight these days and i know i have the power to adapt
941127 i do believe that if i get that bit of luck with the draw i can come back with a medal ideally the gold
941128 i dont think the police will find her killer now its too late for that theres no new evidence no new witnesses after eight years
941129 we are considering the ramifications of the jurys verdict before we do anything else
941130 it can be difficult with cold case reviews because the whos wheres and whens in the witness statements arent going to change
941131 if you havent got any new forensics it can be tricky to find new leads
941132 i dont want to spend any more time in any of her majestys holiday camps
941133 its not a celebration barry was locked away for eight years for something he didnt do
941134 i was struck by the fact there was a huge demand in the uk for somebodys head the pressure on the police must have been enormous
941135 in considering a case of this complexity the police and those responsible for the prosecution need to keep an open mind as far as possible as to who is responsible i think they did close their mind after the arrest of barry george
941136 were not going to comment on the number of suspected cases that get reported to us between suspected cases being confirmed clinical vigilance led to the rapid diagnosis of pml this speaks for the physician educational programmes that are going on in europe and the united states
941137 id rather not say but the risk of pml is clearly stated in our label they sign something that they understand that risk
941138 clinical vigilance is clearly working as weve seen in these cases
941139 online piracy thrives not only because of the widespread availability of free top tier entertainment but because the venues themselves are now well known well liked and habitually used
941140 even when the price approaches zero all other things being equal people are more likely to act habitually than to break their habit in a digital arena consumers go to venues where they feel comfortable
941141 i suppose there is a degree of brand loyalty to these networks people obviously get familiar with using certain services and certain websites and thats part of the problem
941142 but its not true to say that the internet is uncontrollable the difficulty is that until now nothing has been done about the problem we need to better communicate why its important to support the artists
941143 we have not exactly covered ourselves in glory with some pretty unedifying behaviour by senior members of the party
941144 breath of fresh air after the stale self indulgent solipsism from warwick
941145 he probably felt he needed to set himself up as the heir apparent
941146 and whatever has happened this week it has worked now everyone is talking about david miliband as the heir apparent
941147 he would mark a return to the old blair policies that is not going to be helpful in a general election campaign we need to find a unity candidate
941148 hes a brilliant guy but he is not achieving everything he should have done
941149 are they serious about carrying all of this stuff on or is there a bottom line we are in a game of brinkmanship they cannot get rid of him brown so the worst case scenario is they plunge us even deeper into civil war
941150 welcome to the world of winning the first of many
941151 for sure it was a surprise that we werent as quick as we should have been
941152 what could i do when you have a puncture last year i probably lost the championship on a puncture so its nothing new to me but it is nowhere near as bad as it could be i think i salvaged the best of the worst i guess we could have had felipe and kimi right at the front congratulations to heikki he did a fantastic job and im really happy and glock did well too they are taking points away from everyone else which was good
941153 its difficult to say what felipe was doing but i was catching him every lap and the car felt particularly good
941154 i was cautious in the first two stints after running into trouble previously with tyre degradation i kept my own pace and tried to increase it bit by bit and in the last stint it all worked fine
941155 of course i am very happy there have been various incidents this year when i was in a position to challenge for the win and things have gone wrong and not functioned properly halfway through the race it started to work for me better and i could put pressure on felipe and hope for something to happen it worked fine for me today so i am happy for me and all the hard work the team put in over the last few months its very respectable and im very glad to score the first victory its fantastic a great moment and a moment i have been targeting for many years now since i started getting the idea about being an f1 driver its very pleasing finally to achieve this result
941156 i couldnt believe it when i saw felipes engine go i was under pressure from kimi in the final stint on the soft tyres we knew from friday that theyd be difficult we were fast at hockenheim but then came the big crash but here in budapest we kept our speed and the car was perfect until it got a bit tricky in the last stint to finish on the podium makes it just a perfect weekend
941157 a year on from the first indications of the credit crisis these results are not quite as bad as expected
941158 but its clear as the other major banks report this week we are still labouring under its severe effects
941159 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
941160 globally consumer confidence is declining and the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
941161 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in crdit availability is accelerating this process
941162 at first i wanted to stay in the premier league and i had the pen in my hand to sign
941163 then at the last minute they said that the chairman wasnt here and i had to wait so i said okay i would come back tomorrow
941164 then the gaffer called me up about rangers and spoke very well with me and i chose rangers it was very difficult to leave england but i think this was a good choice
941165 i know its a big club last year they won two trophies its a dream to come to rangers because they play in europe every year its the ambition of every player to play in the champions league or the uefa cup which is why i came here
941166 he contacted me and spoke very well after i signed for rangers he wished me good luck
941167 ill have to train on my own on monday and tuesday because the team will be away so i will just concentrate on this game
941168 the bbfc should realise there are scenes of gratuitous violence in the dark knight to which i would certainly not take my 11 year old daughter
941169 broke into the computer network at the earle naval weapons station stealing computer passwords and shutting down the network in the immediate aftermath of the september 11 terrorist attacks
941170 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power
941171 the iranians have had more than enough time to respond
941172 if iran doesnt choose to engage there is no option but further sanctions
941173 as soon as 2010 iran will have the option to reach uranium production at military levels
941174 our understanding with the us was good throughout and it never came to acrimony but they are the biggest subsidisers in the world in terms of what affects us so we will have to see them in court
941175 i dont have any problem if they want to offer a partial deal that puts a cap on their subsidies
941176 but countries want the power to say no to some things in order to get what they want i dont think partial deals work in a system like the wto
941177 this was in slow motion and now it will be accelerated
941178 these things all have merits but in relation to the doha round they are all second best because they are not dealing with the main distortion to world trade which is subsidies
941179 its a period movie set in victorian england so were very specific about the look we need
941180 in an ideal world out of the 125 women we need they would all have long naturally coloured hair wed love men with beards or facial hair lamb chops or big sideburns that sort of thing
941181 there are three main benefits with an event of this kind
941182 firstly we cant overestimate the amount of money the cast and crew of the film will spend in plymouth while they are here secondly the pr that will be brought to the city and thirdly the number of film lovers who will come here to catch a glimpse of the sites on the film
941183 all you have to do is look at what doc martin the itv comedy starring martin clunes has done for port isaac a resort 30 miles north west of plymouth to see the effect
941184 the locations chosen in plymouth had just the right feel for the needs of the film
941185 our primary role is to attract productions to come to film in this region and were absolutely delighted to attract such a big production to the south west
941186 natagora went far too fast for our leader but i got a good position anyway
941187 mine was looking about a bit in the final furlong but that is normal on a straight course and why i changed my whip
941188 she was able to follow the pace without being too keen
941189 she is an exceptional filly with a lot of speed
941190 we dont lose anything by being patient to get the deal done
941191 you have to get the timing right or it can have an adverse effect
941192 you see these kids yearning to compete in the olympics you watch them working over the years and then see them when all their hopes are destroyed ive seen some cruelty in my life but this is right up there
941193 choosing beijing as the host city for the olympics you will bring the first ever games in olympic history to a nation containing one fifth of the worlds population and 1 3 billion chinese people will dedicate their efforts to the olympic movement if you award the olympics to beijing i can assure you that seven years later you will be proud of the decision you make today
941194 it is quite unprecedented how beijing has transformed itself in the last six or seven years
941195 i hope china holds the olympics successfully and our countrys economic situation can be more prosperous people in beijing will become more friendly and warm hearted because we will welcome a lot of people from all over the world
941196 to see how temporary measures will impact on air quality
941197 if you are dissatisfied you can complain directly to liu qi president of bocog
941198 for the chinese sporting events represent something deep and fundamental a validation of their nations long labours towards international acceptance a sign that china has become a full member of the community of nations
941199 her first words were that she was very happy to see very nice people she was very pleased about that she was ecstatic
941200 we wanted to make sure mr rockefeller was outside to apprehend him outside away from his child was the best case scenario
941201 if the offense is merely steady it finished the season on a tear with joe ganz at quarterback averaging 53 points over the last three games and pelinis initial efforts are good enough just to progress back toward the mean defensively that is to split the difference between the best case scenario of his lone season as coordinator and the worst case scenario of last years collapse this is unavoidably one of the most improved teams in the country and an impending threat to missouris supposed stranglehold on the division
941202 like belinda carlisle and the ku comes around about once every 10 years or so to make a brief appearance then only to disappear into the black bowels of nothingness the squaks were a 2007 byproduct of luck and insanely lucky scheduling no such luck this year
941203 so what do we do with all those statues of women scattered around dozens of italian museums where often the breasts admired would leave even pamela anderson deflated
941204 ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
941205 to consult on the nuclear issue and the right of states to peaceful enrichment
941206 exchange ideas aimed at clarifying irans commitment to all international agreements
941207 i just tasted a wine from oklahoma made by college students in oklahoma with oklahoma grapes that im going to tell you beats the living snot out of 90 per cent of the california red meritage wines that ive had under 20 us bones dollars in the last 36 months that was a lot of numbers did you follow that fifteen bones under 20 36 months thats three years folks
941208 that was six im telling you i am baffled right now baffled mott you have to taste this
941209 i am shocked how good this wine is great blackberry flavours dancing through a very obvious and well structured mid palate that so many wines my friend so many wines miss under oaked thank you no oak monster aargh this is an absolutely balanced effort this is why we need to do blind tastings with wine douchebags bring them in put this wine in a tasting blind and people will be humbled hard all day all day
941210 ive got 847 in my inbox and i cleaned it up last night
941211 this is a fans request im like ok ninety nine per cent of the wines on the show ive never tasted so its all improv like this hello everybody welcome to wine library tv i am your host gary vay ner chuk and this my friends oh this is the thunder show aka the internets happiest little place on earth
941212 roadside brush where you get some twigs and minerality from rocks but where you also might get a dirty band aid or a half busted coke can
941213 i want to bring it to the masses and i want people to realise it can be a lot of fun i want people to trust their own palate i dont think there are so many rules
941214 why im here today is because i listened to that exact advice instead of wanting to learn about the classic bordeaux and just about california i was curious about south africa and spain and australia which became big platforms for me years down the road in the industry ive got a very different palate to a lot of people i love vegetables i want to drink v8 juice before i drink apple or orange juice
941215 im very comfortable in my own skin and i want to show people that if i can have wine knowledge then they can too its very important to me
941216 i want to touch people not in inappropriate ways just a hug or a handshake i love gathering people together i like getting people pumped up i love leveraging new media twitter and facebook all these things just so i can interact with more people
941217 i really did not drink any wine i might have had a sip here and there but i would tell you i probably did not even consume a full glass when i tell you my mom and dad did a great job they did a great job if i had not grown up in the liquor industry i probably would have never drunk alcohol in my life
941218 i knew i would hit other people i would never hit with wine library tv
941219 i definitely sold enough to pull another one out of my ass as long people still want it and read it i think i will be doing it yearly i also did it for my mom to have the ability to run around town and tell everybody i was an author
941220 do i have a date in mind you know i think its going to take 15 years realistically they are going to cost me a couple of billion dollars so i need to really hit it out the park but i think i can
941221 i actually didnt realise the show had aired and when i came back from an errand that afternoon there was already a couple on the doorstep who had driven 50 miles to make sure they got a case before it sold out
941222 we only made 40 cases of that particular wine and we had no idea what we were getting into we have been inundated with phone calls and emails and demand from at least 20 different states which has turned our business upside down he has an impact thats for sure his disciples believe in his palate
941223 i just get inspired i come in and i think whats going on in austria whats going on in germany i want some champagne tonight its like scratching my own itch
941224 something tells me that vaynerchuk has spent little if any time in north eastern italy
941225 i think i had a lot of street cred in the wine industry prior to this im sure that behind closed doors theres definitely some things being said about my style im not sure everybody wants to hear wine being referred to as whatever i just said on the show knowing my personality i thought it might cause some ruckus but ive been pretty impressed that people have accepted it
941226 if theres a deal i cant say no to if nbc says tuesday night at 8pm before heroes my ego will probably not allow me to say no but i believe internet television is the future i am fascinated by television i could go there but i would lose enormous amounts of control perhaps 15 per cent of what i just did probably wouldnt be allowed and thats a problem a big problem
941227 guys can you do me a favour grab a glass and taste that wine there i need you to tell me i havent lost my mind
941228 if you could see this wine now you would be saying this is seriously weird shit the colour of this wineis like aging copper in fact i sometimes call it the penny wine it is definitely not a colour that would encourage many white fans to put this in their mouths it looks more like battery acid or apple cider than wine in some respects the colour is reflected in the smell there is almosta rusty nail aroma which is followed by some spoiled papaya not sold you throw some rusty nails and papaya in my mouth and im excited
941229 too many people get a little bit of wine knowledge under their belt and suddenly feel like they need to start dissing white wine so here is a white that i think could totally bring those hard core red wine drinkers back to reality if you only like red wine with your steak i challenge you to pop this with your fillet mignon or other rich foods you may realise how serious white can be
941230 if you were starting a winery in california and asked me which grapes to plant riesling would not be in my top 10 maybe not even my top 100 rieslings belong in california like germans belong on surfboards yet this producer has been getting the best from grapes since 1984 making some very good varietally representative riesling at a price that i simply cant resist show me a wine that hits my sweet spot for everyday value while expressing the true character of the grape and im a buyer
941231 part of me hates it that ros is suddenly so trendy the problem is that a lot of ros s are pretty basic simple and not all that exciting no wonder pink wine gets a bad rap but boy did this wine just blitzkrieg my palate
941232 you have cancer and it will spread to your brain as long as you dont help us wait for rafah crossing the rarely open exit to egypt

941239 foyleside shopping centre is delighted to be launching the very first foyle fashion week which im sure will be a must see event for fashion lovers for many years to come
941240 the two day livin dolls event will enhance the shopping experience and bring even more life to foyleside we wish converse group and everyone else involved with the organising of the various events every success

941249 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad i actually have three responses
941250 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
941251 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
941252 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
941253 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
941254 has there been one moment on this trail where someone has inspired you to perhaps change your stance on an issue

941256 felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed at what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end
941257 we now have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part
941258 we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as prepared as possible for the european grand prix
941259 as you saw everything was perfect then you know what happened and it did so without warning without the slightest indication
941260 unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport but these things can happen

941302 as always check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants
941303 i was thinking of a wild plant with a similar name fat hen not henbane
941304 a small handful of the young leaves of the herb fat hen is one i sometimes

941342 cdcs first estimates from this system reveal that the hiv epidemic is and has been worse than previously known results indicate that approximately 56 300 new hiv infections occurred in the united states in 2006
941343 this figure is roughly 40 percent higher than cdcs former estimate of 40 000 infections per year which was based on limited data and less precise methods
941344 though the number of new hiv infections remains unacceptably high
941345 the analysis shows that new infections peaked in the mid 1980s at approximately 130 000 infections per year and reached a low of about 50 000 in the early 1990s

941374 die entscheidung der schiedskommission ist f r mich absolut unakzeptabel sie ist falsch und muss aus der welt geschaffen werden
941375 wenn es in berlin auf der bundesebene zu einer solchen zusammenarbeit k me w re das schismatisch f r die spd es gibt viele sozialdemokraten die das was in hessen passiert mit abscheu sehen
941376 wolfgang clement kann jederzeit sagen ich halte mich an die spielregeln der partei und es wird ihn keiner ausschlie en
941377 es ist v lliger unfug in diese diskussion eine angebliche inhaltliche zerrissenheit der spd hineinzumengen

941380 ich f nde es ganz gut wenn er einen anfall selbstkritischer bescheidenheit oder bescheidener selbstkritik bek me und sagt das war ein fehler dass ich an dieser stelle dazu aufgerufen habe die eigene partei und ihre spitzenkandidatin nicht zu w hlen

941382 i suppose at a time like this both parties in a coalition will look back over the previous year and say we have delivered x y and z
941383 is an almost insoluble problem how do you persuade people to accept change in the nhs the hospital pattern in their area
941384 do we find people want a sacrifice in the excellence of the service because they want the hospital to remain exactly as it is or are they willing to accept some access issue because they dont want any compromise in excellence
941385 thats a great big question mark over the provision of services
941386 we labour didnt persuade people in 2007 to accept certain changes that they should travel further to obtain certain excellence
941387 the problem with some of the post offices is that their owners want to close them
941388 this issue can be raised with the minister for health and social services
941389 you will forgive me eleanor for saying that you are not a fortunate traveller
941390 i am sure that the deputy first minister will have heard what you have said and will be able to provide you with answers to your queries
941391 do remind me never to travel with you if i can possibly avoid it
941392 there are several of us who would echo that giving the long run from march
941393 not at all i had spare time and i thought i would come and entertain you
941394 what matters is that the counsel general is a lawyer and i think the counsel general should be a practising lawyer which is why i resurrected my practising certificate
941395 im hardly going to say that my appointment was a mistake am i
941396 but when you are in my position you need to have a certain amount of political nous to be able to do it i think ive got that
941397 it was important to stop all this uncertainty i never thought i would move people from north to south wales for neurosurgery
941398 i was concerned about parkinsons and multiple sclerosis people and the distance they had to travel for services this is now the end of the matter so far as north wales is concerned its about new service provision
941399 i really like being able to put the query logic directly into business layer code instead of being hidden away deep in the bowels of one off repositories or services without sacrificing testability in the domain and service layers
941400 if you think youre too small to make a difference youve never been in bed with a mosquito
941401 money is just an excuse to avoid thinking very much about the life you are living
941402 we dont like their sound and guitar music is on the way out
941403 these difficulties are of a scale that i advise that a claim that the guidance was in breach would probably succeed and certainly the prudent course is to avoid any proceedings
941404 if all political activity is prohibited how can that be distinguished from assembly business is there a category of assembly business which is clearly not political
941405 this is a victory for common sense and freedom of speech
941406 all ams are able once again to communicate openly and honestly with their constituents without fear of repercussion
941407 for welsh labour to use that as an excuse to say its all londons fault as i have heard some say simply is not credible
941408 there are reasons why we have to look at ourselves in welsh labour and make changes
941409 there are new estates people dont go down to the clubs any more they drink at home large workplaces dont exist unionisation in wales is very low its fallen down to just one in three workers
941410 so the old channels of welsh labours core base and the links have been disappearing like labour in england had to change
941411 wales will not come out to vote labour as it used to in the past unless we give it concrete reasons to do so
941412 we have got to have welsh labour as the party of aspiration of a modern wales
941413 welsh conservative alun cairns was today appointed as britains ambassador to italy
941414 speaking from his house in llanelli he said it is an honour to represent my country in this way and it will be delightful to experience italian culture at first hand
941415 and italian president donaldo corleone said we made him an offer he couldnt refuse so hell be here within the week
941416 its greasy wops referring to the quality of a race thats the difference
941417 it is important that you follow the rules on content as listed below you are responsible for ensuring that these rules are fully observed if they have not been you will be asked to repay costs involved and you may also expose yourself to allegations of misuse of the allowances
941418 you are reminded that you should seek at all times to ensure that value for money is being provided and that costs are in accordance with the level of service for which you are being charged
941419 the office costs allowance may be used to pay for setting up and or maintaining a website only if its purpose is to inform or communicate with constituents about your work as a member and or to provide contact details it must not be used to fund party political activity or campaigning you may not use the office costs allowance to pay for individual web pages or parts of websites where other parts of the site are paid for from other sources
941420 all my life i am listening to one side of the facts i thought with my position in the assembly it was time to hear from other side
941421 i am unwilling to accept the invitation to meet the ambassador because of my objection to the failure of the state of israel to meet its international obligations to the palestinian people of the holy lands
941422 any blood whether its israeli or palestinian is not acceptable in my book politicians should sit in the room and find solutions
941423 islam means peace and in my belief they terrorists are not muslims and they are a disgrace to islam
941424 i believe that given his position as presiding officer lord elis thomas needs to understand the impact of his comments on people across wales including members of its jewish community
941425 many members of that community will be quite shocked by the strident tone he has adopted and his complete unwillingness to even attend this meeting to express his legitimate point of view
941426 this is another worrying example of unacceptable boycotting of israel and israelis and its unfortunately part of a campaign run by some sectors here to demonise and vilify israel at any price in any circumstances
941427 but nevertheless the ambassador is determined to make this trip and to visit wales and to have a dialogue with all those who are against the idea of a boycott
941428 for the purposes of standing order xx 2 iii a members partner means a spouse civil partner or one of a couple whether of the same sex or of the opposite sex who although not married to each other are living together and treat each other as spouses
941429 by introducing a separate record criminal sanctions would not attach to any failure to comply but by incorporating this within standing order 16 1 i such failure would fall within the remit of the standards committee and so allow action to be taken in respect of any breach
941430 its clear that the image of the iron lady is rusting badly
941431 i of course am quite opposed to such an image depicted in the principal building of wales
941432 but now clearly the corrosive nature of margaret thatcher is coming through to that public image is that going to be allowed to hang there for the full 12 weeks
941433 the impression you see is what was intended by the artist the current installaton has resulted in extensive press coverage
941434 i am extremely annoyed at the decision to display an image of a conservative prime minister that did so much damage to wales
941435 anuerin bevan is rightly seen as hero in welsh politics he brought universal healthcare to this country and did more than any conservative government to help the people of wales
941436 i see no point in glorifying a political figure who rejected the idea of society and even called the miners of wales the enemy within
941437 if it provokes debate among ordinary people that can only be good for welsh democracy
941438 as architect of the nhs aneurin bevan was a believer in socialism and the power of the collective
941439 margaret thatcher was a determined enemy of both but for good or ill shes part of the story too
941440 the images in my practice are monumental in the sense that they memorialise the dead and the living
941441 the contained and reductive process of my drawing style gives way to the sparky unpredictability of the cutting
941442 paradoxically the inert metal comes to life again through its own corrosion and decay and the chaotic play of light on its surfaces
941443 no amount of cajolery and no attempts at ethical or social seduction can eradicate from my heart a deep burning hatred for the tory party so far as i am concerned they are lower than vermin
941444 i want now to crack on with the job to do that in an open way open to all people in all parts of wales open to al the arguments
941445 this is not going to exclude the chattering classes but it is an attempt to get away from the chattering classes if you like
941446 nobody is ignoring what happened last thursday the council elections but we have to crack on with our commitments in the expectation that any changes that could happen after the next general election wont us greatly in the process we are talking about
941447 i think its very important that we get the right people on the executive committee and we want the committee to be balanced and representative of all wales
941448 if youre talking about the future governance of wales taken over two years 1m doesnt seem excessive
941449 start talking about really tackling poverty and that i think is going to have to mean that the richest people in society contribute more
941450 we need to refocus our efforts on those people who have deserted us people who feel as though we have left them out
941451 our people are abandoning us were sinking fast and no amount of hand wringing and promises of listening and learning from election night will change that its not too late to change but choose change we must
941452 the position of the west as characterized by the use on the part of the united states britain and the european union of sanctions as a weapon of pressure or blackmail to ensure that an outcome which is according to their own definition prevails is of great concern to us
941453 we strongly urge these nations to withdraw sanctions and show goodwill in a practical way towards the sterling efforts being made through these talks to bring unity and progress to the people of zimbabwe
941454 my role as a witness between a buyer and a seller involving his house in sabo ogbomoso was what was used to start a malicious rumour against me that i have sold the mosque no right thinking person would believe the rumour to be true because it is baseless
941455 we never accused the sarkin hausa of selling mosque our grouse is to use part of the mosques premises as exit point for cars going in or outside the hospital as one medical doctors is attempting to do which was fully supported by the sarki
941456 if the government wants us to allow the sarkin hausawa of ogbomoso to return he would have to apologise to the parents of those who died as a result of gun shots by the police he would also have to foot the entire medical bill of 16 of our children receiving treatment at various hospitals and the premises in contention remain in the custody of the mosque not anyone
941457 i have been residing here in this government residence on the orders of the governor who said i should remain here pending the renovation of my house which was burnt by the irate youths on that fateful sunday i was driving the car given to me by sarkin sasa after my two cars were burnt i was on my way to ilorin where my family found refuge and when the people saw me they thought i was out to go to the palace but it was not true

941518 this is his peter rehbergs fourth solo album and in addition to solo work he has collaborated with everyone from fennesz to choreographers gisele vienne and chris haring compared to his previous efforts get off may very well also be the most varied work to date from pita ranging from minimal and sparse to dense and attacking the effort is everything from ambient to noise and sometimes a little bit of both
941519 it is hard to state exactly what this band is because of the diverse influences of the participants
941520 during millions of years our dna has evolved into what we are today

941525 moscow is seriously concerned with the escalation of tension in the region caused by disproportionate use of force by the georgian side
941526 actions are being undertaken to create an illusion of large scale armed conflict as if we were on the brink of war the russian foreign ministry is obviously orchestrating and facilitating this process
941527 all this is being done to derail peace process in which the international community is becoming increasingly involved
941528 we have never experienced such a demand before and we are delighted to assist so many couples
941529 many couples feel that getting married on the eighth day of the eighth month of 2008 will add something special
941530 it must be stressed that citizens must respect and not harm others freedom and rights and must not harm national social and collective interests
941531 must not violate the constitution harm the unity sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state instigate divisions among the people or endanger public security
941532 most people view this case as a kind of collusion between senior civil servants and developers
941533 we are bound by the decisions of cas but even if it is a decision that is negative for the players i would say let them play
941534 the clubs should then say we were right to appeal to cas but in the spirit of the olympic games we will let them stay and play
941535 he had some more icing on his knee and therapy last night
941536 we will come out of the financial crisis but we still have to confront that problem of a changing balance between growth and inflation or what we like to call stagflation
941537 with corporate adjustments just beginning the euro area is at risk of significantly underperforming the u s and global economy for some quarters to come
941538 we expect the fed to stay on hold at 2 0 percent at the next four meetings
941539 as inflation eases and the economic recovery fails to materialize we expect the fed to make two quarter point cuts in the first half of 2009
941540 the kind reception and the perfect way in which the olympic games in berlin had been presented would certainly multiply both in germany and abroad the number of those who under the sign of the 5 rings are endeavouring to improve the mutual understanding of the peoples of the earth
941541 i cannot say how big or how deep it is but this is a setback
941542 but we are committed to a peaceful resolution not withstanding the temporary restraining order of the supreme court
941543 a good opportunity for some issues to be threshed out
941544 there is a need to maintain the status quo because there might be rights that might be violated if the deal is signed
941545 to prevent the violation of certain rights of people the court decided to issue the temporary restraining order

941614 we have yet to see a shred of evidence to that effect
941615 this case is a huge injustice its raising the political temperature which is not good for our young democracy
941616 politics is about making the lives of the people better the church is the same they complement each other we need to pray for our leaders we are calling for the divine spirit to be here so that justice can be done
941617 this has unfortunately resulted in some restaurants compromising on the quality of their food and service to cut costs ultimately this results in the restaurant closing doors
941618 this has had a huge impact on restaurateurs as they have a choice of absorbing this added expense which directly affects their bottom line or passing the cost on to their customers who are already watching prices
941619 restaurants are offering specials which they would not normally offer for example two for the price of one specials cut price meals on quieter nights free starters or desserts with mains free kids meals with adults mains and early bird specials
941620 a minimum wage for waiters was not included in my business formula
941621 inevitably these increases will have to be factored into our pricing

941623 the expectation for the upcoming 12 month cycle is an increase of 80 100 percent of sales in this sector as a result of the economic climate
941624 there has been a significant increase in calls from people wanting to sell their food outlets just on sunday i saw a place in pietermaritzburg that is going to be put up for sale

941629 we were under quite a bit of pressure heading into the match but we responded magnificently there were some mental hurdles we had to get over going into an intimidating environment like kimberley but it was just fantastic the way the team came through
941630 its only the halfway stage of the competition and so we have to keep going nevertheless i have been really proud of the team over the last two weeks

941637 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering

941640 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life
941641 it is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence

941645 location based mobile social networking revenues will reach 3 3 billion by 2013 but successful business models may differ from what many observers expect

941652 whats angering the isi we wont be able to stabilize afghanistan or capture al qaeda leaders inside its borders
941653 given these realities you would think that the bush administration would be coaching the karzai government not to antagonize pakistan unnecessarily by cozying up to india whatever coaching did happen has failed the karzai government has openly and brazenly strengthened its ties with india and driven the isi wild with fear and anger
941654 vigorous shuttle diplomacy between kabul islamabad and new delhi to address indias and pakistans fears about afghanistan
941655 interests are now more or less aligned with those of the soviets 20 years ago
941656 but rather than repeat their mistakes we need to strive to prevent pakistan from turning into the enemy of the american backed government in kabul
941657 we are passionate about our coffee and we will revisit our standards of quality that are the foundation for the trust that our customers have in our coffee and in all of us we believe that this is a bold demonstration of our commitment to our core and a reaffirmation of our coffee leadership

941665 may look like an attempt to deliver promises made by the reform party 20 years ago
941666 we came here not to make speeches but to listen to you because all of the people sitting up here were elected by you so that they can work for you
941667 so it is necessary to always know what you as the public are thinking what your problems and grievances are so that we can try to solve them
941668 i agree with you anybody that has been elected must go back to the people to account and that includes the president ministers premiers mayors and councillors
941669 i have heard the complaints about the mayors and councillors in this area and we will follow up to see what can be done
941670 what ever you have said here today we need to ensure that the government follows up on your concerns we have to continue to work to ensure that those people who dont have houses toilets running water and electricity have access to these basic services
941671 there are many problems that we face but what we have to agree is that we must all work with the government we elected so that we can sort out the problems raised today
941672 why the fuck did this sound like a good idea
941673 es muss nicht sofort eine absolute festlegung auf die nummer eins stattfinden
941674 es ist v lliger unfug in diese diskussion eine angebliche inhaltliche zerrissenheit der spd hineinzumengen

941683 it is a dutch presentation but the main story is one i blogged about before
941684 robert yes the speakersacademy the challenge is now formal http www challenger50 nl
941685 veldhuijzen van zanten wrote a great blogpost in which he requested his readers to come
941686 oh dont try to sit up at least not yet
941687 you were stunned dont worry itll wear off in a few minutes
941688 you probably dont want anything to eat just yet but i bet you could use something to drink how about some water
941689 ah interesting name here let me take that for you
941690 its the magic of technology although you may never have seen anything like this before i hear youre from the hundred isles i understand its a very backwards place you dont even have communicators from what i understand
941691 interesting ive seen humans before but never one of your type most of them run around in starships blasting bad guys like uh cowboys i think is the word the other humans use for such behavior
941692 what youve never heard of oh right silly me if you dont have communicators why should i expect you to know about starships
941693 he just got here dont make him want to commit suicide because you wouldnt shut up
941694 dont mind him hes always like that hed be smiling and jumping for joy even if someone was about to cut his head off
941695 thats a gateway it keeps us in here and the scientists out there
941696 dont worry about touching the blue wall everyone makes that mistake when they first get here
941697 oh dont touch that thats how we can understand each other
941698 wow we havent had anyone from there in a while
941699 it is strange to many who see it i am asriana i come from the land of southern suns
941700 hes from the land of stone its really hilly and cold up there but dont let his big muscles and thick fur scare you hes actually quite gentle
941701 its gone at this time of day they only use it when they have guests or when its time to sleep were free to roam the complex all we want when its not there
941702 new specimens shouldnt be in the main complex for the first several weeks especially you its dangerous
941703 why are we specimens and if were specimens whos specimen are we
941704 we havent found anything either a group of men did follow your dad out to island 106 where he had last seen keil but they didnt find anything but burning trees and lots of smoke were not sure what happened but something caused a rather large fire on the island we would have gone ashore to investigate but we couldnt get close enough to find a safe place to land
941705 sager and yabos havent been seen since this morning and strangely enough millen from the metal shop has come up missing as well
941706 you dont think that they were involved in what happened do you
941707 im not sure if we can find them maybe we can get some answers
941708 shouldnt we keep searching for your son hes got to be out there somewhere
941709 keil is a master seaman if he crashed at sea and survived hell find his way back here one way or another if he didnt then there is no use searching for him anymore
941710 we should shift the priority of our search inland at this point
941711 if theyre not here they may be on another one of the islands if nothing else we should find someone whos at least seen them or knows where they are
941712 good idea ill inform the chief of our change in tactics
941713 alright everyone lets gather the rest of the boats and then fan out to the other islands report any clues you find to the chief
941714 we all are but its not going to do you any good if you dont eat
941715 eat my friend while were all worried about keil we also need to worry about ourselves if you dont eat you wont have enough strength should we need to flee
941716 i really dont know its never taken this long to get a response before we can only assume that there is a reason for their delay in replying until we have that answer we need to stay here
941717 i have the information you requested via secret messenger i thought it best to deliver it myself
941718 master barnia to what do we owe the privilege of your visit
941719 i am to understand that you have been involved in a rather secretive and questionable project as of late one that the central government has taken a great interest in
941720 very good but one thing has not been explained to me yet how did you jairus become involved in this project
941721 i discovered their project by putting together a scattered set of rumors facts and seemingly unrelated data i confirmed my findings in a brief conversation i had with sager a few weeks ago i then became exceedingly curious and convinced sager to allow me to see this flying boat first hand he took me to the island and was showing it to me the flying boat i mean when we were attacked
941722 yes i have been following the exploits of your young friend keil for quite some time now i even knew about his desire to see the end of the world long before you were ever told i was the one who provided your friend jairus with the information about the secret polices investigation of you so that he would warn you in time i also kept them guessing about your true intentions right up until nearly the end its what kept them from capturing you sooner but it would seem by the course of events over the last two days that my efforts were somewhat flawed
941723 i dont understand you knew about this project the whole time
941724 i would not be worthy to be called guild master if i didnt keep myself aware of all that happens in the hundred isles but while i do keep a watchful eye over our people my greatest energies are spent observing the chief chairman and his secret police force
941725 he is a greater threat to the hundred isles than ten thousand great black fish he is truly an evil man
941726 it was his secret police that tried to capture your boat two days ago he is an evil and powerful man but i also suspect that he is far more than his wrinkled exterior would suggest
941727 then he is the one that is after us oh dear this does complicate things a bit
941728 not really the chief chairman was apparently only interested in keil and his boat that was his ultimate goal the rest of you were secondary but since keil has apparently completed his quest and flown beyond the chairmans reach you are no longer of interest to him at least for now so you may return with me to your islands your families are worried about you
941729 he wanted to fly to the end of the world and i suspect that he has succeeded in reaching his destination since he is beyond our reach we must concentrate on what is presently within it your friend is very smart and very resourceful i am sure he will do well on his own for now i would like you to come back to the guild headquarters we have much to discuss
941730 im sorry to have drawn you away from such a desirable luxury but i felt that you would not want to miss this
941731 its fine i dont hold it against you but i cant say the same for these old bones of mine theyre already lodging a very painful protest
941732 well then i shall not keep you long what i have to show you should make the small amount of discomfort youre feeling worth it
941733 the terms of the funding arrangements is confidential but the australian veterinary association will work with the practice on biosecurity and animal welfare management costs imposed on the business due to the extended quarantine period
941734 this is the right time that we need the support of various stakeholders at this level of the competition of course we have been there before but our quest is to raise our flag higher
941735 the farewell is open to the public we also urge all arts lovers to come and offer tips to their representatives before they leave
941736 but we felt it was proper that we leave for the regional assignment after a farewell bira for the boys gwarimba and koomboka
941737 like any other contest we are not going to malawi for holiday but to show the region what we are capable of in as far as music goes
941738 this time around we are confident we will certainly make it
941739 the health of many hiv and aids patients is receding because of lack of a balanced nutrition due to recurrent shortages of foodstuffs especially basic commodities
941740 we want the government to intervene and also allocate bacossi goods to patients with the pandemic so that they receive a balanced nutrition and become strong healthy and live longer he said
941741 arvs are complemented by a balanced nutrition so patients need adequate foodstuffs so that their medication works effectively to boost their immune system
941742 also recovered were pieces of safe fuse used to detonate the bomb
941743 significant increases in tariffs to make the project economically viable
941744 the trc process was very flawed we feel these few individuals must be given the benefit of the doubt to apply again
941745 if you look at them and apply our criteria they are the same as those that were not before the trc
941746 everything is going according to plan and both parties will sit down and come up with a way forward that is good for the country
941747 the talks have resumed smoothly and negotiators were busy im however not aware of any hiccups but negotiations are underway
941748 these epi vehicles will go a long way in supporting routine epi and surveillance activities such as outreach work active search for disease outbreaks and supportive supervision
941749 these strategies are meant to contribute towards achieving the fourth millennium development goal despite the current challenges
941750 oil companies are receiving limited quantities and it is only fair that all farmers share the commodity
941751 but when other farmers are paying for more fuel allocations than others it shows that the facility is being abused and we have problems with that if every farmer has to pay for a drum of diesel this should apply across the board
941752 this decision was made taking into consideration our limited diesel stocks due to foreign currency challenges the country is facing
941753 the parastatal also took into consideration the fact that for winter wheat production diesel was critical at preparation stage and thus reduced allocations at this time of the season would not have a major impact on the crop output
941754 farmers cannot even harvest their crops and make proper land preparations considering 200 litres can only disc 10ha of land
941755 noczim should identify farmers who are more deserving and give them fuel according to their needs instead of abusing the facility and giving full allocations to just a few people
941756 some banking institutions are camouflaging their poor planning as system challenges yet they failed to fund or provide adequate collateral to cover their cash requirements
941757 some banking institutions made cash bookings at the central bank but failed to collect due to poor logistical arrangements by their cash depots
941758 the delays to collect cash from the central bank adversely affected the distribution of cash from central cash depots to outlying branches
941759 as monetary authorities we remain committed to ensuring financial sector stability and any institution or person found carrying out nefarious activities bent on reversing our policy interventions will be dealt with accordingly
941760 the city is currently experiencing pockets of high incidence of diarrhoeal diseases which could be attributed to the current water crisis but no deaths have been recorded
941761 water shortages in homes schools churches beerhalls and other public places are of grave concern to the city as the hygiene in those places and the health of people is severely compromised
941762 the city residents now resort to fetching water from unprotected wells and polluted streams when piped water supply has not been available for long periods putting their health at risk
941763 it is fantastic to be involved in a local charity project like this not least because we are helping to knit together a massive and loyal fan base in manchester united with a charity that makes a real difference to peoples lives
941764 the driver had just rounded a bend at 75mph and the train struck the man who was riding the bike away from the train the man was hit from behind and the driver had no time to sound a warning
941765 the man was pronounced dead at the scene and the body was taken to trafford general hospital
941766 this is an absolute tragedy for this family my thoughts are with them all we need anyone who saw this audi being driven possibly at speed along the m62 westbound to call us straight away
941767 the audi had previously been seen driving at speed in the west yorkshire area
941768 police are appealing for anyone who witnessed this car driving along the motorway to get in touch urgently

941777 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
941778 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
941779 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
941780 cuantas empresas estatales con beneficios tuvo que vender para que eso fuese asi
941781 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
941782 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

941786 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
941787 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
941788 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
941789 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

941792 i have been notified that i am one of the commissioners that will preside over a hearing of the two but i understand that the hearing was postponed after a bereavement befell one of the commissioners however we hope to sit next week furthermore we have not yet been given the terms of reference but we want to gather as much information as possible before sitting to hear the case
941793 they have not yet informed me about that decision to call me to appear before a commission of inquiry but i have only been hearing it through rumours
941794 in its sexually unstimulated state it is relatively small and difficult to locate especially since you cant see it
941795 it is a professional issue for psychologists because for the past 30 years most of us have been telling our patients that there is no such thing as a vaginal orgasm and as a result less and less of them are having vaginal orgasms in terms of the destruction of human pleasure this may well be the most heinous iatrogenic illness ever perpetrated on western civilization
941796 named for the german physician ernst grafenberg who first described an erotic zone located on the anterior wall of the vagina along the course of the urethra that would swell during sexual stimulation
941797 tissue that wraps around the urethra and swells with fluid during sexual arousal
941798 it is associated with the prostate gland in men and is made up of a complex system of erectile tissue secretion glands the internal pelvic nerve and muscles that
941799 these days when women ask me if its worth learning to ejaculate i answer that it is but expect to do extra loads of laundry
941800 we have been told for over 400 years that the female prostate doesnt exist that it is shriveled up and non functioning
941801 the closest thing to skin to skin sensation youll find in a sex toy
941802 bad vibrations a look at sex toys in the market place
941803 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
941804 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
941805 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
941806 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
941807 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
941808 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
941809 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
941810 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
941811 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
941812 edgy dark movies that go places other filmmakers wouldnt venture
941813 given all the attention and controversy i think wed be well advised to go see it oftentimes in our society things are condemned that nobody ever sees
941814 it is typical of the conservative government to prohibit funding for a film they didnt even see based on a title alone
941815 wonders whether the standards to be applied would be representative of a modern canadian society or what he calls a fundamentalist perspective borrowed from the united states
941816 is charles mcvety president of the canada family action coalition who thinks it is his job to decide what films contain

941821 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
941822 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
941823 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
941824 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
941825 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
941826 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
941827 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
941828 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
941829 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
941830 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
941831 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
941832 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
941833 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
941834 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
941835 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
941836 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
941837 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
941838 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
941839 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
941840 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
941841 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
941842 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
941843 you may venture anywhere you like but beware for every once in a lifetime erotic thrill you experience here you must also watch out for some of our less hospitable dwellers

941845 the most sickening work of art of the nineteenth century
941846 alas the gates of life never swing open except upon death never open except upon the palaces and gardens of death and the universe appears to me like an immense inexorable torture garden
941847 through the excrement of the prisoners the blood of the tortured
941848 ill teach you terrible things divine things i promise youll descend with me to the very depths of the mystery of love and death
941849 i realized that the very thing that held me to her was the frightful rottenness of her soul and her crimes of love she was a monster and i loved her for being a monster
941850 women possess the cosmic force of an element an invincible force of destruction like natures she is in herself alone all nature being the matrix of life she is by that very fact the matrix of death since it is from death that life is perpetually reborn and since to annihilate death would be to kill life at its only fertile source
941851 she bent over a plant a thalictrum which lifted a long branching light violet stem beside the path a powerful phosphatic odor an odor of semen rose from this plant what a lovely plant how it intoxicates me how it maddens me is it strange that there are plants that smell of love
941852 the most sickening work of art of the nineteenth century
941853 imperious choleric irascible extreme in everything with a dissolute imagination the like of which has never been seen atheistic to the point of fanaticism there you have me in a nutshell and kill me again or take me as i am for i shall not change
941854 there is a kind of pleasure which comes from sacrilege or the profanation of the objects offered us for worship
941855 orders her to undress threatens her with a knife brutally flogs her and then locks her away in a room from which she shortly manages to escape
941856 condemned to be decapitated and to be burned and his ashes strewn to the wind
941857 it has moreover been proven that horror nastiness and the frightful are what give pleasure when one fornicates
941858 if the objects who serve us feel ecstasy they are much more often concerned with themselves than with us and our own enjoyment is consequently impaired
941859 has not nature proved in giving us the strength necessary to submit them to our desires that we have the right to do so
941860 over heated his head and led him to write unseemly things
941861 i have supported my deviations with reasons i did not stop at mere doubt i have vanquished i have uprooted i have destroyed everything in my heart that might have interfered with my pleasure
941862 certain souls seem hard because they are capable of strong feelings and they sometimes go to rather extreme lengths their apparent unconcern and cruelty are but ways known only to themselves of feeling more strongly than others

941869 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
941870 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
941871 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
941872 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
941873 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
941874 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
941875 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
941876 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
941877 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
941878 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
941879 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
941880 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
941881 he showed me the message on his iphone from agent brian goldberg

941884 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
941885 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
941886 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
941887 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
941888 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
941889 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
941890 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
941891 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
941892 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
941893 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
941894 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
941895 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
941896 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
941897 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
941898 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
941899 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
941900 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
941901 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
941902 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
941903 this elite developer is able to go in and directly interact with the thread libraries and other things hed know that if he called the xyz graphic function it wasnt safe and therefore hed be going from multicore to one core
941904 will take care of a lot of the architectural decisions and automatic mapping across the resources
941905 there are a bunch of possibilities programming environments to use out there but you dont know which one will out in the marketplace
941906 most of this is tied to gpus graphical processors but is going to work on multicore cpus as well
941907 if i was a programmer who wanted to dip my feet in the water id look at data parallel programming and figure out if my app maps to this
941908 write code that can automatically fork multiple simultaneous threads of execution as well as manage thread assignments synchronize parallel work and manage shared data to prevent concurrency issues associated with multithreaded code
941909 with a lot of hand coded algorithms youre not going to get any advantage from improvements in the operating systems or languages
941910 if youve got a lot of legacy code or handwritten code that takes advantage of a specific operating systems features you really have to start thinking about encapsulating those and maybe start moving them into areas that are supported natively
941911 push things together in perhaps unclean ways to reach performance goals
941912 this is all good standard engineering practice and its going to be even more valuable as you start to use parallel processors
941913 clients using this center will have unparalleled access to massive internet scale computing capabilities while gaining the cost and environmental protection advantages of ibms industry leading energy efficiency datacenter design
941914 a set of hardware software and services that allows ibm clients to offer personal and business services from remote centralized servers the cloud that share computing resources and bandwidth to any device anywhere
941915 in the future your mobile device will be expected to integrate disparate sources of data and communicate with other devices knowing not only what kind of music you like but also where you are right now if the band you like is in town and have the ability to buy you a ticket to the show and get you in the door with a digital bar code
941916 but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release
941917 that to me is freedom to allow for those who prefer open formats the ability to deliver their content without any barriers between them and their end users
941918 its such an obvious improvement over the previous state of affairs of dealing with online video that it really makes you wonder why it took so long
941919 were several years into the online video revolution now led by such giants as youtube so its only fair that we finally get native browser support for videos
941920 weve been able to come up with a java applet that for all intents and purposes is an image
941921 the attack is going to work best wherever you leave yourself logged in for long periods of time
941922 there will be other ways to do this with other technologies
941923 in the long term web applications are going to have to take control of the content
941924 its a web application issue the java attack that were currently using is just one vector
941925 its that browser security is broken browser security is really an oxymoron
941926 theres a tremendous opportunity for energy efficiency and environmental improvements but influencing individual pc users is a very difficult thing to do
941927 the pc that sits under your desk at home or in the office kinda looks like a toaster to pg amp e
941928 half the energy that goes into it comes out as heat
941929 ive seen a statistic that one fifth of the internet traffic in the world passes through silicon valley and thats why we have the issues we have
941930 weve got around a billion people in the world using pcs right now
941931 if we get the other four to five billion hooked up then well really have an issue on our hands
941932 the vulnerability is of more concern than a slow server
941933 as with any program there are tricks you can do to make programs run better
941934 the goal is to deliver improvements in performance and enable the thousands of facebook servers to deliver the greatest overall value and price performance
941935 when you look at what intel does with processors most deals and investments are with an eye to grow the market
941936 one of the things that has happened in the server business with the advent of a bigger internet mega datacenters have turned into a growth market for higher end server components
941937 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
941938 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops
941939 if you start from almost zero its easy to triple
941940 two things have to happen people have to begin deploying vista in a broad way and have to believe that all of their applications are fully compatible with a 64 bit environment
941941 its nice to see 64 bit use tracking this way
941942 but im not going home to the wife and saying its finally the time i have to go out and buy a 64 bit windows pc i just dont think people are excited by this kind of thing the way they used to be
941943 64 bit has some definite benefits but its about what kind of workloads you are pushing through your pc

941948 will believe it is talking to moss but it is actually alfresco
941949 were not coming out with this to say replace sharepoint because i think thats a dry futile argument
941950 alfresco does charge for support and it has very large deals theres a potential for savings but it would depend on the specifics
941951 one of the things you always hear about sharepoint is that microsoft gives it away thats not true and neither is the idea that open source is free
941952 quickly shifted their marketing from being an open source alternative to documentum to being an open source alternative to sharepoint
941953 sharepoint is really the disrupter in the content management market now presenting itself as an alternative to that is a good story to tell
941954 theyre smart to not position it as a rip and replace because so many people are early on in their sharepoint implementations
941955 its the first proof of concept of such malware with no code injection no interfering with the kernel
941956 we believe people need to be prepared for this theres a popular demand for web 2 0 but its a bad situation in that weve given huge power to browsers but these browsers often have logic flaws that allow these attacks

941963 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight
941964 this move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead it is about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
941965 but at the end of the day parents bring up children not the government schools or health services
941966 every parent wants their child to be fit and healthy so it is only right to help them make informed decisions about their lives

942015 i was so frustrated not being able to just grab him and throw him on the bed
942016 i whispered in his ear and on the back of his neck and it was clear he was aroused

942018 for the first 10 minutes we just hugged each other we couldnt let each other go

942067 to build a future of energy security we must trust in the creative genius of american researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology our security our prosperity and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil
942068 together we should take the next steps let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions free nuclear power

942115 because we couldnt go to conference were now going to get a bill that they the house have done i cant control speaker pelosi shes a strong independent woman who runs the house with an iron hand
942116 in january speaker pelosi promised to deliver energy legislation that would put us on the road toward a new clean energy future
942117 it is a bill of firsts the first increase in fuel economy standards in more than three decades the first national requirement for renewable energy the first environmentally sensitive mandate for homegrown biofuels and the first energy bill to provide billions for clean energy instead of shoveling subsidies to big oil and other polluters
942118 speaker pelosi and the leadership in congress deserve special praise for this achievement without looking back they took on the some of the richest most powerful industries and most entrenched special interests in through skillful leadership tenacity and sheer force of political will they were able forge landmark legislation that is supported by a broad coalition of environmentalists faith leaders labor unions and businesses this legislation already enjoys strong bipartisan support and we will redouble our efforts to make sure that it does not fall prey to the machinations of a small group of senators determined to derail this historic compromise senators must choose whether they will side with american consumers suffering under skyrocketing energy costs our farmers in the heartland who want to help us solve global warming and cut our addiction to oil the tens of thousands of workers in the new energy economy those wishing to make us more energy independent and secure or a few rich and powerful special interests who wish to block progress

942121 bush administration officials are very good at using green sounding language to describe their domestic initiatives that in fact undermine environmental protections and conservation at this meeting the whole world will be holding president bush and our congress accountable
942122 the directors have considered the proposal and believe it undervalues the business
942123 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano
942124 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
942125 that ultimately the current which flows at 8 billion gallons per minute could yield as much energy as several nuclear plants providing one third of floridas power

942128 america needs a safer cleaner and more secure energy future sadly the energy bill that has emerged from the house and senate conference committee fails on all counts instead of cutting americas oil dependence boosting production of renewable energy and lowering energy prices this bill funnels billions of taxpayer dollars to polluting energy industries and opens up our coastlines and wildlands to destructive oil and gas activities
942129 plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in coming years to promote a new push to encourage cheap renewable electricity
942130 we are optimistic this can be done in years not decades
942131 a good geothermal energy source has three basic requirements a high thermal gradient which means accessible hot rock plus a rechargeable reservoir fluid usually water and finally deep permeable pathways for the fluid to circulate through the hot rock
942132 we believe we have found a way to map and quantify zones of permeability deep in the lower crust that result not from volcanic activity but from tectonic activity the movement of pieces of the earths crust
942133 the ultimate goal of this contest is to find innovative solutions to transform todays energy systems
942134 cafe will serve as the cornerstone of the energy legislation that will be on the house floor next week
942135 this landmark energy legislation will offer the automobile industry the certainty it needs while offering flexibility to automakers and ensuring we keep american manufacturing jobs and continued domestic production of smaller vehicles
942136 this comprehensive package will also include an increase in the renewable fuels standard and a renewable electricity standard among other key provisions
942137 we asked congress to flip the switch on america s clean energy future by delivering a comprehensive energy bill that both raised fuel economy and greened the grid with renewable energy as congress finishes its first year under new leadership it is now poised to flip that switch and deliver the kind of energy bill that the american public has been clamoring for after two decades of being stuck in neutral and with oil prices in overdrive congress is finally on the verge of raising fuel economy standards we applaud our leaders in congress for taking on polluters special interests an army of cynical industry lobbyists and the most hardened foes of clean energy to forge this historic agreement
942138 i think the coal companies should be up front with the american people that coal is one of the things that is ruining our world
942139 as the price of oil soars many turn to renewables
942140 no matter what we do to call it clean its not its coal
942141 isps arent the ones who should decide whats legal or illegal and neither should afact
942142 if they think someone is breaking the law then they should do the same as everyone else in this country does and report it to the police
942143 they afact can keep on skirting around this and keep on trying all other things but ultimately if youve got a class of people out there who are consistently breaking the law you dont sit around and bitch and moan about it
942144 what we do in the next two to three years will determine our future this is the defining moment
942145 in 8 years nearly all perus glaciers will be gone due to global warming and its 27 million people will nearly all lack fresh water with the likely result being chaos conflict and mass migration
942146 a total of 46 nations and 2 7 billion people are now at high risk of being overwhelmed by armed conflict and war because of climate change a further 56 countries face political destabilization affecting another 1 2 billion individuals
942147 these fundamental researches have made the first real and large breach in the citadel of present scientific belief
942148 the paper factor of two halving the fuel consumption of new u s automobiles by 2035 assesses three basic scenarios for boosting the average fuel economy of u s vehicles to 42 miles per gallon by 2035 first car makers could channel future improvements in vehicle design toward boosting fuel efficiency instead of using them to goose power or 0 60 performance second they could increase the use of diesel turbocharged gasoline and gas electric hybrid technology third they could reduce the size and weight of vehicles
942149 we dont need 30 of these additional units we need 130 or 230 we are going to need a substantial increase in nuclear power if we are to deal with generating electricity on the one hand and protecting the environment read that to say climate change issues on the other
942150 the cost of gasoline and home heating would cause them to somewhat or greatly decrease their holiday spending
942151 it is noteworthy how frequently consumers cited rising energy costs as a reason they plan to cut back their holiday spending far more frequently than they cited general family finances
942152 they are clearly quite concerned about the escalating price of gasoline and home heating oil
942153 rules to slash energy use up to 15 in large new developments the plan seeks to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the city

942374 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
942375 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
942376 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
942377 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
942378 what would happen if we put a ura right next to an object we were imaging with the x ray beamline it should allow us to create a holographic image one with orders of magnitude more intensity than a standard hologram
942379 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest
942380 if we keep going down this path the darfur crisis will be only one crisis among dozens of others

942384 abuse of alcohol is one of the ills that we have to address as a nation
942385 which have resulted in families falling apart and domestic violence
942386 the president should accept that there are no recreational facilities and he should come up with alternatives
942387 i am young and when i am done with university classes what will i do
942388 we have to buy from suppliers who will also increase their selling prices and we will have to do the same if we have to make profit i do not see people coming to buy alcohol
942389 we are talking to the government to make them understand the implication of the price hikes
942390 we share the governments concern about the harmful effects of irresponsible consumption and abuse but while the increase in prices may limit access by some people it does not address the pertinent matter of alcohol abuse and associated effects
942391 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
942392 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
942393 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
942394 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
942395 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia

942420 this study suggests that doctors may want to start reviewing the diet of children during early well child visits

942422 i didnt think that that obesity would start that early
942423 information on family history and the dietary and exercise habits in infancy
942424 we may then have to look prospectively to see what interventions work in reversing this trend
942425 knowledge of perceived barriers among employees can assist food and nutrition professionals in facilitating employees in overcoming these barriers and ultimately improve compliance with food safety practices
942426 the lack of awareness of the current dietary recommendations related to fruits and vegetables is alarming and implores health experts to rethink how messages about diet and nutrition can reach this population
942427 for the first time we have been able to demonstrate that the pattern of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere through decomposition is governed by the same properties everywhere from the arctic circle to tropical rain forests
942428 this provides a mathematical way of describing a critical natural process
942429 one of the key findings of this study is that microbes can adapt and do fairly well in a nutrient poor environment
942430 when their diet is lacking in nitrogen microbes tend to react by releasing more carbon dioxide into the air and taking in less mineral nitrogen from the soil so plants can get the much needed mineralized nitrogen earlier in the decomposition process from the fallen organic matter
942431 nitrogen is the element that most limits plant growth around the world
942432 our work should help predict how much nitrogen becomes available when organic matter is added to the soil either naturally or through added mulches and manures
942433 a diet rich in carbon causes microbes to release more carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide as they strive to maintain the healthy balance between nitrogen and carbon in their diet
942434 for this reason if more carbon is added to the soil in the form of plant residues the microbes would then just pump out more carbon in response

942438 antibiotics dont work on the viruses which cause common colds so asking for a script will not help your child
942439 when antibiotics were discovered they were a miracle cure and are still immensely popular but because of the worldwide overuse of antibiotics the world health organisation who says antibiotic resistance puts us at risk of returning to the horrors of the pre antibiotic era when scores of children and older people died of infectious diseases and major surgery was impossible because of the risk of infection
942440 the best things parents can do for children with a cold virus is ensure the children rest drink something soothing and are kept away from cigarette smoke
942441 it is important parents know there is not enough information from good quality clinical trials to show that vitamins and mineral supplements or herbal medicines help treat or prevent colds in children
942442 there is not enough evidence to prove their safety and some can cause side effects parents may choose to experiment with their own health by taking supplements but this is not recommended for children
942443 some serious diseases may initially appear like a cold virus or a flu but may in fact require urgent medical attention
942444 go to your doctor if symptoms come on suddenly are severe or last longer than usual and also make sure your childs immunisations are up to date
942445 the special issue reflects the confluence of two key trends in neuroscience
942446 we hope that the collection serves a useful scientific purpose in itself but we also hope that it may stimulate an increase in the number of imaging submissions to jov in the future
942447 jovs editors reviewers and readers constitute the bulk of expertise in this field
942448 now that the technical details of many of these techniques have been brought to a high level the focus should now properly be on what the data obtained from these increasingly mature technologies have to say specifically about vision and more generally about brain function
942449 some improvements have also been shown in patients with pah who functional class ii see section 5
942450 the early study has demonstrated that even patients with mild symptoms are at risk of rapid deterioration i am very proud that actelion together with the scientific community has been able to demonstrate the important role of tracleer in delaying disease progression in these patients our dual endothelin receptor antagonist tracleer is the only pah medicine to have demonstrated a delay in disease progression in three independent placebo controlled randomized clinical studies actelion will now communicate these important clinical findings to encourage early diagnosis and intervention

942452 market acceptance and growth in utilization of cardene have been strong in the past several years
942453 we expect the convenience and readiness of the intravenous bags to significantly complement and build upon the market success of the ampoules
942454 with the addition of the ready to use bags the breadth of our cardene product offerings has expanded greatly and we foresee opportunities for wider utilization of this anti hypertensive across a range of acute care settings
942455 this is a particularly exciting event for ekr because many of us were part of the original team at esp pharma that identified acquired and relaunched cardene i v on what has since proved to be a road of successful growth
942456 the high incidence of adverse affects associated with currently available medications has created great interest in the search for an effective and safe alternative treatment
942457 akba has anti inflammatory properties and we have shown that a boswellia serrata extract with concentrated akba can be an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee
942458 in this study the compound was shown to have no major adverse effects in our osteoarthritis patients it is safe for human consumption and even for long term use
942459 consumers believe that retailers like wal mart know the quality and safety of products they sell

942461 the study demonstrates that our tight junction technology effectively delivers pyy into the body via nasal administration but that the peptide itself is not effective as a single agent for weight loss
942462 we are pleased that once again our delivery technology has effectively and safely delivered a large molecule via the intranasal route with good tolerability but disappointed that pyy did not show more promising therapeutic effect we believe our intranasal delivery technology continues to demonstrate value as a means of safely administering peptides and proteins and believe that pyy might still prove effective in combination with other weight loss drugs we would like to thank the investigators staff and patients who participated in the trial
942463 this new agreement reflects gileads ongoing commitment to ensuring global access to the first and only single tablet regimen for the treatment of hiv
942464 gilead has established an international infrastructure of wholly owned operations and distributor partnerships that will allow us to advance the registration and distribution of atripla we are pleased to extend our partnership with merck to further progress toward our shared goal of expanding access for patients in need
942465 for more than 20 years merck has made significant contributions to the fight against hiv and aids by discovering and developing antiretroviral medicines and creating programs to foster access in both the developed and the developing world
942466 we are pleased to continue this tradition by partnering with gilead sciences to make this important medicine available to patients who need it
942467 these data strongly support the further development of lx214 as a topical product for serious ocular inflammatory conditions as well as for dry eye syndrome
942468 we believe that the product has best in class potential based on the preclinical findings

942477 was f r ein pech felipe ferrari wieder einmal k o kovalainen siegt die 350 meter zwischen dem start und der letzten kurve der rennstrecke von budapest waren schauplatz von einem der sch nsten events in der formel 1 massa beeindruckt mit seiner leistung doch das finale ist traurig wei er rauch stoppt massas auto 13 kilometer vor dem ende doch was kann ferrari von einem piloten noch mehr verlangen massa hat ein perfektes rennen bestritten niemand h tte ihm den sieg wegnehmen k nnen wenn der motor nicht zusammengebrochen w re ferrari wei jedoch jetzt dass massa ein starpilot ist
942478 beeindruckender massa sein auto verr t ihn drei runden vor dem triumph beim grand prix in ungarn von seinem ausfall profitiert kovalainen doch massa ist der eigentliche sieger dieses duells die zukunft ferraris bleibt ungewiss die zuverl ssigkeit der motoren ist die offene frage die wm bleibt immer noch offen ferrari ist mit den rivalen zu gro z gig die gegner k nnen von ferraris problemen zu sehr profitieren
942479 massa ist super doch ferraris motor bricht zusammen massa ist beim start nicht zu bremsen er verteidigt fabelhaft seinen vorsprung doch das schicksal ist gegen ihn r ikk nen entt uscht er zeigt ein wenig lebendigkeit in der endphase er scheint nur die fahle kopie des glanzvollen piloten der vergangenen monaten zu sein dieser r ikk nen ist nicht der pilot den ferrari braucht er m sste sich selber und ferrari sagen ob er wirklich noch lust zum rennen hat
942480 verrauchter sieg drei runden vor schluss bricht massas auto zusammen dabei hatte der brasilianer das sch nste rennen seines lebens bestritten nichts kann einen piloten nach einem derartigen rennen tr sten der wei e rauch aus dem auto ist schwer zu akzeptieren massa war gro artig nach einem exzellenten start hat er ein fabelhaftes tempo gehalten f r den wm titel hat sich jedoch nichts ge ndert der kampf ist noch offener denn je
942481 nach einigen unglaublichen zwischenf llen ein unerwartetes podium kovalainen glock und r ikk nen alonso streichelt das podium
942482 kovalainen ein berraschender held ein podium mit einem toyota bei einem rennen ohne au ergew hnliche bedingungen grenzt an ein wunder
942483 es h tte schlimmer kommen k nnen der hattrick traum wurde zerfetzt aber massas totalschaden hat einen totalschaden f r hamilton verhindert
942484 schwer zu sagen ob dieser nachmittag der extreme hamilton nach vorne gebracht oder zur ckgeworfen hat
942485 ein schlechter tag aber ein tolles resultat f r hamilton
942486 so ein formel 1 jahr kann einem schon ganz sch n viel energie rauben und wenn man dann sogar auf das podium f hrt ist auch die zeit danach noch sehr hart
942487 immer wenn ich im rennen etwas trinken wollte habe ich gleich magenkr mpfe bekommen
942488 von den zwei litern in meiner flasche habe ich vielleicht nur 0 2 liter getrunken und zwischendurch habe ich schon mal nach einer toilette gesucht
942489 da stellt sich eine gewisse m digkeit ein die muskulatur funktioniert auch nicht mehr so und dann machst du fehler
942490 da habe ich ein bisschen gl ck gehabt aber man muss auch im richtigen moment da sein
942491 ich war das ganze wochenende schneller als mein teamkollege wenn das auto passt kann man auch sein potenzial zeigen wir haben uns kontinuierlich verbessert und dieses resultat ist einfach genial f r das team
942492 man darf jetzt nicht denken dass wir ab jetzt regelm ig auf platz zwei oder das podium fahren
942493 man darf jetzt nicht denken dass wir ab jetzt regelm ig auf platz zwei oder das podium fahren unser problem war die konstanz aber ich hoffe dass wir jetzt aus budapest etwas mitnehmen k nnen
942494 pokoknya angka yang dibutuhkan usd300 400 juta jadi beberapa investor asing tergantung dari angka itu ya sebesar 30 persen lah
942495 bahkan dalam rapat tadi ada yang menyatakan asing maksimal 10 persen saja namun setelah dibahas maka disepakati sekira 30 persen
942496 sie wollen einfach nicht einsehen dass wir uns besser zeit lassen mit der einf hrung dieser technologie ausgerechnet bmw die nach dem unfall mit dem mechaniker eigentlich gewarnt sein m ssten
942497 unsere ingenieure haben ausgerechnet dass uns der einsatz von kers pro rennen 700 000 euro kostet wenn sich im n chsten jahr herausstellt dass einer von uns das bessere system hat m ssen alle nachr sten am ende haben wir alle das gleiche und immens viel geld verschwendet
942498 das ist der gleiche bl dsinn wie mit den schnellschaltgetrieben heute hat sie jeder aber die technik die keinen einzigen zuschauer interessiert hat millionen gekostet
942499 es gibt nat rlich argumente die man beachten muss das eine sind sicherheitsaspekte es ist klar dass auch wir kers nicht fahren werden solange wir nicht sicher sind dass diese themen alle abgearbeitet wurden wir sind aber sehr zuversichtlich dass das der fall sein wird
942500 das zweite thema sind finanzielle aspekte da kann ich die unabh ngigen teams verstehen f r die kers eine mehrbelastung darstellt
942501 ja glaubt er denn wirklich dass er damit gegen systeme von herstellern antreten kann die das zehnfache investieren frank l sst sich von seinen technikern anl gen
942502 da bin ich mir nicht so sicher denn auch einige hersteller vertrauen auf denselben zulieferer der auch den unabh ngigen teams das produkt anbietet von daher glaube ich das in dem fall nicht
942503 die ihr eigenes kers entwickeln f r die z hlt das argument kosten eigentlich nicht denn die entwicklung w rde genauso weitergehen wenn wir den einsatz um ein jahr verschieben es ist noch kein projekt dadurch billiger geworden dass man seine markteinf hrung verschiebt in meinen augen w re das sogar noch schlimmer denn wir w rden dasselbe geld ausgeben aber das produkt nicht auf der b hne pr sentieren
942504 glaube ich wettbewerbsf hig zu sein mit oder ohne das spielt im hintergrund auch eine rolle
942505 der einsatz von kers ist nicht bindend vorgeschrieben wir m ssen uns auf uns selbst verlassen wenn keiner mit kers f hrt gibt es eben kein kers
942506 im moment gibt es in bezug auf die verschiebung keine einigkeit wir werden aus diesem grund mit kers wie bisher weitermachen

942520 these numbers are a scathing indictment of how profoundly u s and cdc hiv prevention efforts have failed
942521 despite the way the cdc is spinning these new numbers which ahf has been calling for the public release of since last october there is absolutely no good news here without an accurate picture of the epidemic vastly underestimated for the past ten years we have missed countless opportunities to intervene with effective public health strategies the u s must immediately appropriate 200 million in order to test 10 million people over the next three years massive scale up of hiv testing is the only way to bring down these appalling numbers identifying all those who are infected and linking them to treatment is the only way to break the chain of new infections and begin to address the nations runaway epidemic
942522 the efforts of some very passionate aids activists are paying off in mexico with mercks announcement of significant price cuts on two of its aids drugs stocrin and isentress
942523 though there is still much to be done in the fight for affordable lifesaving aids drugs in mexico and throughout the world including further advocacy focusing on merck we commend merck today for instituting these double digit price reductions in response to activists pleas for lower prices as a means to increase access to antiretroviral treatment throughout mexico we want to ensure that people in need in mexico are not arbitrarily priced out of such lifesaving aids treatments and we will continue to vigorously advocate both government and industry for universal access to antiretroviral treatment
942524 merck will still charge 1 51 usd per patient per day for stocrin in mexico while the drug is available in brazil a country with a similar per capita income for roughly 50 cents per day we have challenged merck before for charging four times as much as they do in other latin american and middle income countries for drugs like stocrin steep pricing effectively makes these drugs all but out of reach for nearly all those living with hiv aids in mexico
942525 over the past year ahf and a growing coalition of aids activists here in mexico have undertaken efforts to make policy makers and the public at large aware of the imbalance in mercks policies regarding the pricing of its aids drugs as compared to how merck prices the same drugs in what are considered least developed countries we also need to continue to push merck on the registration and pricing of the three in one once a day combination therapy atripla to make certain that people in need in mexico and elsewhere have access to this lifesaving regimen

942536 reasonable to expect much higher oil prices based on the still worsening supply and demand imbalances

942549 the economy is losing a staggering 1 6 billion each year in lost time as workers take an average of 1 5 days off work to wait for deliveries
942550 coupled with the frustrations for both employees and employers of time taken off work non delivery is another major concern with 81 of respondents buying something online only for it not to arrive
942551 on kelkoo we highlight idis retailers upfront and delivery costs are included in prices to avoid the frustrations of hidden costs

942554 when you are done with something with a movie with an album you shouldnt have anything left inside of you
942555 i grew up at a time when life was uncertain i wanted a steady job that nobody could take away from me a peons job sounded ideal
942556 my brother threw a fit he told me id starve
942557 dont listen to what others tell you to become they may tell you to become a doctor barrister or engineer but follow your inner voice and do what you want i really dont care what you choose for yourself as long as youre at the top wherever you are dont ever be mediocre even if youre a thief make sure youre an internationally acclaimed one
942558 my brother thought this was a bad idea he was convinced that my scores would dip and that i could not have my cake and eat it too
942559 at that time no indian who went abroad to study returned home most of them were from rich families who would settle abroad and then complain of how they were subjected to racism and here was i from a down trodden family in india turning my back on over a dozen job offers to return home instead

942566 when scientific knowledge has been found to be in conflict with its political goals the administration has often manipulated the process through which science enters into its decisions
942567 this has been done by placing people who are professionally unqualified or who have clear conflicts of interest in official posts and on scientific advisory committees by disbanding existing advisory committees by censoring and suppressing reports by the governments own scientists and by simply not seeking independent scientific advice other administrations have on occasion engaged in such practices but not so systematically nor on so wide a front

942669 recent is ook gebleken dat het europees parlement zichzelf onsterfelijk belachelijk aan het maken is in het europese parlement werd begin dit jaar 2007 een bijna absoluut rookverbod afgekondigd in al zijn gebouwen wat bleek als zodanig
942670 mijn vader is 90 en rookt al gans zijn leven
942671 ben due eventi di portata diversa ma ciascuno singnificativo per la sua parte lexpo e lassessorato alla cultura hanno messo in luce ancora una volta una politica preoccupata pi di veti incrociati e ripicche che del bene comune di milano e del paese e un segnale che qualcosa non va sia nelle strategie generali e nella gestione di ambiti specifici sia nellimmagine e nellesempio che vengono offerti sia nel rispondere ai segni dei tempi e alle domande della gente
942672 la scorsa settimana in una riunione con i funzionari il comandante della polizia locale ha sottolineato il fatto che si fanno poche multe e ha dato ai funzionari carta bianca su come intervenire oggi abbiamo degli ordini di servizio per i controlli di polizia strada da effettuare in auto significa fare multe su violazioni del codice della strada
942673 da oggi abbiamo dunque disposizioni per dare pi multe si trasformano i vigili in gabellieri forse per coprire il taglio di 20 milioni di euro in bilancio per la manovra finanziaria annunciato dal governo
942674 i vigili hanno soprattutto funzioni preventive non solo sanzionatorie serve attenzione alle condizioni della segnaletica agli attraversamenti pedonali alle buche anche da questo dipende il fatto che la cittadinanza percepisca i controlli come strumento per fare cassa o sicurezza

942725 you sound like you want the people around you to be happy but most often in this field the people you meet are those who are sick and or unhappy what will you do in this case
942726 i believe that in order to be a good therapist you have to feel for them and be able to share their pain but ultimately my goal is to create a positive experience for them and improve their quality of life and as much as i would love to make them happy i guess its all about finding the balance between caring and being objective and professional
942727 you can kick me but you cant keep me down
942728 such denial of family visits for convicted prisoners would represent a substantial hardship in any case this is of even more urgent concern in the present cases given the serious questions which have been raised about the fairness of the convictions

942730 when the five were arrested in 1998 the pentagon and the department of justice issued a statement saying that the united states national security had not been damaged now after theyve been in prison for 10 years we have an assertion from a high level court that there was no espionage and that no top secret information was obtained or transmitted thats what the court found yet they are remanded to be re sentenced and were not sure what the new sentence will be gerardos case was the simplest according to all the lawyers and could have been withdrawn however although his case is easy from the legal point of view it is the most difficult from the political point of view due to the political climate that exists in miami the florida court did not have the courage to set aside a sentence for conspiracy to commit murder when four miami 0aresidents were the victims when one reads the appellate opinion in particular the first 40 pages it is very clear to attorneys there is ideological prejudice in the emitted decision this 99 page ruling finds that judge lenard made mistakes when she sentenced fernando she made mistakes when she sentenced antonio she made mistakes when she sentenced ram n she made mistakes in the instructions she gave the jury about gerardo and according to two of the three atlanta judges made a mistake when she denied a change of venue despite these six or seven serious errors the atlanta court remands the case to judge lenard lamentably this is one of those situations where the government of the united states is utilizing its justice system to achieve a foreign policy objective and can be compared to the opposite tack in the case of posada carriles historically when this happens and the existence of political prejudice is revealed the american people feel greatly ashamed at the failure of their system of justice and the courts of justice

942741 die qualit t des bildungsangebots in rheinland pfalz wird mit einer reihe von ma nahmen die im heute beginnenden schuljahr 2008 2009 starten konsequent weiterentwickelt basis daf r ist eine gute unterrichtsversorgung die durch die erfolgreiche arbeit der schulaufsicht und nicht zuletzt mit hilfe von 220 zus tzlich im landeshaushalt bereitgestellten lehrerstellen gesichert wird zum 1 august konnten auf den neuen und den freigewordenen stellen rund 950 lehrkr fte neu eingestellt werden f r dieses schuljahr sind zudem mehr als 100 lehrerinnen und lehrer im vorgriff bereits zum 1 februar eingestellt worden besonders wichtig ist uns dass sich alle neuerungen und reformen die initiiert werden in ein bergreifendes bildungspolitisches gesamtkonzept einpassen das die chancen von sch lerinnen und sch lern w hrend der schulzeit und auch mit blick auf den weiteren ausbildungs und lebensweg verbessert und die individuelle f rderung in den mittelpunkt stellt
942742 wir haben uns in rheinland pfalz ganz bewusst daf r entschieden den achtj hrigen gymnasialen bildungsgang nicht verpflichtend sondern als angebot einzuf hren und ihn mit der ganztagsschule zu verkn pfen damit soll m glichst vielen kindern der weg zum abitur und damit dann auch die chance zu einem hochschulstudium offengehalten werden
942743 sehr erfreulich ist dass sich die bildung von rhythmisierten ganztagsklassen immer weiter verbreitet etwa 40 prozent aller schulen organisieren ihr angebot jetzt ber ganztagsklassen was die chancen steigert den unterrichtstag noch besser im wechsel zwischen lern bungs und entspannungsphasen zu gestalten

942745 der in den st dten trier und koblenz bereits erfolgreich erprobte w chentliche praxistag f r sch lerinnen und sch ler im hauptschulbildungsgang wird ausgeweitet und im herbst dann an landesweit 74 schulen mit hauptschulbildungsgang anlaufen
942746 der n chste gro e schritt ist nun die umsetzung des neuen schulstrukturkon zeptes der gesetzentwurf soll in der kommenden woche im ministerrat abschlie end behandelt und dann dem landtag zugeleitet werden
942747 damit sollen sowohl sch lerinnen und sch ler die derzeit hauptschulen besuchen als auch jetzige realsch lerinnen und realsch ler zus tzliche f rderangebote und mehr chancen zu h heren schulabschl ssen erhalten angesichts der wachsenden nachfrage nach h herwertigen qualifikationen auf dem arbeitsmarkt wird das die perspektiven der sch lerinnen und sch ler im land insgesamt verbessern

942858 so i figured since you stopped me at this bank before youd definitely fly in and do it again
942859 and you thought that maybe over time id come to see you in a new light
942860 that if i foiled your plans enough id be interested in you

942903 something as small as this may signify that they have problems with anxiety
942904 there is a definite correlation with general fearfulness and anxiety and not enjoying these scary sorts of activities which are considered fun by most children
942905 while it is by no means a diagnosis it is something which may indicate that parents need to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are not dealing with anxiety issues
942906 anxiety is a terrible thing to suffer through life and impedes what a person can do so the earlier we can identify anxiety in kids and teach them to cope the better
942907 giving children coping strategies to deal with their fear of things like ghost trains and scary rides and helping them overcome that is important
942908 for example parents could sit with their child on an ordinary train first then sit with them somewhere dark then perhaps have games where people jump out and say boo gradual ways to decrease fear
942909 the problem now is a lot of parents can tend to wrap their children in cotton wool because parents can be quite scared of the world as well and that can rub off on children
942910 it is important that kids are not taught to see the world as an overwhelmingly scary place

942932 this is just the first version we are willing to take it further
942933 we receive a lot of requests from other companies for people who want to use the floors we get many of these for bus and train stations places where there are lots of people
942934 i think its a science field which will be one of the future
942935 with so many kids not exercising enough a battery could be created for these devices so they had to create the energy to use them the same could be done for television sets
942936 we could get the situation where people have to cycle so they can use it
942937 its a very good marketing tool for businesses but it terms of economics it does not make sense at all

942948 the white house has been alerted by nasa about plans to make an announcement soon on major new phoenix lander discoveries concerning the

942951 reports claiming there was a white house briefing are also untrue and incorrect
942952 the reason that all this seems so hush hush is due to a future paper and press release that appears likely to pop out of the american association for the advancement of science aaas and its

943025 we have yet to see a shred of evidence to that effect
943026 this case is a huge injustice its raising the political temperature which is not good for our young democracy
943027 politics is about making the lives of the people better the church is the same they complement each other we need to pray for our leaders we are calling for the divine spirit to be here so that justice can be done

943052 we are hoping for more than three million signatures to be sent to the npa the charges against zuma must be withdrawn unreservedly and unconditionally

943054 the so called majority ruling by the constitutional court is a minority amongst us because we know that it is a political trial
943055 we will do everything in our power to stop this shenaniganism sic

943066 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
943067 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race

943072 no news publication has dared to barely scratch the surface like this before
943073 this profile sets a benchmark for mindless filler by which all other features about sen obama will now be judged just impressive puff journalism all around
943074 the sheer breadth of fluff in this story is something to be marveled at
943075 when the american people cast their vote this november this is the piece of fluff theyre going to remember
943076 not the ones by newsweek harpers the new yorker the atlantic the new republic the economist nightline the wall street journal or even that story about lessons obama learned from his first grade teacher we ran a month ago
943077 my editors told me that if i wanted to uncover the most frivolous trivial information on obama i had to be prepared to follow the puff
943078 that meant that not only did i have to stay and watch sen obama play endless games of basketball with city firemen to show readers how athletic and youthful he is but i also had to go to nba shooting experts to learn what aspects of his jump shot are good and what parts are great
943079 if we were going to get the story we wanted it was my responsibility as a journalist to ask the really tough questions to his two young daughters
943080 i also had to capitalize on every opportunity to compare the story of obamas upbringing and rise to power to that of martin luther king jr s and john f kennedys no matter how suspect those parallels really are

943086 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
943087 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
943088 so what they are going to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like those other presidents on the dollar bills
943089 you know he doesnt look like all of those other presidents on the dollar bills
943090 yeah frodo where the hell have you been travelling with obama again
943091 some of you who have been around a long time may get a kick out of this frodo
943092 in reference to lotr and emo frodo did anybody else get the idea that both bilbo and frodo were well lads

943107 so much of boyhood has become off limits due to the for the children mentality that the only way a boys natural bach stuff up instincts can be expressed is virtually kinda sad really
943108 i cant do it anymore these guys are their own parody nobody could exaggerate the headlines in my own paper
943109 obama he is running for president of the us or president of the world
943110 it would only stand to reason that citizens of the eu would be allowed to vote in our elections by absentee of course

943112 bapa mengapa tampak oleh ku bebatuan dengan teratur tersebar di sekitar daerah ini apakah gerangan semua itu

943115 tidakkah benih pohon ara itu akan mati karena tertindih batu sebesar itu bapa
943116 tidak anak ku sepintas lalu memang batu itu tampak sebagai beban yang akan mematikan benih pohon ara tetapi justru batu yang besar itulah yang membuat pohon ara itu sanggup bertahan hidup dan berkembang sebesar yang kau lihat di tepi jalan kemarin
943117 batu yang besar itu sengaja diletakkan oleh penanamnya menindih benih pohon ara mereka melakukan itu sehingga benih itu tersembunyi terhadap hembusan angin dan dari mata segala hewan samapai beberapa waktu kemudian benih itu akan berakar semakin banyak dan semakin kuat walau tidak tampak kehidupan di atas permukaannya tetapi dibawah akarnya terus menjalar setelah dirasa cukup barulah tunas nya akan muncul perlahan pohon ara itu akan tumbuh semakin besar dan kuat hingga akhirnya akan sanggup menggulingkan batu yang menindihnya demikianlah pohon ara itu hidup dan hampir di setiap pohon ara akan kau temui sebuah batu seolah menjadi peringatan bahwa batu yang pernah menindih benih pohon ara itu tidak akan membinasakannya selanjutnya benih itu menjadi pohon besar yang mampu menaungi segala mahluk yang berlindung dari terik matahari yang membakar

943277 molecular tests are proving to be important in clinical practice this assay has the potential to detect occult metastases and may improve staging which could ultimately lead to greater confidence for physicians and patients when selecting treatment options

943306 i also always wanted my own barbecue joint and i think one that operated out of a boxcar would be pretty nifty
943307 i watched the prices go up when i went to the supermarket
943308 once you have to choose between eating and fuel theres nothing greater than going back to the beginning and making your own
943309 with the way things are going it may be something a lot more people are realistically doing
943310 its not only the high cost of food but the high cost of every other activity people are staying around their homes and looking to do things they find rewarding
943311 i think the thing that tipped the scale was the fuel and food costs
943312 we ordered three times as many fruit trees as ever before
943313 we sold out of all the vegetables in june seeds too
943314 were sick of rising fuel and food prices so were turning this weed patch into a vegetable garden want to help
943315 its just a wonderful gritty environment theres a sense of discovery
943316 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
943317 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
943318 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
943319 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
943320 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
943321 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls

943324 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes

943328 were not immune to the difficulties posed by the market turbulence but when you stand back from the short term difficulties i think its also important to say to ourselves two things one weve had a very robust set of results in all of the circumstances and two were pursuing were implementing a strategy which is as valid as ever and which will deliver strong performance over the medium and longer term

943333 while claiming he is different mccain has morphed with the bush legacy the mccain of 2008 is not the maverick or independent brand of 2000
943334 to conform to conservative republican thought from immigration to allowing cia torture to the bush tax breaks for the rich
943335 gay marriage for it now against it allowing rape and incest exceptions when banning abortion now he wants no exceptions warrantless wiretaps wanted president to have warrant no longer and holding detainees without evidence against now for
943336 the only place mccain has indeed been consistent is in pressing the iraq war
943337 in early april this year mccain went walking in the heart of baghdad and then commented there are neighborhoods in baghdad where you and i could walk today but backing up that stroll were 10 armored humvees soldiers with automatic rifles and two apache attack helicopters circling overhead
943338 to fight the real war on terror against the real al qaida we must recognize that it is very much on the rebound stronger than it was before 9 11 but in afghanistan pakistan and 60 other countries osama bin laden is still on the loose mccain doesnt get it he makes no mention of the unclear mission for the war in iraq
943339 mccain has reverted to platforms of the incumbent president as the war drags on and millions lose their homes retirement income and sense of national security the mccain flight from former straight talker to conservative ideologue will firm up the legacy of bushs failures
943340 after an extensive search we finally found an agency we believe will help us brand my design business and books

943347 the study demonstrates that our tight junction technology effectively delivers pyy into the body via nasal administration but that the peptide itself is not effective as a single agent for weight loss
943348 we are pleased that once again our delivery technology has effectively and safely delivered a large molecule via the intranasal route with good tolerability but disappointed that pyy did not show more promising therapeutic effect we believe our intranasal delivery technology continues to demonstrate value as a means of safely administering peptides and proteins and believe that pyy might still prove effective in combination with other weight loss drugs we would like to thank the investigators staff and patients who participated in the trial
943349 this new agreement reflects gileads ongoing commitment to ensuring global access to the first and only single tablet regimen for the treatment of hiv

943352 we are pleased to continue this tradition by partnering with gilead sciences to make this important medicine available to patients who need it
943353 it just creates the potential for a permanent record for all this type of stuff

943367 when one examines the questions asked and the scales used they are utterly subjective measures
943368 psychiatrys claim that mental illnesses are brain diseases is not true there are no objective diagnostic tests to confirm or disconfirm the diagnosis of depression there is no blood or other biological test to ascertain the presence or absence of a mental illness as there is for most bodily diseases
943369 not one has been proved quite on the contrary in every instance where such an imbalance was thought to have been found it was later proven false
943370 the theories are held on to not only because there is nothing else to take their place but also because they are useful in promoting drug treatment
943371 in fact the bit that tv3 didnt play has me saying that while some of our supporters worry about kiwibank its actually working
943372 so no theres no issues of public trust our positions quite clear
943373 if theres any change to that position and were not working on that but if theres any change to that position we will go out with a mandate we will go out to seek that mandate by going out and asking the voters of new zealand whether they support a particular policy or not
943374 i dont care i dont think shanghai is being neglected the olympics is really boring anyway

943376 i cant take business trips to beijing thanks to the olympics it has already caused too much trouble to daily life
943377 we need the olympics but we need our normal life too

943389 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
943390 they leave the security council no choice but to increase the sanctions as called for in the last resolution passed
943391 when it comes to sanctions experience shows that it is ineffective especially when it comes to the nuclear issue
943392 of course in the event of a possible war we will aim to prolong its duration so as to be able to take advantage of all our missile and non missile capabilities
943393 our operating income in the second quarter of 2008 increased 39 as our overall business performed well although we had temporary delays in coal shipments due to flooding in the midwest as well as a spike in the price of diesel fuel these negative factors were offset by effective management of our costs and gains on the sale of surplus assets with four new customers coming on line in may we continue to offset weakness in lumber and forest products shipments in oregon and eastern canada resulting from the weak u s housing market our general outlook for the remainder of 2008 and into 2009 remains positive despite the uncertain economic environment
943394 the financial performance of gwis three recent acquisitions cagy industries maryland midland and rotterdam rail feeding has been consistent with our expectations and their outlook is good we remain active in the acquisition market as our strong balance sheet and cash flow is proving to be a significant competitive advantage

943458 i met a thoroughly educated man who had his facts and figures at his finger tips and was convincingly concerned about moving nigeria forward
943459 structural adjustment policies imposed by bretton woods institutions removed governments from food production and this is a major cause of loss of food sovereignty
943460 market policies have failed the poor food prices are rising they are more hungry people the doha round failed recently over contentious agricultural issues because the us and the european union failed to remove subsidies for their own farmers
943461 people are beginning to compete with cars there is a rapid rise in crop production for fuel large conglomerates are integrating vertically from the fields to the fuel tanks and not much to the dinner plate
943462 in the us only four corporates decide what you will eat and not the us government anymore there is a big danger that zimbabwe and africa might lose food sovereignty if multinationals are allowed to come in and exploit food crops for biofuels
943463 maize is a staple for people here and once its commodified for agro fuels production the community identity and sustenance will be lost
943464 it is the rural poor who will bear the cost of the agro fuel boom while reaping few of the benefits
943465 the shortage of fuel has also been a challenge within the region and this has led to sadc countries putting large areas of land under plants which will be processed to produce fuel
943466 this has greatly affected agriculture and also food security of the region
943467 these industrial conglomerates see africa as a green opec for the world the amount of grain required to fill the 90 litre tank of a 4x4 once with ethanol will feed one person for a year
943468 jatropha will take good soils from food crops is it right to make land available for agro fuels production in a food deficit region there is need to tackle agro fuels in the context of our land policies
943469 if you dont put restrictions you will soon be importing agro fuels back from rich countries in the north local communities should be involved in land use planning and energy use options
943470 there is a real danger that africa will produce food crops for foreign profit
943471 we see no reason why the new bio diesel plant has to be the last rather than the first we have a first class feedstock jatropha that can grow even in matabeleland south the nearest zimbabwe gets to a desert
943472 we have vast areas of the lowveld now barren that could grow sugar with irrigation available if a major national effort is made to complete dams now being built and implement plans already drawn up for more
943473 for that matter sugar has been grown and can be grown in the zambezi valley using water from that great river
943474 so instead of oil companies and oilmen growing rich on zimbabwes scarce foreign currency we can have our own farmers growing rich so buying the stuff that we their customers make and so making us rich
943475 but in all of this we must remember that we are not going it alone we are following in the footsteps of rapidly industrialising countries such as brazil and india that have already worked this out all it needs is commitment from all in zimbabwe

943496 theyre not easy holes you have to hit it in the fairways which i did mostly and gave myself good birdie chances
943497 my distance control and my irons were good and i thought i handled the pressure pretty good
943498 i know its not easy to finish off around this golf course because a lot can happen on the back nine theyre not easy holes

943507 we did that very well daisuke came out and threw his fastball stayed in his delivery and the ball came out of his hand real well he looked like he was pitching with confidence we played with energy it was a good day

943511 thats the point it theyre dropped theyre not an issue
943512 were so far back in points it really is going to give us an opportunity to evaluate a lot of things
943513 texas was a different deal were all on the same page on this and everything is going according to the plan i was mad at texas and you know im not going to hide it if im mad about it we dont have a shot of getting back in the top 35 and so when you get to that position then you can try a lot of different stuff
943514 you dont want to mess up the other three teams but were still working on it and i think well get it done in the next couple of weeks
943515 we have always asked nascar for a nationwide race or a truck race and theres never been room in the schedule
943516 at this point im not going to speculate ive got my fingers crossed i hope we get it but they have never come up to me and said youre getting it heres the date were absolutely 100 percent at their mercy
943517 yeah i told dale jr that maybe hes out and ron is in for next week smiles
943518 obviously to win here at circuit gilles villeneuve is huge for me because gilles was a hero of mine

943521 i feel jinxed full stop ive come a long way to be part of nascar and im two and a half years into this deal and havent gotten a victory ive got second third fourth fifth whatever but that win has alluded me i guess if you keep knocking on the door it will come i feel comfortable out there i feel like i belong i feel like if we keep at it the win will fall our way but right now its a bitter pill to swallow i havent had this good a race and not won twice in a row before at a track its usual this place has been great to me were going to come back next year im sure and try and break that win then well be off but who knows im disappointed but life goes on ive got two healthy girls back home im looking forward to getting home and seeing those girls tonight and play in the sandbox tomorrow and have a swim and forget about life

943543 youre the 2nd person tonight to tell me ive gotten taller im 21 isnt that kinda late for growth spurts
943544 i work on the principle that its not possible to take anyones views on music seriously if they dont like the beatles everything else is a question of personal taste and therefore debatable but if you dont recognise the beatles as the twentieth centurys most inventive most influential and most talented composers youre pretty much admitting that youve rather missed the point of the last hundred years of musical endeavour should you fall into that category i do not condemn neither do i mock i merely despair and having despaired i move on
943545 maybe they are saying something to me that im not hearing
943546 wait a minute let me really get behind what they are saying to understand whether theyre reacting because theyre hurt upset confused or they dont understand what it is ive asked them to do
943547 hey wait a minute maybe im wrong in reacting the way i do because this person is really making an effort

943553 our concern was raised when we received many petitions from nigerians complaining about the indecency portrayed by the big brother africa reality programme
943554 we are saying that whatever business that must come to nigeria must respect the social cultural values and ideologies of our government and the people
943555 all the aspects of the programme we received complaint about should be removed aspects like shower hour promiscuity and drunkenness

943564 minister shamu expressed interest in the poem after i had told him about it during the chitungwiza central hospital fund raising gala held recently the minister told me that plans were currently underway to hold a memorial of the late simon chimbetu and said he would love to have me as part of that programme
943565 this kind of poetry was first triggered by the death of simon chimbetu
943566 i decided to name the poem ndarangarira gamba after one of his chimbetus songs that talks about the heroic exploits of a freedom fighter but in this context it is a musical hero who has passed on leaving a yawning void
943567 all this stems from my deep passion for music and respect for local musicians for instance i showed the poem on simon chimbetu to his son sulumane and although he was too busy he expressed interest in it
943568 i was at zbc radio studios for a poetry programme the other day when wellington jonga heard and liked ndarangarira gamba
943569 that is when he advised me to write a poem on mashakada who had been hospitalised then for diabetes and i did just that leading to the poems inclusion on mashakadas album
943570 although i dont earn anything in terms of royalties as a result of having my poem featured on mashakadas album the only positive thing is hearing my poem on radio
943571 i didnt write it for financial gain in fact i am not bitter although i am still struggling to get a copy of the album

943607 i studied reincarnation in india and thought there was truth and justice in the theory that we come back to learn and grow i taught the theory and wanted to bring it to the world i felt that i remembered far back into my past but i was mistaken when you become sensitive and can feel the spirits around you they speak to you by impressions and their past will be like a panorama a person feels it and will relive the past of spirits but the mistake is made of taking this for the memory of past incarnations i did not know this when i lived on earth but when i came to the spirit side of life i learned differently once you reach the spirit world where all is congenial where all is life where all is bliss where there is no jealousy no envy where all is one grand harmony do you think for one moment that you would want to leave that beautiful condition to come back to earth and be a little baby restricted in mind and knowing nothing whatever

943648 jeanne shaheen read the press release from chuck schumer she didnt read the legislation and she came out for the wrong bill
943649 have been out of step from where the voters of new hampshire are
943650 its probably the best test out there of a political climate being a republican incumbents worst enemy
943651 he does constituent service he shows up to work he votes he brings home the bacon there are not a lot of inherent things wrong with john sununu except that he is a republican
943652 but with the economy going the way it has been going the last few years nobody in any office looks too good right now
943653 that kind of effective leadership will be contrasted by the media by me by others to the things she failed to do as governor
943654 she raised spending to record levels which i think people have come to expect from liberal democrats
943655 when i am out on the campaign trail talking to people in new hampshire i dont hear people say we need to elect a democrat
943656 what i hear them say is we need to change the direction of this country

943660 you know when we were co stars i always told abhishek a world tour is something he must experience in fact for one of my world tours i had even asked my organisers to ask him to come onboard hed say not yet not yet and who wouldve thought when hes finally ready for his first world tour wed go together as husband and wife
943661 its a wonderful experience we have danced together on screen and also performed together but weve never been on a concert tour together even the audiences all over now respond to us as a couple they keep showering us with blessings and good wishes
943662 all the boys have been talking about it so it was good to get an early goal
943663 you always worry that if you are not scoring youll find yourself on the bench but it was a case of just getting on with it
943664 there was no panic ive been bursting the net in training and if you are doing that then hopefully you take it into games
943665 it was disappointing to lose the lead as i felt this was a game we should have won we played well for 70 minutes but then there was a lack of concentration three crosses three goals we must do better than that
943666 we created some fantastic chances scored two great goals and could and should have scored more but all in all i was really pleased the players showed they have got it
943667 that was the turning point it can make a big difference and they got on top
943668 it comes down to confidence and sometimes you can get bogged down with results and forget its pre season
943669 i think we had less to lose against middlesbrough in the sense they were stronger opposition we played more freely we got our passing going the heads were up and the crowd was buzzing
943670 im confident we will get it together for saturday to score two goals against such opposition was good while we looked dangerous and created chances
943671 i know what the headline will now be how many games have we lost i am not interested in that i am only interested in winning at kilmarnock
943672 i was pleased with the way we passed the ball and used the width of the pitch i was really pleased with the determination and application the performance was very good for 70 minutes
943673 believe it or not we are working hard behind the scenes the ability has never ever been in question they have it but the players have to realise that hard work comes first and foremost
943674 i listened to the middlesbrough bench shouting to anticipate to win the second ball and thats the attitude you must have if you are defending a certain area you must make sure no one goes through that area if you are attacking make sure that final pass gets there and if you have a chance to score you score
943675 i dont think he showed his best qualities he can do a lot better but he has only been training for ten days and hasnt played a game

943683 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering

943686 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life
943687 it is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence

943707 although financial stocks rallied sharply during mid july we believe the gains will be short lived we expect that the negative effects of continued home price declines and contracting credit will lead to a decline in consumer spending and in turn a decline in u s gdp
943708 as the economy weakens we expect credit costs will continue to rise resulting in weaker financial earnings the need for additional capital and lower stock prices for financials
943709 will continue to deleverage for the foreseeable future more than likely shedding assets and raising capital until their leverage levels decline well into the teens

943718 on his blog petko d petkov reported that quicktime media link files contain a qtnext attribute that could be used on windows systems to launch the default browser with arbitrary command line options when the default browser is firefox 2 0 0 6 or earlier use of the chrome option allowed a remote attacker to run script commands with the full privileges of the user this could be used to install malware steal local data or otherwise corrupt the victims computer
943719 to protect firefox users from this problem we have now eliminated the ability to run arbitrary script from the command line other command line options remain however and quicktime media link files could still be used to annoy users with popup windows and dialogs until this issue is fixed in quicktime this quicktime issue appears to be the one described by cve 2006 4965 but the fix apple applied in quicktime 7 1 5 does not prevent this version of the problem
943720 no one diverted the products meant for benue farmers but the point remains that government alone cannot procure all the fertilizer required by farmers in the state in fact the way out of this is for the total deregulation of the market which will allow free importation and sale of the products by interested business men who will also be allowed to sell at their own prices
943721 the details should be in the handover notes to engr yaradua by his predecessor he should check and find out who collected the money and for what but if you are talking about the repairs of the chanomi crude oil pipeline i am aware that fenong was paid 105 000
943722 the price we pay is very high it is difficult to get expatriates to work in the niger delta we paid militants 12 million in two months because we are losing 81 million to the problem of chanomi pipeline in delta state
943723 from our knowledge the nnpc disbursed over 25million for the scam which was shared by the top commanders of the military joint task force senior government officials in the delta state governors office top management staff in the nnpc and the presidency
943724 we did not pay mend or any militant group all we did was to award the pipeline repairs contract to a community based company and some community group who assured us that they can protect the lines were also engaged by the corporation
943725 the fact is that the gmd of the nnpc gave the true detail of what happened any other statement after that by the nnpc is damage control using a company as a cover is not new in perfecting a fraud in nigeria
943726 this 12 million thing is a deal between some top officials of the nnpc and some people who claimed that they would protect the pipelines
943727 if it is a militant leader that collected the money nigerians want to know they want to know if he came to the nnpc to collect the money in cash or a cheque was issued to him which bank did he cash it and what for
943728 the militants know our mode of operation better than we know their own
943729 because these people are faceless they know us they see us but we dont know them they noticed that our ships are in warri and that was why they went there
943730 but with smaller and faster boats that are sea going the militants could get there faster
943731 we knew what the new players were about before they joined the club
943732 we can take a lot of positives out of the performance and build on it
943733 ive not scored enough goals in the last couple of years so it will be one of my aims to score more goals

943737 we have it in our power to begin the world over again
943738 the manner the commission is going about the exercise is quite disturbing
943739 we were horrified to learn that of the 11 proposed state assembly constituencies in delta state no single one was considered for burutu bomadi patani and the ijaws of warri south west warri north and warri south
943740 it is therefore saddening that the commission could base the entire exercise on only one criterion that is population
943741 our children are ever ready to go to schools but the problem is that almost all of us have to go out daily to raise money to eat not even to talk of enrolling our children in school
943742 the primary function of a trial court or tribunal is to evaluate evidence placed before it before arriving at a conclusion
943743 it is only where and when a trial court fails to evaluate evidence placed before it properly or at all that a court of appeal can intervene and in itself evaluate or re evaluate such evidence
943744 in the case at hand the trial court failed to assess the evidence or the witnesses and also did not review or evaluate them
943745 worse still the opinion of his advocate was not considered as required by the law and so warrant this courts intervention to evaluate or re evaluate the evidence adduced at the trial court
943746 indeed the appellants conviction and sentence in counts 3 4 and 7 cannot stand since those counts were a duplication of the other counts when the particulars of the offences are viewed
943747 in totality it was clearly evident that the appellant was not treated fairly in all ramifications and the trial fell short of what is expected even at a lay mans tribunal
943748 the appeal succeeds as i set aside the conviction and sentences in all the seven counts charges of the court martial as confirmed appeal allowed

943760 where in the world would i buy be able to buy a seemingly comfortable pair of used panties if i was so inclined
943761 it is no surprise that the whole exercise was a bundle of conspiracy with which the government of plateau state and inec has now come to be openly associated with
943762 those who were ready to implement the wishes of inec against mantu were brought in
943763 sometime in 2003 i came to kaduna from katsina state where i was working as an auto and met aisha seating in my mothers room she told me that she has since been divorced by musa and she even showed me a divorce letter purportedly given to her by musa i believed her when i saw the letter and that same day we had sexual intercourse together
943764 one day i received money sent by aisha requesting me to relocate to kaduna so that we can get married somehow i did not come back then but she later called to tell me that she has put to bed but it was a still birth
943765 thought aisha was my legitimate wife because she had stayed with me for a very long time sometimes she stays with me on an on and off basis initially we were having intercourse with aisha in my friends room it was eventually that i decided to rent a room where my mother was equally renting
943766 aisha moved and stayed with me for quite a long time one day i returned home from a journey and was informed by my mother that aishas father came and took her away aishas father who was not in support of the relationship said he wants his daughter to deliver at home
943767 that is the main reason which prompted me to demand for my children
943768 all i know is that any time we had problems she usually leaves my house for some days and whenever i visit her parents house so that we can resolve the crisis for her to come back to her matrimonial home i dont always find her there most of the time i was always told that she either travelled to makarfi zaria or paki
943769 we have been married with my husband for the past 16 years and in the beginning we had no child and his family members thought i was barren now that i have children they are still bringing unnecessary allegations because they dont like me
943770 although we sometimes have problem which is quite normal in any matrimonial home i sometimes offend him just like he offends me some times
943771 ever since i got married to musa ive never set my eyes on him again
943772 i only know aisha when my friend musa was about to marry her now i cant say anything about aishas behavior
943773 she has been staying with her parents all through the court proceedings even though i did not send her packing it means she chose to stay with her parents
943774 i will not divorce her now and after serving her jail i would allow her to stay with her parent so that they can see the kind of daughter they have i would divorce her later at my convenience so that she can have the freedom to marry whoever she likes but i cannot stay with her as a wife again

943777 the latest breakdown by the new york times of which states are considered to be in play in the presidential election along with how all the states voted in the past five elections
943778 we accept there are issues with the payment of rent
943779 a cash flow was submitted to representatives of rochdale council the football club and the stadium company which will see the rent owed paid in full this plan was wholly agreed
943780 mr garlicks quoted figures are inaccurate furthermore a stadium board meeting was held less than two weeks ago and mr garlick gave us no indication he was about to launch this attack
943781 positive discussions took place and a follow up meeting was agreed for next week we are at a loss as to colins motives for deciding to reveal what are inaccurate facts to the football clubs fans
943782 we believed we had a good relationship with both colin garlick and the stadium company but this is clearly not the case
943783 we wonder what the future holds for a positive working relationship when there has been such a serious breach of trust and confidence between hornets and the secretary of the stadium company
943784 as a board hornets regret mr garlicks unnecessary decision to re open discussions relating to the recent tournament originally planned to be held at the stadium
943785 this was at no time a rochdale afc issue and we never indicated that it was
943786 the children still enjoyed a great day out at hornets playing the competition at oulder hill courtesy of operon the schools management company and then being presented to the fans at half time when they received their trophies
943787 again we as a club are very curious as to why colin garlick feels hornets were in any way responsible for any negative press as a result of the local authoritys solicitor catherine whithams written instruction that hornets should not go ahead with the summer festival on the pitch at spotland
943788 oh f my neck will break the kid will drown
943789 there are some very good quarterbacks in the competition but i have to feel that he has more than proven that he is one of the best in the country
943790 i love the tempo he plays with he never rushes anything and is always under control he threw the ball very well today and you can tell he still has a lot left in his tank
943791 i told people before this is going to be a team that will pull some major surprises
943792 this team didnt come an hour and a half to roll over we respected the field in this tournament and welcomed the challenge
943793 i have watched every great safety in this state in this class and he is top 5 hes that good
943794 i have worked hard stayed in shape and put my arm through plenty of tests this summer
943795 i have looked forward to going to california and proving that i am as good as any of the quarterbacks in the country

943802 hopefully if he keeps going like this he can win a race like the epsom

943804 but hes heading the right way now hes improving all the time
943805 daniel steele has proved to be one of the guggenheims greatest assets
943806 when i first came to the guggenheim daniel was an assistant curator he has flourished over the years assuming an increasingly important leadership role in the international development of the guggenheim during his tenure as director daniel has strengthened the visibility and reputation of the guggenheim museum as an extraordinary cultural resource and helped the museum realize its institutional goals as the flagship of our global network we wish him the greatest success in his new endeavors
943807 we are very grateful to dan for his tremendous contributions and we wish him well
943808 recruiting his successor will be a priority for the board and we will begin that process immediately
943809 it has been an honor to serve the guggenheim for almost 29 years
943810 i am proud of the guggenheim staff which manages one of the worlds most successful and important art museums i know they are ready to create an even more exciting future the development department has been revitalized and we have a strong and creative curatorial faculty who are already developing new initiatives related to southeastern american art and to architecture
943811 in those meetings if he wants to keep the player hell do everything he can to do so and hell probably succeed as well
943812 what he is doing is in the interests of manchester united thats what he always thinks of

944190 david goldblatts work is about buildings and structures in the south african landscape it is in part about actual structures bricks mortar mud and corrugated iron but it is also about ideological structuring about the mental constructs that underpinned the structures of south africa in its colonial era and more specifically the apartheid years the locust years of its recent past what goldblatt has done is to frame these physical structures in terms of photographic constructs which cumulatively and compellingly reveal the many ways in which ideology has shaped our landscape
944191 goldblatt worked on the particular series for many years and in this publication he brings together photographs of south africa people illustrating how a small detail of a body clothing hair or skin can lead a viewer to make judgments about class and colour and time and place

944222 the children themselves fare very badly from influenza but they are also the source of infection for many adults
944223 there is an urgent need for the jcvi to review their decision
944224 this vaccination would need to be given every year to be effective
944225 we know that influenza affects the vulnerable the elderly and the young and we also know that flu causes a lot of problems in terms of health and also with the economy with people being off work and so on

944228 aside from the perpetuation of the myth of tacit explicit knowledge conversion more on this tomorrow the idea of compulsion flies in the face of all theory and practice in social computing its a classic find something which is working then ruin it by compulsion
944229 we are proud that alexandr solzhenitsyn was our compatriot and contemporary
944230 changed the minds of millions of people making them rethink their past and present
944231 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
944232 he worked yesterday just like any other day then in the evening death came quickly i am in mourning but i also express gratitude to everyone who will remember this moment remember solzhenitsyn
944233 he wanted to die in summer and died in summer he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i must say that alexander isayevich lived a difficult but happy life
944234 this place of rest was chosen by alexander isayevich himself while he was alive
944235 the best way to destroy your enemy is to make him your friend
944236 hes put so many contingencies around it that i wonder in fact i question whether he would do it at all
944237 it may be a way for him to gain favor during the election and tube it later because all the contingencies werent met
944238 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
944239 we demand the academic freedom to gain knowledge and a society that doesnt allow scientists to do that has got a problem
944240 the people who are responsible for the recent vandalism are acting criminally aside from impairing scientific research and damaging property they are now putting innocent people at risk
944241 the industry is very anxious that unfavorable facts dont get out there one tactic is to tar any critic as irrational
944242 its really tough to get our viewpoints represented in the media
944243 the biotech industrys claims about genetically altered crops are perennially overstated in truth agricultural biotechnology has almost nothing to offer to the world food crisis in the short term
944244 when gmos were developed in the u s we didnt know what was hitting us it was in our food service before people understood what gmo meant
944245 by the time gmos became standard we had no choice we couldnt have labeling because it was already happening by the time it got across the pond in the uk they had the advantage of seeing it happen here first
944246 the b3000 brewer offers the most advanced single cup brewing technology and the design of the product garners raves from our distributors and customers

944258 henbane is a very toxic plant and should never be eaten
944259 i was thinking of a wild plant with a similar name not this herb

944261 as always check with an expert when foraging or collecting wild plants

944263 hsbc have accepted that they will be responsible for ensuring that all those people who bought gifts through wrapit using either a credit card or a visa debit card get a full refund if they request one
944264 so the only people who will lose out will be those who bought using a switch maestro card or a cheque these amount to about 20 of purchases american express users will get a refund through amex
944265 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money and as things stand they will not take it
944266 we said prayers for them both at services at the little country church where they married and at our other church in alltwen

944276 a lot of things are shaping up very nicely in terms of our passing and composure that was the best so far
944277 we wanted a progression from the performance against torquay and we certainly got it we had an exceptional first half and we passed the ball very very well and created a number of chances
944278 we took a deserved lead with a good goal from jeff hughes and our defensive organisation was good and copenhagen werent a threat at all
944279 hes got a great left foot and scored some cracking goals hes added something to the left wing position

944291 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
944292 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
944293 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
944294 molemate is a non invasive rapid and painless mole screening device that enables a medical practitioner to quickly scan your moles showing information up to 2mm under the skin this can assist them in making an instant decision on the health of the mole

944296 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
944297 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels therefore the therapeutic window to achieve an optimal risk benefit ratio of gh in individuals with hiv abdominal fat accumulation and insulin resistance may be very narrow and difficult to achieve

944312 i think its a dramatic example of the influence of special interests here in the congress

944338 but one of the nice things about writing for my own soul and my own prayer is that i kind of move along with the community of people who know his music and i can write things that are meaningful for those same people
944339 both of those approaches work for me its not that one is more common than the other
944340 and it opened the door for other pieces to enter non catholic denominations i know that city of god and maybe sing a new song are sung especially in lutheran methodist and presbyterian communities
944341 we had a huge shift that came with the second vatican council and a call to adapt our liturgy to this modern world rather than living and worshiping in a way that was somewhat disconnected from our daily and weekly experience it was a shifting of the ground beneath many peoples feet
944342 a shift of the pendulum in the other way sort of a balancing were being reminded not to lose some of the pieces of music and rituals that have been part of our long roman catholic tradition
944343 performance in our core businesses was broadly flat some were down a bit

944347 many concerns that the intelligence community voiced that made it difficult to prosecute leaks
944348 the showing that the danger exceeds the value of disclosure is a complete imponderable
944349 that would require the government to come in and basically make a bad problem worse by articulating precisely how threatened disclosure could cause yet more harm
944350 what im not willing to do is to take steps that will essentially do more to protect leakers than it does to protect journalists
944351 fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow
944352 i hope that this is part of the beginning of a dialogue that this country needs to engage in concerning what the effects of slavery and jim crow have been

944367 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
944368 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
944369 all of us not only those of us directly affected but all of us need to know more than we do today
944370 both domestically and overseas with the notion that it could have been a part of a broader terrorist network but it could also have been the act of a deranged individual or two
944371 persistently used funds and employees of citizens alliance for their personal and political benefit
944372 its a deliciously entertaining document that should be read by every political science student in america
944373 absolutely a pennsylvania statute provides for it its in their right to pay the legal bills for people who are being sued because of activities in connection to the charities
944374 to me theres a difference between paying for some suit thats in ones service to the organization that has been approved by the board and another in paying legal bills due to the unilateral taking of the assets
944375 the board had an independent attorney validate the hiring of our firm in the matter
944376 it wouldnt be appropriate to say anything about a case thats going to trial in five weeks
944377 would seek restoration of any assets that may have been taken
944378 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
944379 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
944380 how could parents have been so unloving how could professionals have been so indifferent and most of all
944381 how could the philadelphia department of human services the giant expensive safety net we have set up to protect the children of uncaring or incompetent parents have been so uncaring and incompetent
944382 the lack of attention we paid to this case its a huge system failure
944383 im the commissioner at dhs and i have every intention of doing all that needs to be done to correct the deficiencies that were pointed out in this report
944384 our role is to help vulnerable children and families and we failed
944385 i probably would have assigned anne marie which tells me i still have the confidence in her to turn this agency around
944386 this organization has been studied again and again and again its an organization that is very good at starting but has had a tradition of not being able to move change all the way through the system
944387 im ok with people telling us were doing something wrong and revisiting a decision
944388 it occurred to us as we looked through the pile of candidates nationally that we had a gem
944389 many people were focused on the system as a system anne marie was focused on children and families
944390 create a culture of accountability throughout dhs at all levels starting with senior management
944391 there have been many reform efforts in the past that have followed tragic child deaths yet they were inadequate in one crucial way
944392 they lacked sustained leadership and management structure that would allow any of the recommendations to be implemented correctly or to hold anyone accountable for their failure or success
944393 i think annie does have her work cut out for her
944394 the unions position has always been we would like to see accountability on all levels annie is the person to do that she is somebody who does believe in management being even more responsible than people on the lower level of the totem pole
944395 i really do cut to the chase i am decisive i try to include everybodys viewpoints
944396 i want someone there who knows the child and presents the case our structure is not conducive to doing individual advocacy on these kids and that has to change
944397 im thinking one thing and youre thinking another and lets get on the same page
944398 i thought i had a job and she had a passion
944399 i dont know if envious is the word but i was impressed by the fact that she woke up every day and went to work for much different reasons than i did
944400 you asked me what makes me smile when i think of her and thats it she loves kids and really is fighting for them

944452 bagi kami industri pengolahan impor daging brasil menguntungkan dibukanya kran impor
944453 harganya hanya 60 dari harga daging sapi australia dan new zeland
944454 industri olahan punya standar yang lebih tinggi peternak rakyat masih kurang memenuhi syarat kita mengharapkan daging yang cukup dan murah
944455 yang menjadi masalah teman teman yang mempermasalahkan adalah sistemnya kita terlalu jelek sehingga memungkin berpeluang masuknya daging berasal diluar dari zona aman
944456 sekarang diperbatasan banyak penyelundupan ini sudah lama tapi buktinya kita tidak terkena pmk
944457 performance kita saat ini sudah bagus jadi sudah banyak yang datang kira kira 33 investor yang datang 80 persennya asing
944458 dulu kan kita berencana ipo 30 persenan tapi baru 15 persen yang dilepas jadi kita masih punya spare 15 persen lagi dan itu bisa dilepas
944459 modal kita masih mencukupi car kita masih di atas 12 persen jadi masih cukup besar lagian juga kan pertimbangan kita saat ini kondisi market lagi jelek jadi kita tunggu kondisi market membaik sehingga dapat harga yang bagus

944477 we are happy here the slower expansion of the economy may slow growth a bit but in the long term there is a lot of growth to be had

944479 i think in time these rules will be done away with
944480 our advertisement on television and the internet is very very good except for local television

944486 the build we played was only 70 complete but the split screen was slick fluid and fast
944487 this is very important very important because were working hard for golf in argentina
944488 i was concerned at the three eighths pole and i thought we were beat turning for home
944489 but he got down on his belly and he won
944490 he found a new gear and just kept sticking his neck out
944491 at the top of the stretch that horse took off but big brown just kept coming and i knew wed get him at the three sixteenths pole he switched leads and then at the eighth pole he took off again
944492 he showed his heart and courage which was a side of him i hadnt seen until today
944493 its very rough when things go right for you and you dont get the win
944494 big brown always won his other races with such ease
944495 its been about 60 days of nervousness i had a dream last night that he won but this race was a lot closer than the one in my dream were thrilled
944496 if it was up to me i wouldnt run him back so quick
944497 its definitely frustrating when the team is having such a good season and youre not really part of it
944498 its a little tougher since wes came back but i think ive competed pretty well
944499 welker and moss are two different kinds of players with randy outside and wes in the slot but they both run great routes and you can learn a lot watching them
944500 the coaches havent told me anything but i am listed on the depth chart for both punts and kickoffs
944501 i want to get out there catch a ball and run with it
944502 sometimes it feels like i havent done that since college
944503 it was something ive been looking forward to for a long time its just good to get back out there and compete
944504 it was a slick field and derry is a good hitting team i told the kids 12 runs wouldnt hold up and we would have to probably score 20 to win
944505 the kids responded well we were kind of down after giving up those three runs but we responded with eight it was huge
944506 why should i try to outsing saigal let him remain enshrined in our memory let his songs remain just his songs let not even one person say that kishore kumar sang them better
944507 i was the biggest draw after dilip kumar there were so many films i was doing in those days that i had to run from one set to the other changing on the way imagine me my shirts flying off my trousers falling off my wig coming off while im running from one set to the other very often i would mix up my lines and look angry in a romantic scene or romantic in the midst of a fierce battle it was terrible and i hated it it evoked nightmares of school directors were like schoolteachers do this do that dont do this dont do that i dreaded it thats why i would often escape
944508 look i dont smoke drink or socialise i never go to parties if that makes me a loner fine i am happy this way i go to work and i come back straight home to watch my horror movies play with my spooks talk to my trees sing in this avaricious world every creative person is bound to be lonely how can you deny me that right
944509 people bore me film people particularly bore me i prefer talking to my trees
944510 there was this interior decorator a suited booted fellow who came to see me in a three piece woollen saville row suit in the thick of summer and began to lecture me about aesthetics design visual sense and all that after listening to him for about half an hour and trying to figure out what he was saying through his peculiar american accent i told him that i wanted something very simple for my living room just water several feet deep and little boats floating around instead of large sofas i told him that the centre piece should be anchored down so that the tea service could be placed on it and all of us could row up to it in our boats and take sips from our cups but the boats should be properly balanced i said otherwise we might whizz past each other and conversation would be difficult he looked a bit alarmed but that alarm gave way to sheer horror when i began to describe the wall decor i told him that i wanted live crows hanging from the walls instead of paintings since i liked nature so much and instead of fans we could have monkeys farting from the ceiling thats when he slowly backed out from the room with a strange look in his eyes the last i saw of him was him running out of the front gate at a pace that would have put an electric train to shame whats crazy about having a living room like that you tell me if he can wear a woollen three piece suit in the height of summer why cant i hang live crows on my walls
944511 i play different roles at different times for different people in this crazy world only the truly sane man appears to be mad look at me do you think im mad do you think i can be manipulative
944512 good business rats one can make money from them if one is enterprising
944513 i was shooting in the south once i think the film was miss mary and these chaps kept me waiting in the hotel room for five days without shooting so i got fed up and started cutting my hair first i chopped off some hair from the right side of my head and then to balance it i chopped off some from the left by mistake i overdid it so i cut off some more from the right again i overdid it so i had to cut from the left again this went on till i had virtually no hair left and thats when the call came from the sets when i turned up the way i was they all collapsed thats how rumours reached bombay they said i had gone cuckoo i didnt know i returned and found everyone wishing me from long distance and keeping a safe distance of 10 feet while talking even those chaps who would come and embrace me waved out from a distance and said hi then someone asked me a little hesitantly how i was feeling i said fine i spoke a little abruptly perhaps suddenly i found him turning around and running far far away from me
944514 leena is a very different kind of person she too is an actress like all of them but shes very different shes seen tragedy shes faced grief when your husband is shot dead you change you understand life you realize the ephemeral quality of all things
944515 im mad true but only about one thing horror movies i love spooks they are a friendly fearsome lot very nice people actually if you get to know them not like these industry chaps out here do you know any spooks
944516 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
944517 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
944518 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
944519 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
944520 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
944521 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
944522 with the crazy path that ive had ive never had one major tournament to show for all of the stuff that ive gone through
944523 its the fact that you get to go to the olympics which is absolutely phenomenal and then theres the other side of it its an accomplishment physically to be back here
944524 what a great tournament we got treated like royalty between the manchester host and babe ruth regional officials it was first class all the way and we were happy to get two wins and send two teams home
944525 were really impressed with that team our guys knew they were in for a battle today they have a lot of respect for those guys i didnt have to say a word to those guys to get them up for the game
944526 i thought we had potential but we got a lot farther than i thought we were going to get
944527 i had to leave the pit box i was afraid he was going to punch me in the neck
944528 carl said what would you do if you thought we would get the track cleaned off and keep running
944529 we argue we get mad we walk away and then we come back together and cooler heads prevail we have arguments and discussions but then we have handshakes and hugs and we come to terms with what we want to do ninety percent of the time it works out for us
944530 one has to play according ot needs of the team not according ot his whims and fancies i would prefer a player who atleast is consistent even though he doesnt score triple hundren rather than this guy who blasts his way to triple hundred and then for the next few innings is useless identify one player in any international team who has such an attitude
944531 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
944532 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
944533 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
944534 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
944535 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
944536 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
944537 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
944538 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
944539 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
944540 you take away the right of sale away from gamers and sales will decrease

944548 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed

944550 the question is is this the best way for maryland to meet its energy needs

944556 su una parte di questi provvedimenti il governo aveva chiesto il voto in campagna elettorale e in qualche misura erano attesi
944557 e una manovra depressiva perch non sostiene gli investimenti in un quadro di riduzione delle spese non fa selezione e insieme non sostiene i consumi perch non interviene sui redditi n dei pensionati n dei lavoratori
944558 male non servito per sostenere i consumi di lavoratori e pensionati e sono stati dati segnali di allentamento della morsa sulla lotta allevasione basti pensare alla sostituzione dei responsabili delle agenzie fiscali alle norme sulla tracciabilit e alla rimessa in discussione dei provvedimenti di damiano per far uscire dallillegalit il lavoro sommerso e irregolare
944559 la crisi c ma di fronte al suo aggravarsi il governo ha messo in campo tagli alla spesa molto pesanti come raramente si fatto nel passato tagli che saranno destinati a creare effetti negativi sulla sanit a partire dal 2009 e sui bilanci delle regioni e dei comuni per di pi questi tagli sono indiscriminati spalmati su tutti i settori non hanno un segno di selezione in questo quadro si rinuncia a fare qualsiasi operazione anticiclica e di sviluppo penso ai tagli alle infrastrutture e a quelli in ricerca innovazione e formazione
944560 siamo al paradosso nel nome di una giusta battaglia contro chi nel pubblico impiego fa il furbo e si intervenuti dautorit per tagliare le retribuzioni dei lavoratori e sottrarre fondi alla contrattazione di secondo livello dai musei agli ospedali
944561 male con questo tasso dinflazione il drenaggio fiscale opera un aumento del prelievo superiore di mezzo punto allanno per i lavoratori dipendenti e quindi inevitabile che il carico fiscale del lavoro dipendente sia destinato a crescere per questanno e per lanno prossimo
944562 il governo bravo a camuffare parla di robin hood e ingenera lidea che c attenzione ai pi deboli in realt avviene il contrario si parla di social card ma nessuno dice che i pensionati hanno avuto un aumento del1 6 per cento mentre abbiamo uninflazione al 4 per cento la manovra in realt finisce per allargare le diseguaglianze affronta il problema degli ultimi con misure di tipo compassionevole come la social card e colpisce i redditi medi e medio bassi
944563 il quadro negativo la crescita poco pi di zero e c un elenco che si allunga di aziende in difficolt la cassa integrazione alla fiat quella pi visibile in un paese come il nostro quando la fiat va in difficolt ne risente tutta leconomia anche da questo punto di vista lautunno sar socialmente molto delicato in pi posizioni come quelle assunte dal governo di fronte ai problemi della precariet fanno capire che in questo quadro economico anche la precariet pu essere destinata a crescere
944564 ci siamo allenati molto duramente in italia per 40 giorni spiega barbolini al termine dellallenamento a pechino e abbiamo ottenuto anche un buon risultato con il bronzo nel world grand prix alle olimpiadi credo che bisogna guardare gara per gara cercheremo di arrivare tra le prime del girone e poi di arrivare tra le prime quattro dei giochi siamo abituati a giocare gare importanti e per questo non siamo affatto nervosi
944565 il nostro obiettivo di vincere una medaglia arrivare tra le prime tre dice lalzatrice eleonora lo bianco alla sua terza olimpiade e vero sentiamo un po la responsabilit perch abbiamo vinto molte partite lanno scorso ma noi vogliamo giocare senza questo peso qui dobbiamo giocare ogni gara come una finale ogni giorno abbiamo un match e ogni volta dobbiamo vincere ci siamo preparate sia fisicamente che tecnicamente abbiamo giocato contro tutti durante il grand prix siamo pronte a giocare

944579 so i was already beginning to move toward environmental activism
944580 and then i saw an inconvenient truth at the music hall
944581 as my husband and i walked home we said we knew we had to change our lives
944582 i could not believe id been intellectualizing the problem for so long i knew i had to do something
944583 because in 20 years our house could be under water but i said we have to stay and work here for me i knew right away it was going to take the form of activism
944584 this was an important step for me on my environmental journey
944585 andrew is not ideologically an environmentalist but he had a product that was sustainable
944586 the advocacy i had been doing was important but i was really tired of preaching to the choir
944587 i kept asking myself how i could reach people who dont identify as environmentalists
944588 hes probably the biggest author weve had in the store so far
944589 its the depth and uniqueness of the characters that drew me in
944590 i never used to read for pleasure but after reading his first book i was hooked
944591 preliminary contact by the legal department with one of the heirs of the original grantors suggest that the heirs may have no objection to the expansion of the middle school onto alumni field if there is adequate compensation in the form of new park and recreation lands to offset the loss
944592 the eminent domain process itself is designed to give sovereign bodies such as municipalities effective tools for acquiring property to serve the public good
944593 a public school is one of the most basic and recognizable forms of a public good and challenges would not have a high likelihood of success
944594 i think we have to look at it on a case by case basis
944595 it happens all the time like when you have to widen a road sometimes its an appropriate tool i think we need to look at every opportunity and make sure it is done in a manner that is good for the community
944596 im not surprised that people like me believed it was real its just incredibly sophisticated
944597 typically you get everything from grandmas 3 cup and saucer to rare things at 20 000 to 30 000 a number of years ago someone brought in a carved wooden eagle he got from a junk yard and put in his closet for 35 years it sold for 25 000
944598 people think somethings good or valuable and its not you see such a huge variety of things like late victorian paintings that were massed produced maybe theyre of no value
944599 they tell people to act excited on the show but once i had a lady who brought in a painting and i found a similar painting in an art record i told her it was worth 45 000 and she just said well thats nice she wasnt all that excited
944600 we anticipate a letdown in the upcoming fund raising campaign

944613 i soldati ha aggiunto alemanno si trovano in aree che non influenzano la vita quotidiana dei cittadini tra laltro a roma verranno utilizzati i lancieri di montebello e i granatieri di sardegna gia da tempo abituati a fare la guardia li vediamo ogni giorno davanti al quirinale allaltare della patria di fronte a tutti i luoghi istituzionali e sono perfettamente abituati al contatto con la citta sono da sempre i soldati di roma
944614 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
944615 the teams been revived i dont think it was a matter of anyone coming or anyone going
944616 hes done a great job playing great defense and getting on base
944617 thats why they brought him here they thought he could come out and help this team win and thats what hes doing
944618 one of the things we talked about was not looking back or looking forward just attacking whats at hand
944619 i think where were at right now we can be pretty darn good
944620 but we did get a few home runs here which weve been lacking
944621 he threw a 100 pitches in the first few innings
944622 we had a lot of guys on base but just didnt capitalize on it
944623 what a great tournament we got treated like royalty between the manchester host and babe ruth regional officials it was first class all the way and we were happy to get two wins and send two teams home
944624 were really impressed with that team our guys knew they were in for a battle today they have a lot of respect for those guys i didnt have to say a word to those guys to get them up for the game
944625 i thought we had potential but we got a lot farther than i thought we were going to get
944626 it was a slick field and derry is a good hitting team i told the kids 12 runs wouldnt hold up and we would have to probably score 20 to win
944627 the kids responded well we were kind of down after giving up those three runs but we responded with eight it was huge
944628 it was something ive been looking forward to for a long time its just good to get back out there and compete
944629 this is very important very important because were working hard for golf in argentina
944630 i had to leave the pit box i was afraid he was going to punch me in the neck
944631 carl said what would you do if you thought we would get the track cleaned off and keep running
944632 we argue we get mad we walk away and then we come back together and cooler heads prevail we have arguments and discussions but then we have handshakes and hugs and we come to terms with what we want to do ninety percent of the time it works out for us
944633 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
944634 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
944635 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
944636 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
944637 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
944638 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
944639 even though it feels like summer just started parents and kids are beginning to get ready for the upcoming school year
944640 i encourage everyone to support this terrific program and when shopping for your own children or grandchildren consider picking up an extra notebook or pack of pencils or crayons
944641 it will go a long way toward helping us fill these backpacks for children who really need them
944642 together we can make sure every child has the gear he or she needs to succeed in school
944643 as the pace of technology increases the amount of toxic electronic waste is piling up at home and abroad
944644 many americans are unaware that discarded electronics often contain lead mercury and other toxins and end up being salvaged under inhumane conditions in the developing world
944645 if the epa cannot or will not act to halt the toxic e waste trade to developing nations then congress should take action
944646 this resolution calling for a ban on the export of e waste to developing countries is a signal to the rest of the world that the u s government understands the environmental and personal devastation caused by sending our toxic electronic scrap to poor communities around the globe
944647 this resolution doesnt call for a ban on all exports just exports to the developing nations
944648 exporting e waste to the developed countries which have laws and governments that protect workers and the environment would still be allowed
944649 what would you like mce to be in five years
944650 yes no more sneaking a mce disc out of my msdn subscription for home
944651 oh man am i glad im not david fleischman because he is going to have to be that guy that puts this message in the os
944652 letting the user know if their machine is modern enough
944653 vista home ultimate allows your media center pc to record and view hd cable tv
944654 thar just mights be a future in them thar iphone apps
944655 what made me want to do this for tap tap tap
944656 i love manny hes always been one of my favorites and they kicked him out of town without even giving him a gift basket
944657 it may be summertime in maine but winter is on the mind of many maine people
944658 it is time we begin working together to do what we can before the temperature drops
944659 i know we are in serious trouble this winter especially for the elderly
944660 we have to do something to help these people out
944661 its definitely frustrating when the team is having such a good season and youre not really part of it
944662 its a little tougher since wes came back but i think ive competed pretty well
944663 welker and moss are two different kinds of players with randy outside and wes in the slot but they both run great routes and you can learn a lot watching them
944664 the coaches havent told me anything but i am listed on the depth chart for both punts and kickoffs
944665 i want to get out there catch a ball and run with it
944666 sometimes it feels like i havent done that since college
944667 i got a fantastic buy its in move in condition
944668 it was the wrong time to have it on the market
944669 as one of the first companies to obtain epa approval to make claims against the h5n1 bird flu virus lonza continues to lead the way in meeting the markets need for disinfectants that are proven effective against dangerous pathogens such as h5n1
944670 these formulations can be diluted on site and applied to hard non porous surfaces using a variety of application techniques e g spraying mop and bucket etc as described in the label instructions
944671 technically speaking these formulations inactivate the virus by denaturing cell proteins and disrupting the viral membrane
944672 our efforts were stepped up in march of 2006 in response to the pandemic in asia
944673 we began our initial tests which were followed by efforts to seek approvals from the u s epa regarding the use of our formulas to combat the h5n1 virus
944674 in this case we were struck by the fact that carol pugh of greenland has a history of abusing animals and we think its particularly important that animals be shielded from that
944675 law enforcement gets discretion and its entirely their decision but given the history i hope the judge will decide the dog should be confiscated
944676 if shes found guilty i strongly urge the judge to not allow her to own any more animals
944677 seventy percent of animal abusers commit other crimes from murder to trafficking in drugs and firearms offenses in 1986 only four states had felony animal abuse laws today there are only five that dont arkansas mississippi idaho north dakota and south dakota we hope to have that remedied in the 2009 legislative session
944678 a prosecutor might think the burden of proof is too high to meet a felony charge or there could be other mitigating circumstances
944679 i was concerned at the three eighths pole and i thought we were beat turning for home
944680 but he got down on his belly and he won
944681 he found a new gear and just kept sticking his neck out
944682 at the top of the stretch that horse took off but big brown just kept coming and i knew wed get him at the three sixteenths pole he switched leads and then at the eighth pole he took off again
944683 he showed his heart and courage which was a side of him i hadnt seen until today
944684 its very rough when things go right for you and you dont get the win
944685 big brown always won his other races with such ease
944686 its been about 60 days of nervousness i had a dream last night that he won but this race was a lot closer than the one in my dream were thrilled
944687 if it was up to me i wouldnt run him back so quick
944688 i do wish there were cheaper extender dvd player combos
944689 youre getting it free if youre buying a new pc
944690 mce works pretty well with digital terrestrial but thats the group of users who have opted out of paying for tv
944691 hey 2 new channels launched last week in the uk
944692 you just keep thinking butch thats what youre good at
944693 chicken of the sea is it fish or is it tuna
944694 mi objetivo en beijing es meterme entre los 10 primeros no descarto llegar hasta la final en alg n aparato bien sean las barras paralelas las anillas la barra fija o los arzones
944695 estar all me ha dado la posibilidad de competir m s y codearme m s seguido con los mejores gimnastas del mundo as uno va aprendiendo secretos del deporte y perfeccionado detalles de sus presentaciones
944696 los juegos ol mpicos no se pueden comparar con ning n otro evento el entorno es impresionante y realmente a uno lo intimida por eso creo que la experiencia me ayudar a asimilar todo mejor y a no desconcentrarme
944697 fue muy bueno trabajar con ellos porque tratar n de vencer a los chinos que son los favoritos yo estoy mejorando mis rutinas y estabiliz ndolas para la competencia oficial la verdad es que me siento muy optimista
944698 ella ya gan un oro participar en unos ol mpicos con apenas 16 a os es un logro inmenso seguramente los resultados no se ver n de inmediato pero a futuro seguramente esa experiencia le reportar muchas medallas a colombia en competencias internacionales ella tiene muchas condiciones y una buena mentalidad adem s los viajes y las competencias la est n ayudando a madurar tiene un gran presente pero un mejor futuro
944699 the best part is seeing them all together again playing and having a good time
944700 when i started selling puppies i told each of the owners i would like to check back in and throw a little reunion
944701 i thought it sounded unusual but also a lot of fun
944702 we just wanted to see what the rest of the pups looked like its great that we can all keep in touch

944721 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it

944735 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
944736 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
944737 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
944738 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
944739 theyve taken a loophole in the law and with 15 people they have managed to establish themselves as a fringe party whose sole purpose is to confuse voters that democrats have support from a phantom party
944740 water infiltrating the concrete slabs freezes and then thaws weakening the concrete and rusting the steel
944741 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
944742 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
944743 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
944744 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
944745 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
944746 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
944747 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
944748 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
944749 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
944750 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
944751 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
944752 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
944753 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
944754 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
944755 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
944756 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
944757 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
944758 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
944759 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
944760 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
944761 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
944762 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
944763 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
944764 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
944765 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
944766 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
944767 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
944768 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
944769 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
944770 les hommes politiques qui sont d j sous pression simaginent quavec ces nouveaux moyens de communication ils vont chapper la tyrannie journalistique et instaurer un lien direct avec le public
944771 anyone can make a baby but not everyone can be a parent
944772 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
944773 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
944774 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
944775 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
944776 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
944777 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
944778 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
944779 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
944780 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
944781 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
944782 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
944783 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
944784 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
944785 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
944786 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
944787 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
944788 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
944789 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
944790 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
944791 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
944792 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
944793 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
944794 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
944795 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
944796 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
944797 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
944798 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
944799 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
944800 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
944801 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
944802 some obama backers are right to worry that the relentless daily attacks on the candidate will take their toll on the campaign
944803 its time for the obama campaign to build a political firewall by using outside surrogates unaffiliated with the candidate to debunk these misleading attacks
944804 what we have learnt this week is that when the republican attack machine cranks up as hillary clinton predicted obama is actually pretty vulnerable
944805 obama will put his face on the 100 bill mccain w video
944806 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
944807 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
944808 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
944809 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
944810 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
944811 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
944812 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
944813 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
944814 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
944815 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
944816 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
944817 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
944818 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
944819 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
944820 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
944821 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
944822 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
944823 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
944824 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
944825 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
944826 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
944827 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
944828 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
944829 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
944830 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
944831 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
944832 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
944833 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
944834 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
944835 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
944836 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
944837 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
944838 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
944839 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
944840 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
944841 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
944842 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
944843 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
944844 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
944845 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
944846 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
944847 a political promise to do something 40 years from now
944848 because everyone knows thats meaningless ten years is about the maximum time that we as a nation can hold a steady aim and hit the target
944849 are the very same measures needed to renew our economy
944850 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
944851 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
944852 in one month than an average american family uses in an entire year
944853 burned through enough electricity to power 232 average american households for a month
944854 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
944855 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
944856 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
944857 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
944858 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
944859 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
944860 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
944861 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
944862 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
944863 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
944864 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
944865 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
944866 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
944867 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
944868 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
944869 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
944870 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
944871 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
944872 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
944873 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
944874 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
944875 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
944876 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
944877 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
944878 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
944879 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
944880 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
944881 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
944882 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
944883 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
944884 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
944885 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
944886 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
944887 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
944888 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
944889 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
944890 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
944891 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
944892 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
944893 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
944894 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
944895 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
944896 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
944897 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
944898 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
944899 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
944900 in the wake of 9 11 my meetings with arab and pakistani americans have a more urgent quality for the stories of detentions and fbi questioning and hard stares from neighbors have shaken their sense of security and belonging
944901 i will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction
944902 gore new yorker cover way too far over the top
944903 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
944904 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
944905 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
944906 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
944907 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
944908 i heard people say that they didnt have a right to vote from abroad
944909 a vote is a vote regardless of where you are for anyone who says they dont have a right to vote you do
944910 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
944911 i do think theres an opportunity for us to shine a light on some of those questions
944912 i think youll see that we will answer the call
944913 when theres news we will deal with the issues as they come
944914 we arent going to go there as the guests of the chinese government and deliberately poke sharp sticks in their eyes
944915 were not going to go out of our way to do it but we think there are going to be a lot of opportunities to bring the subject up based on the events of the day
944916 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing
944917 if al gore is upset about carbon we must need more of it
944918 my bet would be on policy decision as usual however
944919 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
944920 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
944921 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
944922 you know its not about you its about your country
944923 steve has a twinge in his back which is why we rested him
944924 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
944925 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
944926 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
944927 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
944928 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
944929 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
944930 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
944931 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
944932 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
944933 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
944934 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
944935 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
944936 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
944937 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
944938 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
944939 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
944940 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
944941 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
944942 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
944943 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
944944 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
944945 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
944946 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
944947 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
944948 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
944949 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
944950 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
944951 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
944952 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
944953 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
944954 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
944955 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
944956 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
944957 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
944958 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
944959 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
944960 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
944961 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
944962 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
944963 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
944964 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
944965 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
944966 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
944967 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
944968 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
944969 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
944970 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
944971 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
944972 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
944973 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
944974 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
944975 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
944976 dr zawahiri was enjoying a meal when the earth suddenly heated up by several thousand degrees
944977 the way it happened makes al gore look like a prophet
944978 but i resent when you throw out stupid allegations that have no merit and really no purpose other than to inflame
944979 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father rom 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body rom 9 4 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises gal 4 5 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons eph 1 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will

944992 i would never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels
944993 it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
944994 you know i have been very clear in my denunciation of minister farrakhans anti semitic comments i think they are unacceptable and reprehensible i did not solicit this support he expressed pride in an african american who seems to be bringing the country together i obviously cant censor him but it is not support that i sought and were not doing anything i assure you formally or informally with minister farrakhan
944995 but if the word reject sen clinton feels is stronger than the word denounce then im happy to concede the point and i would reject and denounce
944996 if you lie with dogs you are going to get fleas

944998 bill ayres thought he and barry were friends and the wives were friendly too but they werent prepared for that big ol bus that runs right over you

945000 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
945001 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
945002 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
945003 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
945004 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
945005 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
945006 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
945007 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
945008 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
945009 can you please tell me what the lottery numbers will be in the next drawing
945010 i came up with one more energy related prediction the greatest self propelled vehicle ever invented the bicycle will experience a major renaissance

945019 we are iraqis and you shouldnt say such a thing

945022 i was watching these guys punt and i would not have said kevin huber is the backup
945023 knowing he was an underclassman who was mechanically a little better than the starter we gave him an opportunity in the bowl game to punt
945024 he understands the importance of the punt in the flow of the game
945025 he can directional punt right or left wherever we need it to go hes got a very powerful leg hes a weapon for our team to change field position
945026 when he walked on the field you werent just getting a guy back there who was just punting the football
945027 when we had the situation where we needed to fake we were confident with the ball in his hands and he could catch the ball
945028 when it got down to it he said i can punt in division i and thats what i want to do
945029 i asked him a lot of questions and he gave me some great punting tips that made me the punter i was last year
945030 talent wise hes as good as anybody ive had as a sophomore going into their junior year
945031 hes extremely quick and very strong in the hips similar to a baseball player with a short powerful swing he showed up with that were trying to refine it so its consistent
945032 i didnt know what it was going to take mentally at the college level

945048 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
945049 after an exhaustive review of a substantial body of climate research and in conjunction with the obvious and compelling new evidence that exists it is time that the world community acknowledges that the earth has begun its next climate change in an opinion echoed by many scientists around the world the space and science research center ssrc today declares that the worlds climate warming of the past decades has now come to an end a new climate era has already started that is bringing predominantly colder global temperatures for many years into the future in some years this new climate will create dangerously cold weather with significant ill effects world wide global warming is over a new cold climate has begun
945050 as a dissenting physicist i simply can no longer buy the notion that co2 produces any significant warming of the atmosphere at any rate

945060 so anyways this is als crowd because of course he invented the internet
945061 our favorite question if meat causes more carbon emissions than cars what should we do
945062 its outright pathetic to see so many comments attacking the messenger rather than debating the ideas
945063 you dont see where all the carbon goes so there is a misconception that woody species such as trees and shrubs store more carbon thats just not the case

945070 most sober observers of world affairs are not likely to fall under his spell example sovietologist richard lowenthal has sorrowfully expressed his amazement at solzhenitsyns utter disaccord with the facts of recent international history lowenthal points out that not all defeats for the west as for instance in indochina are caused by surrender but can be the result of local forces
945071 as a prophet he has a vision so simple single minded and absolute that it cannot cope with a real and complex world
945072 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
945073 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
945074 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
945075 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
945076 but you can put it on the agenda and try to move the country

945078 what a great big long grand x you have dear n
945079 and the quickest and easiest way to back out the coal which is the worst of the problem and oil is to look at electricity generation
945080 i also think that the coal and oil industries can play a big role in this if they will make good on the promise that carbon capture and sequestration will be real
945081 first canis focaccia no cheese is italian pizza is american
945082 america is a deeply racist society and whites are to blame for all of the social problems befalling blacks
945083 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
945084 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
945085 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
945086 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
945087 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on

945154 marriages in these tribal families used to take place girls used to get married even wen they had just stepped into their teens now in some villages around the district these tribals have planned not to get their girls married before the age of 18 years and also ensure that they visit the local maternity hospital right from the time of advanced stage of pregnancy to labour pains for proper pre natal and post natal care so it is a good message that is spreading in the nearby villages

945188 t o use or rather to misuse the term war is not simply a matter of legality or pedantic semantics it has deeper and more dangerous consequences to declare that one is at war is immediately to create a war psychosis that may be totally counter productive for the objective that we seek it will arouse an immediate expectation and demand for spectacular military action against some easily identifiable adversary preferably a hostile state action leading to decisive results
945189 i want to say one other challenge that we face is simply that we must find an alternative to war and bloodshed anyone who feels and there are still a lot of people who feel that way that war can solve the social problems facing mankind is sleeping through a great revolution

945216 according to vedanta there are only five reasons why humans suffer the first is not knowing who we are the second is identifying with our ego or self image the third is clinging to that which is transient and unreal the fourth is recoiling in fear of that which is transient and unreal and the fifth is the fear of death vedanta also says that the five causes of suffering are all contained in the first cause not knowing who we are if we can answer this one basic question who am i we may find the answer to all other related questions such as where did i come from what is the meaning and purpose of my life where do i go when i die

945261 esta iniciativa adoptada por unha consellar a do bng permit unos co ecer o n vel real de demanda de vivenda protexida en toda galiza e que concretamente en ponteareas esa demanda ascende a 481 persoas
945262 estamos diante dun grave e preocupante problema pois case medio milleiro de familias na nosa localidade precisan unha vivenda protexida e a pesares da vontade do bng desde a xunta ponteareas est quedando fora dos investimentos en vivenda protexida que executa a consellar a de vivenda en toda galiza porque solla e castro non foron capaces nestes tres anos de po er terreos a disposici n da xunta
945263 pouco despois de que o bng asumise o goberno galego solla entrevistouse coa conselleira teresa t boas e esta ofreceuse como o propio solla reco eceu nos medios de comunicaci n a facer vivenda protexida en ponteareas unha vez que o goberno local cedese os terreos como legalmente est establecido
945264 nestes tres anos o goberno do pp dirixido por solla e castro en ning n momento solicitou xunta facer vivenda protexida en ponteareas nin ofreceu terreos para esa finalidade
945265 estamos diante dun novo exemplo da incapacidade do pp en ponteareas para atender as necesidades de centos de veci os e veci as a xunta est agardando desde hai tres anos para facer vivenda en ponteareas onde non se fai vivenda protexida p blica desde hai case 15 anos pero o goberno de solla e castro siguen cruzados de brazos e a nda por enriba ad canse a criticar ao goberno galego
945266 desm ntense desta maneira as voces politicamente interesadas que negaban da vontade do ministerio de fomento de dotar a ponteareas deste importante elemento de seguridade vial que constit e a terceira rotonda na n 120 seu paso polo casco urbano de ponteareas

945431 this is a reflection of the nature of the illness that can reoccur in some patients for several months depending on the patients primary condition and whether there is a need to prescribe further antibiotic treatment

945452 obviously spore comes from a very strong pedigree and the title itself looks dynamic
945453 certainly the expectations are very high sales of several million units but i wouldnt put it in the realm of
945454 i think they dont need to appeal to anybody outside the hardcore wright and sims fans
945455 needs to sell in the millions and last a few years to pay back the investment but you know we were probably going to spend the money on something it might as well be on spore
945456 we dont provide financial breakouts for individual titles or any formulas we use in determining financial performance
945457 that said i can tell you that no one at ea is measuring spore with the yardstick created by the sims theyre two totally different animals spore is a game that has a lot to offer players long after they make the original purchase a much different business model than traditional video games
945458 while its important to have an actual game within the game
945459 i think gamers are so fascinated already with the creature creator and the ability to make buildings and spaceships that their expectations are going to be a lot lower than what ea would need in another game
945460 i think part of it will result from word of mouth and viral marketing
945461 is it something that people want to talk to their friends about friends and family taking notice and saying gee i want to do that as well its a little bit premature to say definitively whether spore will do that or not

945466 gay political story of 2008 there always is id rather be pro active this time
945467 if obama picks nunn as his running mate it will cause widespread disillusionment with gay democrats and independents it is crucial to remember that supporters are more pro obama than anti mccain choosing nunn diminishes this palpable excitement and looks like politics as usual opening a door for mccain to increase his share of the glbt vote if obama picks nunn while at the same time mccain picks a moderate vp candidate i estimate that the gay vote for mccain will hover between 35 40 it is key that obama avoid falling into this trap if mccain picks a huckabee romney type however it would neutralize this advantage
945468 our industry right now is hungry for another round of innovation
945469 64 bit versions of windows will begin to find their way into high end gaming notebooks which increasingly are being used as high end notebook workstations as opposed to strictly gaming systems
945470 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
945471 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops

945508 there is a human resource crisis in our specialty all across canada
945509 this problem has been in newfoundland but it may happen in other provinces
945510 we anticipate that unless this issue is addressed and theres a framework in the federal scene that were going to see this more and more you cant just address this province by province
945511 i can tell you providing a system in which an individuals professional goals can be reached providing high quality care will prevent a disaster

945516 when you net 30 goals in a season a lot of clubs come looking for you but this club is one of the biggest in the world and i have a big chance to have a good career at this club
945517 when there is a lot of speculation they the fans believe what they read in the newspapers the most important thing is to keep on enjoying your football
945518 he felt people questioned his commitment and the best answer you can give to that is on the pitch
945519 play well and show you are ready to fight for the shirt he does that and he is a man with character if you score goals then people forget quickly

945536 in other words as long as the rule that only my code does db access is preserved the caching gives a massive perf improvement and guarantees correct results
945537 all youre really saying is that in order for caching to give a boost in performance it must be done correctly and the situation must be one that can benefit
945538 no the point of my article is that claiming a cache boosts performance isnt a term you can use in a generic way
945539 you have to precisely define whats the situation your app is in its otherwise a moot claim
945540 why a cache in an o r mapper doesnt make it fetch data faster
945541 simply because your narrow situation in which caching does work doesnt scale up as soon as you use a webfarm your caching scheme isnt working anymore
945542 with plinq effectively you write the code the same way but we arrange for it to run on multiple cpus
945543 so the queries get split up and run on multiple cpus and then you just wait for all the results to arrive and lo and behold without any changes your program just ran six times faster its instant gratification
945544 give us a chance to show how badly we want something

945555 its important that you deliver your code on january 30 so we can meet our launch date deliver on our promise to our customers and then celebrate during our launch party
945556 maybe they are saying something to me that im not hearing
945557 he nodded and said something brief but profound good story but its hard to look smart with bad numbers
945558 i have used the skills learned in class in fact my team is hosting our quarterly departmental meeting on friday and i again plan on using your techniques i have taken several courses through oracle university and i can honestly say that yours was the most exciting and challenging of them all thank you
945559 presentations whether one on one meetings or speaking before a huge audience can drive fear to exquisitely high levels some fear is useful it forces you to take time out of your crammed schedule to prepare the presentation but when fear crosses the line from excitement to dread it can impair concentration and kill energy it can negatively affect that carefully crafted speech and make you swear off presentations forever which would be a shame few skills will propel your career faster than the ability to speak in public we help people overcome the fear of public speaking
945560 our work has to be experienced to truly understand its value we use these workshops as a way to introduce our work experientially to new prospective clients with that in mind we set aside a couple of free seats for the right candidates

945567 lignite and hard coal energy suppliers for world needs until the year 2100 an outlook
945568 i t is important to estimate expected atmospheric co 2 levels for realistic estimates of fossil fuel reserves and to determine how the co 2 level depends upon possible constraints on coal use
945569 implications of peak oil for atmospheric co 2 and climate
945570 peak oil emission occurs in 2016 2 yr peak gas in 2026 2 yr and peak coal in 2077 2 yr
945571 is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their co 2 emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions
945572 e ven if coal reserves are much lower than historically assumed there is surely enough coal to take the world past 450 ppm co 2 without mitigation efforts such as those described here
945573 our producer limited profile has future fossil fuel production that is lower than all 40 of the ipcc scenarios so it seems that producer limitations could provide useful constraints in climate modeling
945574 the producer limited profile gives a peak of 460 ppm in 2070
945575 no lo s honestamente no he hablado con ella en a os

945587 right now we want residents in travel trailers to have a more permanent residence to go to if necessary
945588 if people see water in the roadway they should not drive through because it would probably be saltwater and damage their vehicle
945589 currently we have about 400 people on site with income generated to local labour at about r4 5 million that has been spent to date
945590 we are upgrading the stadium to 45 000 with the main construction on the western pavilion where we are going up with an additional tier which will accommodate the additional seating
945591 the main frames are being constructed and once that has been completed the pre cast seats which will be installed
945592 we have had a certain amount of labour related issues
945593 there was what we call an illegal strike for 15 days on and off not over one period but the contractor has mitigated against that and have come to an agreement between the labour force and themselves and to date we have had no other labour related issues
945594 however there is no doubt that mangaung will complete the stadium ahead of the fifa deadline of december 2008
945595 we have on site 400 people and of those people about 85 percent are local the other 15 percent comes from outside because they offer specialised services which were not available at the time when the contract was awarded
945596 through the project that we have to implement we have tried to ensure that we involved as many local people as possible including local companies
945597 we will try to ensure we continue with this policy
945598 this has seen the number of beds in the city rise to 10 884 by june 2008
945599 the strategy for reaching the accommodation target number of beds in the city is to work with satellite towns such as kimberley upington maseru in lesotho and other towns in the free state province have become key in terms of meeting the accommodation inventory target
945600 for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed

945603 were all very shocked by the timing its a very sad day for family and for braves fans i think the braves fans feel theyre part of skips family

945635 im still a mess all my life i wanted to be an olympian and i made the team and then i come up positive in a drug test even though ive never taken an illegal drug in my life at least not knowingly and now im not on the team any longer
945636 i prepared myself on how id handle it if i didnt make the team but i didnt prepare myself for the emotions im now feeling for what has happened to me i just feel so empty and stunned and powerless
945637 i actually ate some ice cream at cold stone in seal beach that was covered with brownies marshmallow and coconut
945638 we eventually hope to find the reasons for an illegal drug clenbuterol winding up in her system
945639 what happened to me could have happened to anyone on the olympic swimming team
945640 im not going to take this lying down its not fair what happened to me the pain the heartache the grief it has caused me is unbelievable
945641 ive worked so much of my life to make the olympics and i did and this happens its just not fair that an innocent person is made to suffer like this obviously something i consumed was tainted i dont know for sure what it was but were eventually going to find out and someones going to pay
945642 we dont know if the cause was sabotage contaminated food or bad supplements
945643 were getting out of town but dont yet know where
945644 we have timeshares all over the world we havent yet made up our mind where were going we havent even yet canceled our hotel accommodations in beijing or even our flight to beijing
945645 what has happened to jessica is not something weve planned for
945646 there have been so many emotional swings for a while we had hope but then there wasnt any and what makes it so hard is you know jessica didnt do anything wrong thats hard to live with
945647 i know this is going to be tough for me for a long time
945648 im prepared to go on im convinced what ive gone through is going to make me even stronger

945653 vietnam is heavy with jungles so it was hard to tell how many bodies were out there laying around
945654 my older brother was in the navy and i wanted to go too
945655 i thought there were better opportunities and more schools you could be sent to in the navy
945656 i thought what in the world are they seabees but i soon learned they are a good outfit
945657 we were builders carpenters electricians and steelworkers you name it we built it
945658 all i knew about vietnam was that it was a place that war had been going on for hundreds of years
945659 the japanese were there then the french and then us i was a little bit scared and apprehensive about what i was going to get into
945660 it was for all the bases incoming food that needed refrigerated it wasnt like the size of a room it was big enough to accommodated food for all the troops in south vietnam
945661 we were basically building shops that the south vietnam people could come in and set up
945662 a lot of times wed be working on a project and the north vietnamese or the viet cong were keeping an eye on us and when we got done theyd blow it up
945663 when north vietnam finally took over the south im sure they killed every one of them who was fighting against them in the south vietnamese army
945664 they were the type of people that wanted you to fight for them or else
945665 there was all kinds of tracer fire coming through camp that night
945666 the second time was easier because i knew something about it
945667 they were going way up in the mountains to try and drive a battalion of north vietnamese out
945668 in the evening when we were off we could see their fire fights way off in the distance
945669 we worked 16 18 hour days and then on sunday we worked eight or nine hours sunday felt like a day off and we couldnt wait for it to come
945670 i missed my family a lot but you didnt have time to think about it
945671 you were so tired when you were done working that you just wanted to try and get a little bit of rest
945672 you never knew if one of them the peasants were going to have a bomb or grenade strapped to them
945673 keno is especially a bad form of gambling in large part because it takes place mainly in drinking establishments
945674 the governor should be ashamed of himself for putting state spending ahead of the good of ohioans
945675 what jay and i hoped to do is to get kids from our local school interested
945676 the idea is to get more art in the schools to connect with other artists we also wanted to incorporate an internship program to help develop leadership skills
945677 i helped the kids get ideas for their scarecrows and get materials
945678 this has been a wonderful opportunity for maddie to do something she cant do in a school setting
945679 this really extended her out because it took her from the paper drawing to an actual three dimensional object and for her to actually construct and assemble
945680 annie was one of my students and approached me about making the empty field into a sculpture garden
945681 this was a dream i had several years ago when i was in europe
945682 someday we hope to have sculptures made of recycled metal material
945683 from what we did today i hope the children learn they dont have to starve to be artists what alone is junk can be used to make art
945684 the class was great for building self esteem finding his strengths and being able to express himself through his art
945685 whats some way you can bring happiness in your life for less
945686 dont go shopping so you wont see things you want
945687 we learned to recycle and got to see llamas chickens and goats
945688 it took me a while to catch on but ive been having fun ever since i did
945689 when im not here they miss me and my dance
945690 tuesday i had nine strikes in a row and three weeks ago i had 10
945691 we got it through a grant that debi smith supportive services director wrote
945692 it gets them up and moving they the seniors arent just sitting when theyre here they have a very active lifestyle
945693 they started and went crazy with creating their own leagues and tournaments
945694 you can hear them over here laughing clapping and high fiving each other
945695 they asked me to come play and i told them i couldnt
945696 when i played in a bowling league in the past i got gutter balls all the time but i dont think ive gotten one since i started playing on the wii
945697 we love to do it and just scream and holler and have a good time
945698 we have a ball and it beats sitting at home in a rocking chair
945699 for me its not all about the hunt but the time i spend with god
945700 he has loved the outdoors his whole life and has been a missionary at heart it was time to bring those two together
945701 these celebration services will include testimonies worship and equipping my continued prayer is that each outpost will grow and reproduce becoming a multi church planting movement
945702 what we are trying to do is merge people who love the outdoors with those who want to worship
945703 we want to focus on the family its not just for men who hunt but for women and children who love outdoor activities
945704 we feel that the lord brought us together with jeff and kim we have so many similar interests and enjoy being with one another
945705 the state fair is a wonderful opportunity to educate people
945706 we hope people will start seeing this as a traditional way of doing business
945707 the third largest type of waste we get at the land fill is food waste
945708 and we want to reduce the waste going into the landfill
945709 so i felt i was able to pitch well overall if possible i wanted to keep throwing into the seventh inning but with the rain and everything even if i were able to stay in the game that would have been the end to my start and i just wanted to focus on going deep into the game in my next start
945710 i feel like ive been here three weeks not just three days
945711 now it will be a little bit of normalcy if you will
945712 ive read that red sox nation travels well but on the road youre a bit more tighter knit and you get to know the guys and im looking forward to it
945713 its something im not really used to thats for sure
945714 ive been told that red sox nation is different from everywhere else and in a good way now ive seen it first hand it was amazing a whirlwind i couldnt have scripted it any better its been very nice
945715 to come here and we get three wins and to play behind some starting pitching that gives up five runs in three games thats fun to play behind
945716 there was no doubt in my mind it was coming from that room

945725 but the only excursions offered were to the local mall where a wealth of unaffordable merchandise stared them in the face
945726 we always knew not to call the law unless you were prepared to be unemployed

945728 community marketing ist ein fester bestandteil im marketing mix von mini
945729 handmade violins to the untrained eye they look all the same
945730 but every violin has its own personality and theyre all very very different
945731 and theres more and more musicians who are finding that the quality of new violins compete pretty favorably with the old instruments especially considering the price
945732 if you are doing this to eat you better be able to do it that fast
945733 knowing that im building something that might be around in 300 years is kind of cool
945734 its neat knowing that if your instruments are good people will play them and search for them
945735 most people say a violin is violin but there are so many details that set a maker apart
945736 you have to do all the work and get your work out there and get your instruments out there and get them played
945737 right now we want residents in travel trailers to have a more permanent residence to go to if necessary
945738 if people see water in the roadway they should not drive through because it would probably be saltwater and damage their vehicle
945739 well look at their public transportation getting in and out of facilities security and things like that
945740 i dont think politics should ever interfere with arts or sports

945745 roy is not going to sign a new contract because he hasnt been offered one yet

945755 nobody wants to be freezing their tits off on an icy windswept pitch in january when they could be in hong kong or sydney or florida we cant stand still we must find new and more ridiculous ways to entirely diminish the credibility of the english game and flog it off to the highest and most gullible bidder i mean who wouldnt pay 10 million to watch hull city vs stoke on a patch of wasteland in harare

945757 wir liegen mittlerweile weltweit bei rund 1 000 installationen t glich das beweist dass unternehmen aller gr en und aller branchen nach alternativen zu san l sungen suchen und dabei immer fter drbd finden tats chlich ist drbd f r alle linux server die einzige software basierte high availability alternative zu den etablierten hardware l sungen

945785 weve tried to become a deep football team and right now were very competitive

945788 we had hardy nickerson in here one time and shelton quarles did a great job shelton was a great mentor for two years and now barrett took over last year hes like the quarterback on defense

945790 hes a heck of a football player and he loves football hes got a great attitude

945819 i cant see any relevance youre telling us to stop after passing a law on armm providing for elections there should be a certain degree of stability in legislation
945820 be careful with this issue the christians in mindanao are a factor to be considered this is not an easy problem for you to handle
945821 with or without the elections i dont think you can shorten the peace process the problems you have to hurdle are too immense

945823 he said he felt good this is the first step just the fact that he felt good throwing and didnt have any discomfort thats a great sign
945824 just hit the glove and get used to throwing again
945825 hes been doing a lot of shoulder conditioning a lot of stuff in the weight room a lot of core work and a lot of leg work hes working probably two to three hours per day doing a lot of different things

945829 if you think about how an operating system is loaded
945830 its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine
945831 the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
945832 midori is one of many incubation projects underway at microsoft its simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it
945833 the real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing
945834 within the microsoft environment we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others
945835 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
945836 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
945837 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
945838 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
945839 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
945840 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold
945841 thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get
945842 if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money
945843 when you got the job when you were told that you were going to be on 208 it was the holy grail as far as i was concerned

945845 he hides the ball well and comes right after you when hes throwing 94 95 mph it looks more like 96 97 mph and when hes got the split finger working man
945846 i know once they think im good to go they want to send brandon morrow out and make a starting pitcher out of him
945847 and jim riggleman is managing for a job hes got to be sure i give us the best chance to win a game before he changes brandons role
945848 we need to see j j pitch back to back games see him come in and take control of the game again

945897 allergy cannot be ruled out because there is no history of hay fever asthma or eczema
945898 people who are observant enough to realize that when they eat beef they become bloated or when they eat chicken they get diarrhea or when they eat honeydew melon they get sore throat and their own experience may take them more sympathetic and supportive than other doctors
945899 if what the clinical ecologists are saying is true its going to have a very significant impact on medicine in general and allergy in particular
945900 is pay very close attention to his or her body for a period of time a week or a month or whatever try to see if theres any health problem that can be related to certain foods or anything else in his or her daily life
945901 if you feel fine only when youre away from home and worse within several hours after you return chances are that something in your house is causing the problem on the other hand if you feel fine at home but ill at work at school or when traveling thats a sign that youre sensitive to something outside the home if allergic symptoms are unrelated to where you are and never disappear with change of location you may have a food allergy that is particularly true if youve had the allergy since infancy
945902 one way to approach an unknown food allergy is to eliminate a suspected food for a period of several days and then reintroduce it in large amounts for a day and see what happens
945903 those with allergies outside the home usually experience a worsening of symptoms during the warm month of the year indicating a sensitivity to pollen or mold
945904 also if you smell chemicals before other and either detest or crave the odor it may indicate a chemical sensitivity
945905 allegies sometimes can be relieved entirely or in part within one to two weeks by making changes in a persons home or by altering whats eaten
945906 some authorities claim that a good history and careful skin testing are reliable 95 percent of the time in allergy diagnosis
945907 in many instances it is clear that result are not that good because too many patients are incorrectly diagnosed as sensitized to various allergens and inappropriately given immunotherapy because skin testing uses unstandardized antigens testing techniques and scoring systems it is to be expected that misinformation commonly is obtained
945908 skin testing in the diagnosis of allergic disease is in reality not a uniform technique comparably practiced by all
945909 undoubtedly thousands of persons are receiving allergy shots on the basis of skin tests that were incorrectly performed or erroneously interpreted or both

945917 between june 1979 and march 1980 short term interest rates rose by over six percentage points from 9 06 percent to 15 2 percent in 1981 and 1982 combined the s amp l industry collectively reported almost 9 billion in losses worse in mid 1982 all s amp ls combined had a negative net worth valuing their mortgages on a market value basis of 100 billion an amount equal to 15 percent of the industrys liabilities

945919 the demand for it professionals with virtualization skills is growing and we think that it wont take long for demand to start rising in the asia pacific region
945920 their returns on investment are the quickest with lower capital outlay and equal or higher returns hosting service providers will benefit as well
945921 the number of professionals with skills in this specialized area needs to increase in order to meet future labor demands in the region
945922 this may impact the virtual infrastructure performance and ability to perform
945923 we need a new group of professionals who are able to design new kinds of architectures master new tools and interpret the results they need to be comfortable with high availability solutions and know what impact each approach will have on the network operating system or application level in the virtual data center

945963 if we had a contest of the kind we saw in london with boris and ken and so on if something like that could be replicated in the valleys it would give a new impetus to the need for change
945964 delivery mechanism to make these things happen which is effective
945965 the challenge is whether the heads of the valleys or the valleys feel they have enough in common to embrace this idea in the past theres been a lot of competition between areas in the valleys
945966 some people might question whether the notion of a mayor which has traditionally been thought of as for a city or a town can be applied to a region like the valleys but that is the interest
945967 i am happy to take a second place in race two because in the first race my rear tyre choice was not so good and i was disappointed with that in the second race i just changed the rear tyre and i had a good feeling with that one i had a good battle with kiyo but he was faster than me in some places then i would catch him up congratulations to kiyo and also my team because they made a good job to allow me to finish second
945968 race two was better than the first race we made some changes to the tyre choice and the bike and they worked well i just could not run the pace of the guys at the front because they just pulled away i had a bit of a battle with bayliss and it took a bit of time for me to get past him but i am content with third im out there trying to win races but podiums will have to do for now

946002 if we are to truly retire the politics of the past and defeat republican carol schwartz then we must look long and hard and act prudently strategically i no longer believe that my candidacy will bring about ms schwartzs retirement from the council it will take all of us uniting behind one independent to accomplish this and that is why today i ended my candidacy and endorsed michael brown

946057 while he was downstairs ostensibly looking for something he ran out this kid just managed to trick us

946073 but an automobile was approaching on k street he just kept going his bumper run under me and i did a maneuver i rolled across his

946123 we can see people reluctant to spend more time because it is costing them money to do so
946124 unfortunately we have not been able to sustain as many full time employees as we used to

946130 inoltre la limitazione delle assunzioni di personale a tempo indeterminato al 20 del turn over dannegger gravemente la funzionalit scientifica e didattica degli atenei
946131 e le prime vittime si sottolinea da parte della crui sarebbero i giovani ricercatori le cui possibilit di ingresso nel sistema universitario verrebbero drasticamente ridotte
946132 che si possa affrontare responsabilmente un tema centrale e di valenza strategica per la vita del paese come quello di una eventuale revisione istituzionale e organizzativa del sistema universitario sotto la minaccia del suo tracollo annunciato e inevitabile

946141 by 2010 we are seeking to achieve group operating earnings of more than 3bn we want to achieve a return on capital employed our key performance indicator of at least 13 by 2010
946142 a performance where we had a lot of good things and a lot of things to be pleased with we did have a lot of mistakes and as i told the team football is still that way the team that doesnt beat themselves has the best chance to win we had some penalties weve got to get straightened around and some errors but a lot of good individual performances
946143 you know things were a lot smoother out there than i thought they were going to be you know going no huddle gives you a lot of time to kind of see what the defense is going to do and make some adjustments for the first time strapping up and going out there it felt pretty good
946144 i think people will be amazed when they get up close to these tigers and theres a white tiger and different kinds of bengal tigers in the show and i think they will be fascinated and kids will be awed by it
946145 we knew what the new players were about before they joined the club

946183 there is place for both open source and proprietary in any sme environment its really about the right tools for the job
946184 for example in a desktop environment in which users just need a simple web interface basic word processing and a spreadsheet an open source package such as ubuntu running openoffice would be perfect these users dont need the bells and whistles of a microsoft office

946186 sme versions of heavyweight proprietary solutions generally offer fewer features than their big brother counterparts which is why they are more affordable for the sme but what if the particular whistle that has been left out is one the sme needs and what if there are still features in the lite version that the sme can easily do without
946187 with an open source option smes can have a solution that not only fits their precise needs it will be easy to scale as the business grows

946468 the people of misamis oriental would not like disunity in the province we have yet to receive a resolution asking for a special election from any of the town councils in my own opinion its better to wait for 2010
946469 an elected congressman can get more projects for the district i have nothing to do with misamis oriental politics and i am not endorsing any candidate

946482 whether in my hotel room heading to an early morning workout or in the middle of a night match at the u s open wherever i am my racquet bag is usually with me so it has to be able to withstand what tennis players put it through but also look great on court i love the look and design of this bag line and am proud and excited to be one of the first to carry the black white version on tour

946485 our products have been used by tennis champions for over 135 years with this new line of nadal junior racquets we hope to inspire a whole new generation of players to discover and enjoy the game of tennis

946715 nuisance parking should be tackled and the original intention of the guidance was to give drivers half a chance from committing an offence
946716 now it seems now that councils want the powers to levy fines without any responsibility to deter unwelcome parking and worse they do not have to prove anything if it came to an appeal
946717 the current position has worked well as blatant obstruction was always simple to deal with
946718 if a car is causing a problem it is towed way its as simple as that
946719 these proposals introduce a massive grey area which will lead to countless disputes where motorists will say they were unaware they were doing anything wrong

946754 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
946755 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
946756 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
946757 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
946758 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
946759 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
946760 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances

946789 there is a deadly snake in these parts that can kill you with just one bite it has orange and black stripes and usually found with its tail sticking out of the bushes if you come across a snake just grab it by the tail pull it out quickly and give it a judo chop on the head

946793 i think i just bring an unchanging work ethic more than anything else
946794 and i have a good relation ship with this coaching staff and with linebacker coach joe vitt and im just always working to get better i know that at some point my days in this city are going to be numbered
946795 and i think its having kind of a former walk on mentality being a walk on in college is where i feel like any day could be my last day or any play could be my last play i just kind of approach everything that way im always trying to get better and i try not to take any thing for granted
946796 theres always kind of a concern with guys like me where they almost put too much pressure on themselves
946797 and thats important and thats a big part of success but i think being demanding of yourself and coming in i come in every year trying to be the most conditioned guy on the team and i think that helps me as well
946798 no question about it weve got better competition right now out there at every position
946799 so that competition is the impetus i think that will allow us to be a better football team because every body knows that no job is secure
946800 its just because i know in this league especially at the linebacker position theyre always looking for some younger faster prettier looking linebacker and theyre always searching at any point they can come in and try to replace me and i know that at some point thats probably going to happen until then im just going to come in and keep working away and do my best and try to be the best player i can for this team
946801 i think its a combination of all those things personally im not big on the whole accolades and all the pro bowl stuff and all that
946802 i wish i would have hurt my back the first day of training camp then i wouldnt have had to go through camp
946803 but truthfully it was a struggle it was a mental struggle more than anything else because it wasnt as bad as a torn acl
946804 absolutely i know where i make my money and its up on the line of scrimmage blocking thats not to say i cant make plays ive made plays throughout my career but the reason ive played 10 years is because i can block
946805 coming to camp one of the things i thought about occasionally was there was going to be the test when we put our pads on and continuously hit
946806 that would be the test for me to see how i felt i passed with flying colors and i dont even think about it any more
946807 obviously when he gets on the field were really going to appreciate him
946808 hes one of the best in the game so were excited
946809 we would be the ultimate tight end if they could be put our bodies together
946810 thats one of the things that will be a strength for us no question

946891 from my time in the white house and in the senate i have learned that you bring change by working in the system established in our constitution you cannot pretend that the system doesnt exist
946892 you need to know when to stick to principles and fight and know when to make principled compromises
946893 a s bad as george bush has been its going to take more than a change of parties in the white house to truly turn this country around george bush and dick cheney may have turned divisive special interest politics into an art form but they didnt invent it it was there before they got to washington and if you and i dont stand up and challenge it it will be there long after they leave
946894 the conventional washington thinking on foreign policy that led us to this tragic war in iraq

947047 i think the overriding unifying force for kentucky democrats across the state is a desire to replace mitch mcconnell with someone who can relate better to the majority of kentuckians
947048 i think that is the driving force but it opens a great opportunity for bruce lunsford
947049 there doesnt seem to be a lot of what i would call grass roots and local efforts it seems to be limited to a tv campaign at this point
947050 i would not describe the no 1 issue in the country as a diversion
947051 this is what the american people are thinking about and talking about and what they expect us to do something about
947052 i think there is a passion this time and its called anger theres a lot of anger in the country
947053 its a really important question to answer do you have enough resources to not only answer attacks but get your message out
947054 bruce lunsford is a candidate who has to continue to build his own identity with the voters
947055 anytime you get more visitors from the outside it gets more people to the restaurants hotels gas stations retail shops
947056 its something that you cant put your finger on but it has an impact when people see that
947057 i know there was a more organized effort downtown to really welcome them through the windows
947058 i wanted to live in a small town like this and maybe someday i will
947059 i think its still a competitive playing field and there are still two distinct choices for people to make on news
947060 but it clearly indicates that what were doing has both stability and now shows momentum also
947061 those are huge drops for a very stable industry and theres no explanation for them
947062 its not only prime time but late news early news early morning its all over the place to my mind it puts the entire book in question
947063 my first comment when i learned about the book was
947064 one of my primary goals is to make the station more competitive in the news programming in particular
947065 we never get too happy when we have a great book or too sad when we have a bad book because we understand the holes in the methodology
947066 this is the like the picture of a shadow of a statue of a man
947067 no open frames so far miss shirley youre doing good
947068 im gonna try to stay that way for a while
947069 mitzy was a smart woman when she decided to buy this for us
947070 i wondered about it because though its pretty simple to use you have to know how to use the remote
947071 but they all seemed to pick it up and i didnt realize they were going to be so competitive
947072 consolidated baptist church upper street lexington rev william humphrey howard
947073 otis hunn owner of hunns grocery store and hunns barbershop
947074 with the typical historical display people are presented with something behind glass and told
947075 what were doing is asking people to participate with us and try to understand what we have
947076 to me it makes history more of a living thing that we all can relate to
947077 i dont think its a prudent expenditure at this time in light of the current budget situation
947078 prioritizing spending would demand that fuel get put in troopers cars before tasers get put in holsters
947079 what good is it to have tasers if you dont have fuel in your cars
947080 i feel like i am selling a new product that people have never heard of
947081 formula is not the normal way to feed babies but really a very inferior way
947082 if theyre not breast feeding in the hospital its highly unlikely theyre going to go home and start breast feeding
947083 you have to help mom not to get frustrated with what is normal
947084 they think its just a fluff rather than an important part of a babys life and a moms life
947085 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes
947086 once their hands and feet are frozen they really are unable to move on their own power and it takes other people to carry them down
947087 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
947088 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over
947089 that does suggest those folks are important for the spending outlook and the overall economic outlook
947090 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
947091 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
947092 were down to a total of two crews for three airplanes
947093 we face a very different environment for luxury indulgence in 2008 as compared to 2007
947094 a very difficult marketplace for luxury goods over the next five years
947095 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet
947096 those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues
947097 the high end buyers out there are maybe more selective now but im willing to wait out the storm
947098 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
947099 if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies they would have been clear to bill medicare from the virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies
947100 will only be successful if those tasked with ensuring compliance exercise due diligence when conducting screenings and inspections
947101 the information age has been good to nerds no longer are they relegated to getting sand kicked in their faces by that other familiar archetype the jock weve gotten used to watching steve jobs grin awkwardly as he announces the latest hot techie toy and when it comes to pop culture nerds like superbad writer star seth rogen are increasingly in control of their own image
947102 billy dee williams born april 6 1937 is an african american actor and writer best known for his role as lando calrissian in the star wars film series
947103 harrison ford born july 13 1942 is an academy award and bafta nominated as well as golden globe winning american actor
947104 there are many arguments on either side of any issue and were not going to be able to resolve here which ones are better since we come to it with preconceptions and prejudices we cant get over easily
947105 the solution you have provided is all well and good and i mean neither to question your integrity nor your intelligence but given the fact that it is not maintainable and not scalable i fear that trying to implement it will push us beyond our deadline
947106 people are not always aware of this problem but a lack of transport investment and an unsustainable dependence on the motor car is something all cities in the uk have to address
947107 congestion charging is a controversial solution but where it pays for investment in public transport extensive research shows that there are substantial benefits for the local economy as well as both private individuals from every social class and companies businesses and large organisations
947108 this new piece of work reaffirms our stance that the tif proposals will benefit all sections of our society from the poorest people who dont have access to a car through ordinary every day drivers to the biggest haulage companies who will enjoy a clearer more efficient road network
947109 its fairly easy to hire academics these days to say whatever you want bribing electorates even with better trams is tougher should the decision go to a referendum congestion charging in manchester is unlikely to go ahead
947110 if dr jerrams claims that poor public transport investment is damaging society are true then this is all the more reason for the government to stop blackmailing manchester into introducing a deeply unpopular new congestion tax by withholding public transport investment
947111 manchester city councils own traffic survey unit reports that 14 fewer cars drive into manchester city centre during the morning peak period since 1999 the city does not need a congestion charge
947112 the relentless fury of the music combined with the sense of chaos in the crowd made for some tense moments concertgoers trying to go up a set of cement steps were pushed backwards or blocked from exiting as a bull rush of male fans barreled down the steps knocking people over like dominoes

947124 alexander solzhenitsyn 1918 2008 russian calls for the canonization of butcher josef stalin uncannily coincide with the death of a great russian alexander solzhenitsyn who won the nobel prize in 1970 was a man who knew suffering first hand in 1945 he was sentenced to 8 years internment in a soviet gulag for naming stalin a boss and the master in a letter to a friend to be followed by exile during his imprisonment he meticulously recorded the horrors and cruelties of the gulag in a 1500 page masterpiece three volume the gulag archipelago which exploded in the west a wakeup call to the west about the reality of what was going on behind the iron curtain bill muehlenberg unlike the conventional analyses of academic historians and political scientists solzhenitsyns understanding never treated the soviet union as merely one tyranny among others rather it was an ideological regime built upon the twin pillars of violence and lies it was thanks to ideology that the 20th century experienced evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions ideology allowed tyrants and intellectuals alike to justify the unjustifiable and to amplify violence to nearly unimaginable levels

947138 the culture wars so damaged literature as a source of cultural authority that literary intellectuals lost the public stage they were replaced by scientific popularizers such as steven jay gould richard dawkins and steven pinker cf literary agent
947139 my own dog in this fight is a general academic rehabilitation of normativity so called and not just in literature as well as a return to generalism by which i mean
947140 writing for stupid uneducated people who will never really understand the sophisticated stuff we do
947141 this would involved the renunciation of the positivist dream of grounding everything on science and truth

947150 given the companys significant exposure to construction loans and its concentration in california fitch anticipates that it is unlikely that credit quality will return to more normalized levels in the near term
947151 the data reminds us that the current housing crisis was overwhelmingly the result of the explosion of bad loan products in financially vulnerable communities
947152 it is not surprising that foreclosures have been concentrated among african americans and latinos because predatory and problematic loans are more prevalent in those communities
947153 enterprises goal for the fund is to create a new resource for green affordable housing and demonstrate how the carbon markets can and must deliver benefits to low income people
947154 we still firmly believe that splitting our businesses will unlock the unrealized value of the information solutions businesses and strengthen the competitive position of both companies
947155 however given the uncertainty in the real estate and mortgage credit markets we believe it is prudent to delay the split our primary focus at this time is expense management product development and maximizing profitability
947156 we are cautiously optimistic that stabilization in the decline rate is the first indicator that house price declines may not be getting any worse nationally

947165 our understanding with the us was good throughout and it never came to acrimony but they are the biggest subsidisers in the world in terms of what affects us so we will have to see them in court
947166 i dont have any problem if they want to offer a partial deal that puts a cap on their subsidies
947167 but countries want the power to say no to some things in order to get what they want i dont think partial deals work in a system like the wto
947168 this was in slow motion and now it will be accelerated
947169 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
947170 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
947171 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties

947220 i look forward to helping shape a memorable and purposeful blc event by integrating the conference components with sea otter classics activities and events
947221 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
947222 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
947223 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
947224 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

947230 it troubles me greatly to hear that people see me as an expert or an authority
947231 i suppose its also an issue of personal style to me writing without a strong voice writing filled with second guessing and disclaimers is tedious and difficult to slog through i go out of my way to write in a strong voice because its more effective but whenever i post in a strong voice it is also an implied invitation to a discussion a discussion where i often change my opinion and invariably learn a great deal about the topic at hand i believe in the principle of strong opinions weakly held

947233 private corporations similarly justify their activities by referring to their possession of similar resources of competence expertise becomes a commodity for which rival state agencies and rival private corporations compete civil servants and managers alike justify themselves and their claims to authority power and money by invoking their own competence as scientific managers of social change thus there emerges an ideology which finds its classical form of expression in a pre existing sociological theory webers theory of bureaucracy

947244 tomorrow tuesday afternoon i will be presented at real madrid this will be the start of a new chapter in my life i will do everything to help the team and the club to win trophies
947245 this is about as bold an anti enforcement measure as ive ever seen

947268 the high correlation of sterling with banking stocks implies that earnings results from hsbc barclays and rbs may have a decisive say over the next move in sterling provided that the boe does not spring a surprise on thursday
947269 it is not inconceivable that interest rates could be either raised or cut
947270 the general view seemed to be that the july mpc minutes were on the hawkish side and that if the bank of england does move interest rates in the near term it will be more likely to raise them rather than cut them

947273 but one of the nice things about writing for my own soul and my own prayer is that i kind of move along with the community of people who know his music and i can write things that are meaningful for those same people
947274 both of those approaches work for me its not that one is more common than the other

947276 we had a huge shift that came with the second vatican council and a call to adapt our liturgy to this modern world rather than living and worshiping in a way that was somewhat disconnected from our daily and weekly experience it was a shifting of the ground beneath many peoples feet
947277 a shift of the pendulum in the other way sort of a balancing were being reminded not to lose some of the pieces of music and rituals that have been part of our long roman catholic tradition

947281 i was supposed to letterman and conan in the next couple of weeks but im not sure whats going to happen with all of that because of the strike
947282 the strike did cut our episodes down to five instead of the eight that tbs ordered so we have been greatly affected
947283 the show is a sketch show based on my standup
947284 ill be setting up sketches with some background for the audience and sometimes making an observation about an actor and then showing how that observation can be applied in a situation for example al pacino always yells in movies so it would be great to see what he would do if he had to play a librarian
947285 fox has brought me to another level in the entertainment industry
947286 just being associated with guys like terry bradshaw howie long and jimmy johnson has made my name grow
947287 some of it is natural and theres a lot of practice that goes into it as well theres no set process for me its lots of observation and just reacting and mimicking when i look at someone its almost like im looking in a mirror and doing the same thing the other person is doing i hear things and see things that the average person might miss my brain just breaks people down
947288 the keys are the pitch of the voice cadence and the persons dialect if you get one of those people probably might start to recognize it if you get two lots of people will probably get it and if you hit all three thats when you have a dead on impression
947289 im a huge jim carrey fan but i loved robin williams and jonathan winters the most as a kid i love the tangents they went on that was my style of humor and i just used the impressions the same way they did kooky characters
947290 brett favre is the most fun to say i dont know what it is maybe its because he says it so much in real life but its just the perfect sounding name for madden to say
947291 i do bill walton marv albert charles barkley and jim rome sports has always been a big part of my life
947292 my dad was a minor league infielder with the white sox in the 1960s and i loved playing sports as a kid we won the aau national 14 and under baseball championships in 1988 i just never had the arm to go on to the next level i was going to play in college at the university of wisconsin milwaukee but decided that it would be better for me to study instead
947293 were on sunday mornings so we have to be careful we can make fun of the studio guys pretty much any way we want we just dont like to mess with their families other than terrys ex wives its silly humor not meant in a mean way at all
947294 but i dont do it to be negative i did barkley on the show and i did jb ex fox and current cbs nfl studio host james brown some people get mad but jb liked it and even gave me the permission to do it
947295 i think of people as being equal even though i understand theres history that limits what i would ever do
947296 people who know me know that i rarely talk about what i do
947297 i was raised that way my dad the late richard gumbel was a judge he was smarter that i am and a better person than i am im just a guy on tv i prefer to be a quiet person i have friends who enjoy the limelight id rather play golf everyday
947298 i have never enjoyed or been more proud of a show ever
947299 sports are games but they have a serious side says gumbel
947300 i laugh because for the reporters the most intense thing we do is the interview after the story
947301 there is a common thread in stories that interest me
947302 there is no massive principle but what it comes down to is whether that story makes someone say hmm i didnt know that television at its finest shows viewers something that they have not seen tells them something they did not know and takes them somewhere they have not been
947303 you have to think about how much the viewer can learn from a story does it have a good central character some stories are better in video than in print others are great stories but just not good for tv
947304 we have excellent production assistants on the show they scour the small type in various periodicals looking for stories there is also a great camaraderie among the correspondents and producers it is not uncommon for one of our producers to show a story to his or her peers to get feedback this is quite rare but a regular part of our program we want to look good in the eyes of our peers
947305 when a story comes up we see who is available maybe frank deford or bernie goldberg is around but maybe not it would be nice to have the luxury of tailoring a story to a correspondent but we dont have that
947306 count me among those who dont care about them and wont watch them so try not to laugh when someone says these are the worlds greatest athletes despite a paucity of blacks that makes the winter games look like a gop convention
947307 before he cleans out his office have paul tagliabue show you where he keeps gene upshaws leash by making the docile head of the players union his personal pet your predecessor has kept the peace without giving players the kind of guarantees other pros take for granted try to make sure no one competent ever replaces upshaw on your watch
947308 what gumbel said about gene upshaw and our owners is about as irresponsible as anything ive heard in a long time
947309 it was not a personal stab and i was not out to get him there was no sabotage here i just think he is a bad choice for the job he is doing
947310 he gets a pass but he is doing a bad job for his constituents i have no personal vendetta against gene you would have been shocked at the number of calls of support i got from players they thanked me the problems of the nfl players association were hidden now they are on the front burner i hope that one day the players association realizes that they can easily do better without gene upshaw
947311 i agonized over saying what i said about gene and whether i was saying more than i should i dont want to say something that can hurt someone personally that is not proper
947312 look we are all free to criticize the play of donovan mcnabb or how he deals with the media
947313 after mcnabbs comments people said that a guy like rex grossman has gotten more criticism mcnabb played the race card they said well there are many people who feel victimized by race a thousand times and say nothing it is silly to think that you are in a position to critique someones feelings it would be like me criticizing a woman who was raped do i in any way know what she felt
947314 people see a black athlete making a lot of money and say im making 25 00 an hour at the plant i dont want to hear you bitch the divide has grown
947315 many people are jealous and many rich athletes are completely out of touch i got a lot of flack for saying that i dont watch the winter olympics because there are few black athletes mcnabb addressed the controversy most people are afraid to say the word race
947316 we define people as good or bad based on how they treat us if an athlete is mean we assume he goes home and beats his wife unless we stay with these guys in a number of different environments we really dont know if an athlete is approachable hes great if an athlete does not speak to the media hes an a ole
947317 hes happy hes productive hes professional and despite reports of his premature burial hes suddenly seen as a good guy
947318 the randy turnaround says a lot about the man but the publics view of him says even more about the perspective of fans and media people alike in a world where every and anybody wants to have a say and pretend theyre an image maker its a reminder of a plain and simple football truth that applies to both players and coaches that if you lose fans and media types cant help you and if you win they cant hurt you
947319 we complain about guys giving cookie cutter answers to questions and then there is outrage when someone speaks his mind vijay singh took a lot of heat when in 2003 he said that annika sorenstam should have to qualify to play in mens competitions a guy like derek jeter says nothing so well never know how he feels
947320 i do find it sad that in an era where athletes are our most recognizable and admired role models we come upon a presidential election and we have no idea whom they support
947321 kurt warner spoke publicly about a religious issue stem cell research in missouri i may not agree with him but at least he is involved its hard to find a single athlete wholl say one word about who should be president i admire people who show that they are part of the world in which they live as opposed to those who dont realize and dont care about the influence they wield
947322 i compare spygate to watergate with watergate a lot of people said oh well every president probably did it nixon was the one who got caught belichick got caught and this will stay with him forever
947323 belichick is not friendly to the media if he were more approachable he might be given a pass im surprised that roger goodell stopped investigating it is not consistent with what he has been doing with other rules violations as for running up the score i am not sure if there is any truth to that or if it even matters i do have concern that in retaliation someone might beat the crap out of tom brady on the field
947324 i think people are now piling on michael vick he lost millions of dollars his reputation and his livelihood he has to piss in a cup with regularity and was in home confinement he is paying the price for what he did no one loves dogs more than i do my dogs archie and cujo hate michael vick and would like to see him punished but there is a limit
947325 people who say stupid things on the air and then wonder why they catch flack for it
947326 did you see gilbert arenass blog after the opening game of the season he said it was as incredible a building as he has ever been in and that he was not ready for that type of atmosphere
947327 they have picked up the ball from the pats and sox and they are running with it they are capitalizing on the success of those two teams and the organization is very conscious of that
947328 this is as good an ownership as ive been around they have shown a willingness to spend money and when danny ainge has come to them saying he needed something they have never said no they also never gave any indication that dannys or docs rivers job was in jeopardy
947329 the ownership has given danny a chance to do his thing
947330 he told me three or four years ago that he was going to collect some chips either those young players would develop or he would trade them for established talent
947331 if they had gotten the first or second draft pick i think they would have taken kevin durant or greg oden and blended them in with al jefferson and the other young players when that did not happen danny did a good job of putting another plan into effect he had players that were desirable to other teams he was never backed into a corner danny would have preferred to get oden or durant but this option turned out even better
947332 after getting ray allen on draft night danny went back to garnett and asked how do we look now
947333 garnett is an old soul i didnt know what to expect personality wise a lot of people have said that it would have been better to get garnett when he was younger i think we got him at the perfect time he is motivated to win a title and danny knew that
947334 i was fascinated talking to garnett he is inclusive it is we not i he is extremely sensitive as well he told me that in his entire career he has never felt so appreciated he wants to give back
947335 these guys are into the process of getting to where they want to be there are in no hurry to get to may and june they want to enjoy every practice and game this is probably the best team that ray allen garnett and paul pierce have been on and they are going to make the garden a tough place to play again
947336 the goal of really good players is to make the other guys around them better with kg and ray guys like brian scalabrine and kendrick perkins can focus on their strengths
947337 this team is so much better defensively assistant coach tom thibodeau has a reputation for coaching defense i asked tommy heinsohn about the defense and he said that it is so much easier when the best player garnett buys in
947338 the top 8 players on this team can all play defense and they have all bought into this i spoke to weei midday host dale arnold and he said lets see how things are 30 games into the season i told him that he has not been around kevin garnett too much
947339 sometimes you love your job but there is one part of it that you dont like
947340 thats how i see pierce with garnett paul does not have to do that anymore paul tried to be the vocal leader but it is not in his nature to stand up and speak in the locker room ray allen is a great leader but he is not very demonstrative garnett would give me a glare if he heard me say this but ultimately he will be the defining guy on this team
947341 doc welcomes the expectations its great to develop players but you look up and youre 100 games under 500 doc would rather hear people say that the celtics should reach the conference finals as opposed to saying they might be an 8th seed and get knocked out in the first round
947342 if this team loses a few games they are not going to question themselves and turn it into a long losing streak thats what happened with the young players last year people have asked how many games i think this team will win this season i tell them that the number for me is 72 if garnett pierce ray allen and rondo can play 72 games they will be great
947343 doc wants to play 8 guys 9 at the most in key games one of the big 3 pierce allen garnett will always be on the floor maybe even two of them rondo can tape his fingers together and the team will be fine
947344 i try be non intrusive hopefully adding to the viewing experience without interrupting it
947345 a little humor every now and then helps and knowing when to be quiet is all important play by play announcers who think they are the show are all too common these days
947346 there are too many guys who are just trying to get on
947347 i got to spend a month in barcelona with my wife teri and our daughter kristen age 7 at the time that was the year of the original basketball dream team with whom we spent a lot of time as a family we still retell stories and adventures we had that month
947348 i was spoiled to walk right in with the 1980s celtics those teams were very rare and now to have it happen again i am ecstatic people say that allen and garnett are old but come on we are not talking about roger clemens here these guys have all come together at the perfect time
947349 after close call vs eagles patriots are imperfect 11 0
947350 we got a good break with the two teams being undefeated going in and i cant remember anyone at cbs sports being more pumped up for a regular season football game
947351 history has showed us that the patriots and colts are both willing to do something different so i cant wait to find out and cant wait to watch on sunday
947352 i think these two teams are a little bit different from the standpoint of how the teams were built indianapolis built their team through the draft and new england a lot of their skill positions were filled through free agency
947353 dungy and manning have the mental edge theyve been the underdog to these guys last three times they played them and they beat them i dont care if they have their whole contingent or not i really believe somewhere along the way it is going to come down to good versus evil
947354 it is hard to believe that the colts have an advantage when they walk in as almost a touchdown underdog in their own building but i think that might be the edge they are used to being in this position when they play this football team a lot of talk about respect and admiration if the patriots could beat you 60 0 today that would happen
947355 i dont care if you run the ball or pass the ball if you dont have an offensive line you cant do either
947356 the patriots look forward to the battle and theyre willing to battle from start to finish youve got to prove as the opposition that you are willing to fight that long all of this really feeds into what they love they like the turmoil they like the action
947357 all of us in the media took that opportunity to attach what happened in the
947358 because you have two of the most potent offenses in the national football league their defenses are going to have to match that and slow each teams offense down to some extent
947359 peyton manning is going to have to play keep away from tom brady usually teams play keep away from peyton manning but theyre going to have to run the football be good on third downs and keep that offense off the field
947360 they new england are unstoppable this is the best offense the nfl has ever seen
947361 when they get the running game going with laurence maroney they are going to be impossible to beat
947362 moss is one of the best receivers in traffic because he focuses on the football
947363 i think the only person that can stop new englands offense is the guy whose game plan stopped the greatest show on turf in super bowl xxxvi and also the guy whose game plan sits in canton ohio for stopping the buffalo bills in super bowl xxv
947364 that would be bill belichick if this team goes on and wins another championship i think you have to mention belichick and tom brady in the conversation for best ever at what they do
947365 the reason they are the best is because bill belichick is an outstanding coach he coaches new players young players rookies free agents and then on top of that he coaches his coaches he lost charlie weis he lost romeo crennel eric mangini what does he do he grooms young coaches to take their place
947366 theyve won with one star on the offense who was not as good as he is now in tom brady add randy moss to a team that has had one of the top three defenses as far as points allowed in football the sky is the limit for this team this is a team that i can sit here and say this is a team that can go undefeated

947368 what we have today could in no way be described as democracy
947369 today we have an oligarchy power limited to a closed circle
947370 mr owens letter states that as the current shareholder issues remain unresolved he feels it is difficult for him to continue working independently as his role demands
947371 they have only agreed a list of questions to be discussed in order for a cease fire to be agreed
947372 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
947373 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
947374 although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back
947375 we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
947376 im excited its good to have him back in the house
947377 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
947378 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
947379 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
947380 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
947381 but like i said its not the first time and it wont be the last time
947382 if we played a game tomorrow aaron rodgers would be the starting quarterback
947383 im not going to change any direction that weve gone with this football team based on the information i have here today thats part of our conversation tomorrow and we have all the confidence in the world in aaron
947384 development and test teams are on the leading edge of exploiting cloud based virtual infrastructure to deliver tangible results to the business in terms of a more agile delivery platform and reduced costs

947386 both cohesive ft and skytap share the vision of how cloud computing services will accelerate the adoption of virtualization by companies looking to streamline their it infrastructure
947387 our partnership with skytap will deliver a new class of solution where the ability to dynamically assemble and provision virtual machines is possible over the web
947388 colorado was so on fire and their offense was so tough to deal with
947389 game 1 was the key philly was so fired up having beaten the mets for the division title then they lost the first two at home phillys pitching and some managerial moves by charlie manuel were very suspect
947390 it all came together when they approached me in august
947391 at first i thought id be doing an american league series most likely anaheim vs cleveland at that time it looked like the yankees would not make the playoffs but things shifted
947392 tbs didnt want a red sox announcer doing a yankees series they thought yankee fans would not like that it was the same with cleveland or anaheim fans at the national level they fear any perception of possible bias
947393 tbs has an 8 year deal i dont know if ill be doing any games beyond this season but i hope to talk to them later this year
947394 i knew nothing about them when they came to boston for interleague play this year but they beat curt schilling and josh beckett and took two out of three games
947395 i dont put a lot of stock in what they did in june theyre like the twins stockpiling young talent that has come through as late as september 15 they were 6 5 games out with three teams ahead of them
947396 the only thing i can compare it to is morgan magic when joe morgan took over the red sox in 1988 and the team went on that great streak 12 straight wins and 19 out of 20
947397 their pitching staff has some young talent like franklin morales and ubaldo jimenez josh fogg and jeff francis are solid todd helton is a leader and troy tulowitzki is playing beyond his years but i really think the layoff will hurt them
947398 it was similar to the tigers last year colorado has won 21 of 22 when you are on a streak like that you want to play the next day
947399 the air is ridiculously thin there it was so tough for them to sign free agents especially pitchers the baseball becomes harder at that altitude
947400 they started putting the baseballs in a humidor and it has totally offset the thin air that is as loud a crowd as i have ever heard especially for that one game playoff against san diego
947401 with garrett atkins todd helton matt holliday brad hawpe and others they can put up big run totals this year they broke the red sox 2006 record for fewest errors in a season
947402 clint hurdle is an interesting manager and person i met him when i was calling games for aa binghamton and he was managing the norfolk tides in the mets system he has a saying go eat he tells his pitchers not to nibble just go out there and eat
947403 i know that during the last two weeks of the season the team sent guys to scout prospective postseason opponents they have extensive information on colorado there will be no surprises
947404 tim wakefield was talking to me about this the other night if you looked into the eyes of guys like grady sizemore during that game 7 vs cleveland their reaction to the pressure was different clevelands youth caught up to them
947405 eric wedge is a friend and he told me that the youth of his team would be a factor as it was in 2004 the red sox pitching will be the key colorados pitching simply does not match up with bostons i like the red sox in six games
947406 i think randy moss is more reliable than terrell owens randy doesnt drop the ball
947407 the two best pair of hands i ever saw were deion sanders and randy moss comparing randy and t o is like comparing night and day
947408 he is a jerk he doesnt go over the middle he is not physical and he wont block joe gibbs said that to play this game you need character intelligence and ability randy moss only has the third
947409 i could sit for hours and listen to men like bill belichick
947410 owens loves the attention hes starving for the attention everything is about him ive never once seen randy moss say oh its about me i want to go to the pro bowl i want to do this here hes moss talking about winning championships
947411 he went to the new england patriots to try to win a championship terrell didnt go to the dallas cowboys to win a championship he went there to get money it is all about him you cannot do that
947412 in all of terrell owens career ive seen him make one big catch against the green bay packers at the end of the game
947413 im a true believer in that a team needs great character in addition to great talent in order to achieve success when you look at the giants and see all of the talent theyve had over the last several years you almost have to say why hasnt this team been able to accomplish more
947414 then you look at some of the public comments made recently by barber about eli manning
947415 if it hadnt been for tom coughlin tiki barber might not have even been playing these last couple of years
947416 tiki dropped the ball so many times that theres a good chance hed be over on the sidelines but i guess now that hes in the broadcast business he has gotten a lot smarter and forgot about all those fumbles
947417 you should keep your mouth shut go sit on the bench show some class and be thankful youve been given another chance thats what wins people back to your side and thats what shuts your detractors up
947418 just how thin is the national football league as far as quality quarterbacks are concerned that we have to go and get a guy out of a wheelchair put him on a team and he stands a chance to start today
947419 new england will be even more determined more focused and more ready for this game because they know the environment they know the team they are going to play is a well rounded team and they know it will take their best to win all that is right up new englands alley
947420 new england is a team where winning is important to them but they also love to battle i have always said that in athletics always be afraid of the person who loves to battle they have proven ever since bill belichick has been there that they can fight for a long time
947421 a lot of teams have wanted a piece of new england over the years and they enjoy that fight but somewhere in the second half they end up asking is this fight ever going to end
947422 mike lowell has the all time record defensively at third base
947423 i have vivid childhood memories of being at spring training in winter haven sitting in the booth watching legendary red sox announcers ned martin and ken coleman call the games
947424 al walker the broadcast engineer would make sure i had plenty of popcorn and hot dogs
947425 i was only 25 years old when i got the red sox play by play job with nesn in 1988
947426 my dad told me not to worry if i didnt get it because i was so young i looked at ken coleman and ned martin who had been doing it for thirty years and realized that jobs like this dont open up too often
947427 they never had a conversation with me about why i was fired i got the call in december of 2004 i had an option year left on my contract and figured id be back i heard it was because i was making more money than don orsillo but they never came to me and negotiated
947428 thats the only thing that angered me if nesn thought i was making too much money but there should have been some back and forth some negotiation
947429 i had no idea that joe carter was going to hit a home run in game 6 to win the world series in 1993
947430 theres no advance notice those calls tend to be the best you just do it i also called game 7 of the 1992 nlcs when francisco cabrera won the game for atlanta as sid bream slid into home my voice fell apart and i thought i botched the call the next day cbs sent me a bunch of great reviews you have to go with the moment
947431 i talked to the arizona diamondbacks last winter about doing some games for them but i would have had to move to do it
947432 thats curt hes going to say whatever he feels like saying because he thinks hes always right he doesnt care what anyone else thinks
947433 the thing here is that curt is not right piniella has never left the game how can he be out of touch curt needs to stop talking so much and concentrate on what he needs to do to come back and pitch
947434 i played with guys in philly who liked to fight but we never looked for a fight curt is just adding fuel to the fire i dont know why he would want to continue this i mean it seems like curt has ample opportunities to hear himself on radio tv and in the newspaper
947435 i know boston has jason varitek but we had catcher darren daulton the best leader i ever saw when curt would talk too much darren would take him aside and tell him that we were not about that when youre young you listen
947436 im not around the red sox but ive talked to people who played with curt and they do resent that he talks so much curt says a lot of things he shouldnt say in fact a former phillies teammate still wants a piece of him
947437 of all the pitchers of the last 10 or 15 years curt would be the guy id want to pitch a big game
947438 psychologically speaking it seems to me that donovan is one of those kids thats reaching out for some love
947439 mcnabb gets hurt with a groin injury goes on the bench then he gets hurt with a knee injury and jeff garcia plays so well
947440 i thought that we were long past this but i look at it this way i played a black quarterback in 1972 before donovan was ever born
947441 he thinks that maybe hes being criticized with what hes going through today it didnt compare to what my guys had to go through
947442 tv is scared to death of the internet they dont know how to use it and they dont know how to make money on it
947443 most television station or network websites just push people to watch their shows the internet is becoming the new broadcast hub in truth the internet is another tv and radio channel
947444 how do i get all this information in one spot we wont have highlights because you can get that anywhere look at any station in boston they all run the same highlights especially with the nfls ban on sideline cameramen we want to show targeted regional information in a national and international forum
947445 sports fans want things that start an argument the idea is to get differing regional perspectives in one place a cowboys fan in boston can log on and hear or see a reporter from dallas talking about the cowboys it is a platform
947446 reporters who come on as contributors will be pushing viewers back to their sites or stations i am in talks with 15 20 websites to provide video and audio exclusively to us it will be a constant promotional site between speeding bullet and our contributors its all about creating traffic
947447 i am actively talking about including an instructional piece to the puzzle where lessons in golf hockey and other sports will be available on our site
947448 we are expecting nascar to do some things next year ive also spoken to a couple of ex nfl players about creating content that prepares high school athletes for college and college athletes for the nfl draft its all about seeing it and hearing it not just reading it
947449 these days you have to hijack a station to get new ideas considered if you can create content and edit it to five minutes well run it
947450 fans can send us one minute of video or audio and well post it they can rant rave scream holler and opine there is no centralized place where sports fans can go right now our site will allow red sox and yankee fans to go at it online
947451 a web site run by media professionals for media professionals a content service that reporters and commentators can use 24 7 via voice or video
947452 this is my baby and it has taken a lot longer than i thought to get to this point more than two years safety netaccess and its owner sean gorman have been instrumental in the fabulous design and look of the website they do amazing work
947453 ive had so many outlets say that they love the idea but we need to grow and show them what we can do well hit bumps and make mistakes but the internet is constantly a work in progress i dont expect to get much sleep for the next six months
947454 in the next 5 years sports fans viewing habits are going to change drastically
947455 tv is losing numbers in droves and people are not buying newspapers
947456 compared to the internet a network like cn8 reaches two people
947457 i am happy to say that many of my former cn8 guests are going to be working on speeding bullet network
947458 tom brady randy moss carson palmer chad johnson i hope we get a shootout this game is an easy sell the personalities make people watch
947459 basically jamie foxx breaks into a vault and finds photos of some players in this game when the spying stuff went down with the pats i seriously looked at this again and thought about not running it the herald piece was way off and they ran a correction it has nothing to do with the patriots spying issue
947460 current players dont differentiate between broadcast and cable espn is older than most of the players in the nfl the combination of espn and mnf resonates with them it is a bigger deal to be on monday night than any other night
947461 38 of people who watch espn are hardcore sports fans 62 of espns viewers are casual sports fans however with espns nfl coverage it is 50 hardcore and 50 casual fans
947462 nbc sunday night announcers al michaels and john madden may appeal to the hardcore fan more than our show but we also have to play a bit to those casual fans we do this through news analysis fun features and having celebrities visit the booth the way i see it we do a super bowl every monday night
947463 its impossible to switch a game to monday night with hotels tickets and all that it would be problematic from a logistical standpoint in that way not getting flex scheduling was a non issue
947464 they are the eyes and ears of the game they can smell it and hear it if an injury happens on one side of the field we dont have to lose time running a reporter over there michele and suzy work very hard before and during the game
947465 they are most compelling when they react to a moment they create a sense of immediacy and urgency look at cbs they touted last year that they were going without any sideline reporters yet in the super bowl they had one on each sideline
947466 they constantly feed info to the booth last week during a break michele told us that due to the noise in the superdome they had to turn the volume up in vince youngs helmet michele was not on air with this but she provided the information to us
947467 i was at abc for dennis millers second season on
947468 it is a disservice and a cheap shot to tony to compare him to dennis miller saying that dennis added more value is garbage the people doing the game couldnt understand dennis tony is extremely articulate and experienced as a reporter
947469 we were the only nfl television group to be nominated for an emmy and our emmy reel was dominated by tony he has a great way of elevating a big moment in the game
947470 there are some fixable mechanics issues such as when to elaborate on a moment in the game or when to let jaws run with the xs and os analysis
947471 he is a great team player and breaks the game down like no one else he called me the other day to tell me that he had just charted every brady pass and every moss catch jaws can laugh at himself and he fires up everyone around him the respect he has around the league is incredible
947472 new england can run the football inside the offensive line has the athletic ability to run the football outside and clear the way for the running backs the patriots have they have also been protecting tom brady very well thats why brady is off to such a fantastic start
947473 i love those guys and id do anything for them but anyone who understands the business knows that change can be good sometimes it is personally tough but i had to move on they handed me a new playbook and i have to run with it
947474 covering a football game is easy the challenge for us is to find a balance in playing to that total audience casual and hardcore weve won our nights ratings outright two times in three weeks
947475 at the end of the day i want a rich balanced telecast with all the bells and whistles
947476 defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak
947477 badgers at the back of the bus hacking off pieces and eating it
947478 were all aware of the slow downs in the u s economy and a lot of it is tied to the high cost of fuel and that is definitely impacting the airline business
947479 we want to move on this as soon as possible
947480 los ltimos meses fueron una pesadilla ahora estoy feliz y fuerte
947481 todas las personas tienen dos caras la sonriente cuando todo va bien y la triste cuande se vuelve las cosas van mal yo prefiero el lado bueno
947482 muchas veces estoy mosqueado pero me suelo guardar para mi el estado de nimo porque prefiero sonre r cuando estoy con otras personas no quiere decir que sea falso pero no me gusta cargar a los dem s con mis problemas
947483 una experiencia horrible para mi y el equipo antes del mundial me consideraban como pel tras la eliminaci n s lo escuch cr ticas que no ten a ganas de jugar que me fui a una fiesta tras el partido nadie me pregunt c mo estaba habr a respondido que estaba triste que me disgustaba no haber dado a mi pa s lo que me habr a gustado darle

947501 its a deliciously entertaining document that should be read by every political science student in america
947502 absolutely a pennsylvania statute provides for it its in their right to pay the legal bills for people who are being sued because of activities in connection to the charities
947503 to me theres a difference between paying for some suit thats in ones service to the organization that has been approved by the board and another in paying legal bills due to the unilateral taking of the assets
947504 the board had an independent attorney validate the hiring of our firm in the matter
947505 it wouldnt be appropriate to say anything about a case thats going to trial in five weeks

947513 dont bet on it or on oil prices heading higher as a result of hostilities
947514 recall that when israel took out iraqs osirak reactor back in 1981 it was successful precisely because it gave no hint at all of an impending attack
947515 this is what could drive crude oil prices to more than 300 a barrel which even over a short period would be cataclysmic to the global economy and stock markets
947516 in which iraq will emerge as a buffer state protected by a residual force of 30 000 to 40 000 u s troops they will be deployed in the desert away from the iranian border and iraqi cities serving in a non combat training role as a result iran will have little reason to fear more aggression from iraq
947517 iran has refused to halt its nuclear program despite the threat from major powers of increased u n sanctions
947518 the united states said on sunday that tehran had left the u n security council no choice but to increase sanctions after iran ignored an informal deadline to respond to an offer for talks on its nuclear program
947519 the west accuses iran of seeking to build atomic weapons a charge tehran denies
947520 we are just working out details of who is going to be called which is likely to include the financial secretary and the chief officers of the various ministries and the various cfos involved
947521 we are looking at possible dates in early september its going to be quite a number of people we are trying to manage that though trying to narrow it down a little
947522 i believe the legislative assembly has not been provided the tools necessary to achieve its vital function of financial oversight because of this i believe that the legislative assembly has lost effective control of the public purse
947523 i find the current situation deplorable it needs to be rectified immediately
947524 with the hope of being able to report substantial progress in the coming years
947525 t he reality of the situation is that government financial reporting has fallen years behind the required deadlines l egislators are being constantly asked to provide new funding without any significant accountability reports as to what government entities did with previous funds allocated to them in previous years
947526 without accountability the entire budgeting process is rendered almost meaningless
947527 no serious scrutiny of recent governmental expenditure since july 2004
947528 wishes to make clear that contrary to a media report the cayman islands government does not have 1 5 billion in outstanding accounts
947529 not one is in total compliance with the requirements for delivery of an annual report to the legislative assembly
947530 some of the largest and most important agencies to the people of the cayman islands
947531 from 2004 we have submitted our statements on time every year his claim that he has no audited financial statements makes him look worse in fact it means that we have had our stuff in on time and he hasnt gotten around to it yet our originals were all on time
947532 i think his report must be a little bit out of date
947533 prior to 2005 we had gone from being a government department to a statutory authority without a lot of planning and without having the time to put in place the systems and processes we needed
947534 we are trying to make sense of them we have to go in and make certain assumptions
947535 but were trying to get everything up to date with the end of the current financial year
947536 it is incorrect to say that government is yet to account for 1 5 billion in budgetary expenditure since the 2004 05 year
947537 today in the cayman islands there is at least 1 5 billion of operating expenditures that should have been accounted for that has not yet been reported to the legislative assembly to date there has been virtually no accounting to the legislative assembly for these funds even though there is a legislative requirement to do so
947538 i believe the legislative assembly has lost control of the public purse
947539 the reporting system as designed is a good one if it were working as contemplated in the law the cayman islands would be at the very forefront of financial accountability reporting among governments of the world
947540 i regret to report that not one ministry or portfolio met this deadline for the original set of financial statements and statements of outputs
947541 the situation is no better in the statutory authorities and government companies of the 25 entities not one is in total compliance with the requirements of the pmfl
947542 is easily lost because the pre mature release of details in the auditor generals report has resulted in an unbalanced article of unwarranted gloom and doom
947543 do very little to help people invest for their future and usually deter individuals from evaluating sensible financial plans
947544 it was a bit rough when we first started but things are starting to pick up now
947545 i flew to colorado and spent a week there being trained on how to drive and maintain the pedicabs
947546 i learned everything from how to maintain the shocks the brakes the wiring to how to change the tyres
947547 our customers really dont see us as just another form of transport like a taxi or a bus theyre all on vacation and want to have fun and this is a fun way to get around town or to get up to the beach its just a fun experience in the sun and it produces no air pollution
947548 the cost for a whole year is only 6 000 and thats a good deal because our cabs are seen by everybody both locals and tourists and we can go lots of places where no taxi or bus can go
947549 also people are always taking pictures of our cabs so its good exposure some publications charge clients 6 000 for just one month
947550 i have seen these youngsters develop as a unit for the past three years i have all reason to believe that they will do well cifa has done its part it is now their turn to go to trinidad and tobago and be good ambassadors bringing us victory
947551 coach mclean is an outstanding youth coach who has been very successful taking three youth titles this season namely the cifa under 18 fa cup and the under 16 and under 18 league titles they were also runners up in the under 14 competition as well
947552 this team is a reflection of the entire squad from last years tournament i wish them the best of luck throughout this competition
947553 i am fully comfortable with the squad at this time they have been training together since august last year they have gelled and are ready for the games
947554 the team spirit is favourable they are physically fit and mentally and technically prepared i expect nothing else but success from them
947555 i will do my hair for christmas and valentines day easter mothers day and fathers day
947556 we hope this experience exposes them to the olympic movement and lights a fire inside them
947557 we know that courtney and joseph will seize this opportunity to promote the cayman islands to the world
947558 i am excited to see different cultures and people from all over the world
947559 hopefully i will also get to return to the olympics to compete in horseback riding i also want to thank mary mctaggart for recommending me for the youth camp
947560 this is a dream that has finally come true for me
947561 besides the olympic pins to give away we are bringing rum cakes and cayman souvenirs to give to special friends we will make
947562 courtney has a great head on her shoulders and i know that she will use this experience to find out more about other people and cultures
947563 i think it will be an eye opener for him as china is a big country in the world so it should be a phenomenal experience and who knows where that will take him
947564 courtney and joseph are great role models for the young people from our islands they will have a tremendous time learning about people from so many countries and in turn teaching people about our culture it is an experience that will last a life time for them
947565 while the stimulus is making our economy stronger than it would have been otherwise the housing correction credit market turmoil and high energy prices remain a considerable drag on the economy and the effects of this drag can be seen in the soft job market
947566 we are making progress although not in a straight line housing continues to be at the heart of our economic challenges and remains our most significant downside risk
947567 we must work though the necessary adjustments in housing and credit markets to return to growth next year and beyond
947568 the key question is when will the correction be largely behind us while home price adjustments will continue for some time and certainly well beyond the end of the year i believe we can move through the bulk of the correction in months rather than years
947569 all parties must get to work immediately to address the systemic risk issues posed by the gses
947570 one of the reasons i decided to choose the cayman islands cancer society as my platform is because of my background as an aesthetician
947571 i feel i have a responsibility to educate caymanians about the dangers of sun exposure the risks posed and the damage it causes
947572 the cancer society is the perfect avenue to further reach out into the community to pass on my knowledge and increase public awareness im 24 years of age im passionate about skin and i have ambitions to return to university to pursue a medical degree in dermatology
947573 we all know somebody who has suffered skin problems as a result of sun exposure and sometimes the consequences can be severe even deadly often the damage that occurs to the skin as a result of a childhood sunburn is what leads to a diagnosis in adulthood
947574 its difficult to say when construction might start or finish
947575 and it may take four months or five months to start construction but it will also depend on how we decide to redevelop the port whether we build the cargo first and then the cruise berths or if we do it in phases until the negotiations we really dont know
947576 with one cruise pier first then build two cargo piers simultaneously
947577 as far as im concerned i know nothing i have only heard rumours nobody has said anything
947578 my friends have told me to hold out not to sell
947579 this is my familys business how can i sell it
947580 dms has always been a strong advocate for educating the public about the financial industry and this programme is a great way we can contribute to society by helping to inform them of the opportunities available

947584 we are pleased to partner with the ciga to host the hsbc 52nd caribbean amateur golf championships
947585 this event reflects the growing popularity quality and development of golf in the caribbean region and this sponsorship is also in line with hsbcs role as a key sponsor of golf events around the world we are expecting a very successful well contested event and we wish the cayman team much luck on the green
947586 sun business is excited to have rodney as an official member of our team
947587 we have had the pleasure of working with rodney on several projects he has very strong knowledge of business management and it software its a natural fit and we are very pleased to have him as the managing partner in nassau
947588 i understand business needs from our clients perspective coupled with my extensive knowledge of sage software i am able to help our clients get exactly what they need from their systems to generate meaningful information and reports
947589 by joining forces with sun business we can provide our combined client base an even broader level of service

947594 the caribbean sun is strong all year round and especially in the summer a car will act as a greenhouse heating up in minutes causing dogs to collapse from heat exhaustion which can ultimately lead to death
947595 it has happened in the past that pets have died from being left in cars here
947596 dogs particularly find it hard to cool themselves they can only sweat through their paws in addition to panting
947597 even in the shade with the windows down a parked car can soon become a deadly chamber for animals left inside
947598 a dog can die within minutes of being left in a hot car all types of dogs are susceptible to heat stroke if they are left in areas that are just too hot for them to manage and sadly some of them die

947600 leaving your dog outside while the temperatures are soaring could also do major damage

947660 handmade violins to the untrained eye they look all the same
947661 but every violin has its own personality and theyre all very very different

947689 ifc is delighted to work with rockland hospital the project will increase access to high quality health care especially for the growing population in manesar which has no sizable hospital at this time
947690 i am tired of hearing about bickering among the capitals chefs in order to raise their profile and celebrity status
947691 a number of high profile chefs are behaving like spoilt divas who have lost sight of why they began to cook in the first place their behaviour detracts terribly from what they should be doing concentrating on giving value for money to their customers preparing the best food and training and looking after the young chefs
947692 petulant children do not ordinarily make the best chefs we need positive role models not attention seekers who manipulate the publics outlook
947693 lets return some dignity to what is for some of us at least a civilised profession
947694 we hear nightmare stories of terrible work conditions it is even shown on tv and it is to my mind sadly glorified the worse they treat their staff the wider their smiles
947695 this is counter productive behaviour and can only damage the chances of us finding the talent of the future which the industry so badly needs
947696 playing is an essential part of growing up and adventurous play that both challenges and excites children helps instill critical life skills
947697 constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life
947698 children are not being allowed many of the freedoms that were taken for granted when we were children they are not enjoying the opportunities to play outside that most people would have thought of as normal when they were growing up
947699 that is very difficult for parents to manage because of the time pressures on normal family life if you dont want your children to play out alone and you have not got the time to take them out then they will spend more time on the computer
947700 in this exhibition i came to know that though snakes dont have ears but they do have internal ears therefore neither we should not scare them nor we should harm them
947701 we have organised this exhibition to spread awareness of snakes we even taught the children that snakes were not harmful at all and thus they should be treated with care with the motive to remove the myths about snakes amidst the people we have organised this one day exhibition
947702 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
947703 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
947704 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
947705 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia
947706 were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep

947708 punjabi diet is very rich compared to the diet the population living in southern part of the country it is for this reason that we are witnessing people at young age getting heart attacks
947709 we have seen people from punjab who had migrated to the west had higher prevalence of heart diseases 10 15 years back now that same culture has come to our country and today we find the prevalence of this disease has increased manifolds in our country
947710 the nuclear medicine is a new form of medicine with this particular investigation we will be able to diagnose patients non invasively without giving them any pricks
947711 earlier the heart related illness were noticed less among rural population but as urbanization of rural areas is taking place the urban rural difference is decreasing and more and more rural people are getting this disease
947712 one can do three things for preventing heart diseases eat less fried food less butter and ghee second exercise daily for around 45 minutes and third reduce stress in life because of the nature of the work we have become over stressed so things like yoga meditation and entertainment help a person to relax

947715 global warming is a reality but our data show climate science is complex it is wrong to take particular events and link them to carbon dioxide emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening

947718 we have never experienced such a demand before and we are delighted to assist so many couples registry spokesman greg curry said in a statement
947719 getting married on significant or lucky days is popular here at the registry many couples feel that getting married on the eighth day of the eighth month of 2008 will add something special
947720 this special calendar event has caused a sensation here mr curry said
947721 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it mr robertson said
947722 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision mr robertson said
947723 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
947724 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk mr langbroek said in a statement
947725 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era

947759 the commission found that comcast monitors its customers connections using deep packet inspection and then determines how it will route some connections based not on their destinations but on their contents
947760 in essence comcast opens its customers mail because it wants to deliver mail not based on the address on the envelope but on the type of letter contained therein the commission also found that comcasts conduct affected internet users on a widespread basis indeed comcast may have interfered with up to three quarters of all peer to peer connections in certain communities
947761 provide internet users with the opportunity to view high quality video that they might otherwise watch and pay for on cable television such video distribution poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand vod service
947762 we set a precedent on what isps can expect moving forward and we would consider fines in the future where we find violations but because this is the first action we took we are giving comcast an opportunity to say how and when they will stop these practices
947763 the company initially claimed that it did so interfered with attempts by customers to share files online using peer to peer applications only during periods of peak network congestion and of heavy network traffic
947764 later confronted with yet more evidence suggesting that interference was not limited in this manner comcast recast its position yet again and admitted that it interferes with peer to peer traffic regardless of the level of overall network congestion at the time and regardless of the time of day
947765 we are disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices and that we did not block access to web sites or online applications including peer to peer services
947766 we also believe that the commissions order raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays

947802 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
947803 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
947804 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
947805 earlier we did not know about the ill effects of child marriage but now we have decided to get our girls married only after 18 in the past our tribal people used to get married before they had turned 18
947806 i got married when i was 12 and i was not aware about child marriage now i have understood the adverse effects of it and will not allow our girls to get married before 18 and 21 years of age
947807 marriages in these tribal families used to take place girls used to get married even wen they had just stepped into their teens now in some villages around the district these tribals have planned not to get their girls married before the age of 18 years and also ensure that they visit the local maternity hospital right from the time of advanced stage of pregnancy to labour pains for proper pre natal and post natal care so it is a good message that is spreading in the nearby villages

947813 first step in providing the federal government siting authority that supplements existing state authority
947814 but it seems theres widespread and very diverse opposition to federally driven programs
947815 pakistans federally administered tribal areas fata are wilder than the wild west because al qaeda has resurfaced here in the form of a new breed of taliban who are threatening both afghanistan and pakistan
947816 it is imperative to understand how this has happened if we are to combat extremism
947817 for more than a year american intelligence reports have indicated that al qaeda is rebuilding in the tribal areas of pakistan however organizing counterterrorism programs has proven to be complicated for a variety of reasons including anti pakistani government sentiments in the federally administered tribal areas fata as well as growing jihadi ideals among the people
947818 only by retrieving the arrow and straightening its jagged edges and twisted feathers can muslims aspire to attain those high ethical values which are the embodiment of faith iman based on submission to god islam
947819 us pakistan relations have been difficult in the best of times they are today at a cross roads with grave consequences for the future course of the war on terror if losing afghanistan is out of the question for the usa and nato then it is vital to understand why losing pakistan is simply not an option if peace is to prevail in the world

947821 the ministry will provide good working conditions to them and in return they should give their best
947822 buying presents to impress women has been a key part of mating rituals in humans for some time but it appears that it is the act of generosity rather than the gift itself which is being used as a mating signal
947823 we have found in previous studies that women are attracted to generous men they seem to like heroic types for short term relationships but altruists for long term relationships
947824 generosity could be a way for men to show their suitability to invest in a relationship and help in rearing offspring
947825 data from our randomized placebo controlled trial involving a long duration of observation inject a note of caution into the debate regarding the use of gh therapy in the hiv population
947826 low dose physiological gh is well tolerated and results in significant but more modest reduction in visceral adipose tissue vat abdominal fat but is nonetheless associated with increased glucose levels

947830 ships officers recorded air pressure wind strength air and sea temperatures and other weather conditions from these records scientists can build a detailed picture of past weather and climate
947831 british archives contain more than 100 000 royal navy logbooks from around 1670 to 1850 alone they are a stunning resource
947832 global warming is a reality but our data show climate science is complex it is wrong to take particular events and link them to carbon dioxide emissions these records will give us a much clearer picture of what is really happening
947833 you know how tyra likes to do that stuff and shell get a lot of press off it
947834 perhaps the prime ministers staff feared that the attention of journalists was being drawn to the breast over his left shoulder rather than to what he was saying
947835 i can only hope berlusconi did not know about it
947836 a small number of elements tried to incite splittism create disturbances in themarket place and even trick the masses into an uprising

947841 we gain a lot from such goodwill operations because our knowledge will increase the indian army is doing a lot for our education
947842 we are feeling really good because we are going on this tour we will learn a lot meet new people and see new places we will get some knowledge out of this and see how thing are developing
947843 one of the several stories surrounding quan yin is that she was a buddhist who through great love and sacrifice during life had earned the right to enter nirvana after death however like avlokiteshvara while standing before the gates of paradise she heard a cry of anguish from the earth below turning back to earth she renounced her reward of bliss eternal but in its place found immortality in the hearts of the suffering
947844 los salarios no son los causantes de la ca da de la recaudaci n de los ingresos de las administraciones p blicas
947845 las rebajas fiscales que tan alegremente han impulsado tanto el gobierno nacional como el auton mico stas no fueron demandadas por los trabajadores ni se hicieron atendiendo a sus intereses y s en contra de sus reivindicaciones

947849 with these villages theres much more of a city mentality
947850 a lot of guys go from the villages into the city to work our church is in between two large council estates and so we have people with all the issues city people have
947851 unfortunately theres still much of a village mentality in many areas of life here so we dont have much provision for the needs of the people on these estates as a church weve taken this opportunity to get involved in those areas
947852 ive deliberately kept that on so i could stay in the community
947853 my role is to work with the 15 most prolific offenders in the new forest including the waterside of the new forest where the church is based my role is basically to try and change their lifestyle thats enabled me to see needs in the community that the church can meet

947857 i found mr kirman lying on the floor the injuries were horrendous
947858 they were down the right hand side of his neck it was obvious no one else was involved
947859 there had been quite a few illnesses in his family at the time and the doctor at his workplace thought there may have been some delayed reaction to the stress of family illness and prescribed him with sleeping tablets
947860 there is nothing to suggest he was anything other than in control of his mental faculties
947861 the fact is mr kirman took his own life and knew what he was doing

947892 severo era un romano y padre de romanos de acuerdo con la ley fue l mismo quien dijo que hab a visto una piedra en la cual se observaban las diferentes caras de la luna adoptando todo tipo de apariencias ora sta ora aqu lla creciendo y disminuyendo seg n el curso del sol y que tambi n llevaba impreso el mismo sol
947893 vi sigue diciendo severo un betilo movido por el aire a veces oculto entre mantas pero tambi n a veces llevado en las manos de un servidor el nombre de ese servidor que se encargaba del betilo era eusebios quien me dijo que s bitamente y de manera totalmente imprevista le hab a sobrevenido el deseo de salir de la ciudad de emesa casi en medio de la noche y de irse muy lejos hacia esa monta a en la que estaba enclavado el viejo y magn fico templo de atenas que hab a llegado muy r pido al pie de la monta a y que all se hab a sentado para reposar del cansancio de la ruta y que en ese mismo lugar hab a visto una bola de fuego que ca a del cielo con una velocidad muy grande y un le n enorme que se hallaba junto a la bola de fuego que el le n hab a desaparecido de s bito pero que l hab a corrido hasta la bola de fuego ya apagada la hab a tomado y era ese betilo y mientras lo llevaba le pregunt a qu dios pertenec a y le respondi que pertenec a a gennaios ese gennaios es adorado por los hieropolitanos que le erigieron en el templo de zeus una estatua en forma de le n lo hab a llevado a su casa esa misma noche y hab a recorrido una distancia no menor dec a de doscientos diez estadios
947894 era una bola perfectamente esf rica de un color blancuzco y su di metro med a un palmo pero en ciertos momentos aumentaba o disminu a su tama o en otros momentos adoptaba un color purpurino y nos mostr unas letras trazadas sobre la piedra te idas del color llamado minio o cinabrio luego ados el betilo a la pared y era por medio de esas letras que a quien lo interrogaba el betilo daba la respuesta buscada emit a voces en forma de un leve silbido que eusebios nos interpretaba
947895 severo contaba entro otras cosas durante su estancia en alejandr a que tambi n hab a visto una piedra heliaca no tal como las que nosotros vimos sino que lanzaba desde lo m s profundo de su masa unos rayos dorados que formaban un disco semejante al sol colocado en el centro de la piedra y que al principio ten a la apariencia de una bola de fuego de esta bola surg an rayos que iban hasta su circunferencia ya que toda la piedra ten a una forma esf rica tambi n hab a visto una piedra selenita no de aquellas en la que se ve aparecer una peque a luna s lo despu s de haberla hundido en el agua y que por eso se llaman hidroselenitas sino una piedra que por un movimiento propio e inherente a su naturaleza giraba cuando la luna giraba y de la manera como ella giraba obra realmente maravillosa de la naturaleza
947896 quienes ven an a honrar a la diosa afrodita salida de las aguas cuenta juvenal seg n el libro perdido llevaban presentes de oro y plata telas de lino biso y otros materiales preciosos y si esos presentes eran aceptados tanto los pa os como los objetos pesados se iban al fondo
947897 las tablillas oblongas de bronce perforadas por un agujero que permit a ensartarlas a la manera de los sortilegios etruscos y que llevaban respuestas triviales redactadas en lat n arcaico en una cadencia pr xima al hex metro conservaron para nosotros el valor de ejemplos de esos talismanes o sortilegios en los cuales viv an los or culos it licos
947898 la caballer a de aureliano hab a emprendido la retirada frente a emesa cuando una divinidad que s lo m s tarde fue conocida vino a alentar a nuestros soldados
947899 de regreso a roma hizo construir en honor del sol un templo cuya consagraci n fue hecha con la mayor magnificencia
947900 entonces aparecieron en roma esos vestidos cubiertos de pedrer as que vemos en el templo del sol esos dragones provenientes de persia esas mitras de oro
947901 el templo conserva objetos preciosos antiguas ofrendas una multitud de objetos maravillosos estatuas veneradas y dioses siempre presentes en efecto las estatuas sudan se mueven y emiten or culos
947902 a menudo dice luciano se escucha una voz en el santuario cuando el templo est cerrado muchos la han o do
947903 he visto contin a luciano el tesoro secreto del templo donde se conservan las reliquias las innumerables riquezas pa os objetos de oro y plata ordenados por separado
947904 adem s el templo contiene cuernos de elefantes alfarer a tejidos et opes en el vest bulo se ven dos enormes falos tambi n puede verse en el recinto del templo un hombrecito de bronce sentado provisto de un enorme miembro
947905 el emplazamiento mismo en donde se construy el templo de hier polis es una colina situada en medio de la ciudad
947906 all hay otro sacerdote de pie que le va repitiendo los nombres y en cuanto los escucha dice una oraci n por cada uno de ellos al orar golpea en un instrumento de bronce que produce un sonido estrepitoso y chill n
947907 el hombre no duerme se cuenta que si se quedara dormido un escorpi n llegar a hasta l y lo despertar a con una picadura dolorosa tal es el castigo atribuido a su sue o lo que se cuenta del escorpi n es santo y divino
947908 el templo mira al sol naciente por su forma y estructura se asemeja a los templos construidos en jonia
947909 del suelo se alza una base de una altura de dos brazas
947910 la estatua lleva sobre la cabeza un diamante denominado l mpara
947911 entre esas dos estatuas se ve una tercera tambi n de oro pero que no tiene nada en com n con las otras dos es el semei n sobre la cabeza soporta una paloma de oro
947912 cuando se entra en el templo a la izquierda se encuentra un trono reservado al sol pero la figura de ese dios no existe el sol y la luna son las dos nicas divinidades cuyas im genes no se muestran ellos dicen que es in til hacer estatuas de divinidades que todos los d as se muestran en el cielo
947913 los dioses no est n contenidos en los cuerpos sino que sus vidas y sus acciones divinas los contienen no est n orientados hacia los cuerpos sino que los cuerpos que contienen est n orientados hacia la causa divina
947914 solamente algunos negros algunos rojos y algunos amarillos permaneceran pero los hijos de la luz blanca se habran ido para siempre
947915 viv a como cortesana dice lampridio incapaz de resistir sus caprichos y todos hasta los m s m nimos esclavos enrojec an de sus libertinajes
947916 se sent a tan apegado a semiamira su madre dice lampridio que no hizo nada en la rep blica sin consultarla mientras que ella que viv a como una cortesana se abandonaba en el palacio a todo tipo de des rdenes por eso sus relaciones conocidas con antonio caracallus dejaban naturalmente algunas dudas sobre los or genes de varius o heliog balo incluso hay quienes llegan a decir que el nombre de varius le hab a sido dado por sus condisc pulos como nacido de una cortesana y por consecuencia de la mezcla de varias sangres
947917 mesa mujer ambiciosa en extremo y resuelta a arriesgarlo todo antes que permanecer en la oscuridad de la condici n privada en cuanto se enter de esas disposiciones favorables la de los soldados para con heliog balo se sinti en el deber de aprovecharlas empez por esparcir el rumor de que el joven heliog balo era no s lo pariente sino hijo de caracalla y sin temor a deshonrar a su hija dec a que este emperador la hab a matado y que por l ella hab a tenido todo tipo de favores y esta versi n impresion mucho a los soldados
947918 los pretorianos de macrino cuenta un historiador de la poca todos ellos gente escogida y tanto m s alerta y despierta por cuanto los hab an aligerado de lo que m s pesaba en sus armaduras combatieron con tanto valor que arremetieron contra sus enemigos y empezaron a sembrar la confusi n entre ellos
947919 tambi n se hizo iniciar dice lampridio en los misterios de la madre de los dioses y se atribuy el taurobolio para poder arrebatar la estatua de la diosa y sorprender todo cuanto serv a a su culto y que se manten a inviolablemente escondido a los profanos
947920 represent a venus llorando a adonis con todo el aparato de gemidos y contorsiones que en siria caracterizan el culto de salamb l mismo daba de esa manera un presagio de su fin cercano declaraba abiertamente que todos los dioses no eran m s que ministros del suyo asignando a unos el t tulo de ayudas de c mara a otros el de criados a otros diferentes empleos de servidores de su persona quiso hacer sustraer del templo de diana en laodicea las piedras llamadas divinas que hab a colocado orestes incluso la de la diosa misma que l hab a puesto en su santuario

947923 en un invierno que el emperador pas en nicomedia como all se comportara de la manera m s repugnante admitiendo que los hombres realizaran un rec proco comercio de infamias pronto los soldados se arrepintieron de lo que hab an hecho y recordaron con amargura que hab an conspirado contra macrino para consagrar ese nuevo pr ncipe entonces pensaron en poner sus miras en alejandro primo de ese mismo heliog balo y a quien el senado despu s de la muerte de macrino le hab a conferido el t tulo de c sar
947924 adem s se complac a en hacer representar la f bula de paris l mismo desempe aba el papel de venus y dejando caer de pronto su ropa a los pies completamente desnudo con una mano sobre el seno la otra sobre las partes genitales se arrodillaba y alzando la parte posterior la presentaba a los compa eros de libertinaje tambi n se arreglaba la cara como se pinta la cara de venus y cuidaba que todo su cuerpo estuviera perfectamente liso y brillante ya que estimaba que lo mejor que pod a ofrecerle la vida era ser considerado digno de satisfacer los gustos libidinosos de la mayor cantidad de hombres posible
947925 ya est parece decir lampridio esto es la anarqu a
947926 llegaba hasta a representar obscenidades con sus dedos dice lampridio acostumbrado como estaba a atacar todo pudor en las asambleas y en presencia del pueblo
947927 a la cabeza de sus guardias nocturnos dice lampridio puso al cochero gordius y nombr cuidador de los v veres a cierto claudius que era censor de las costumbres todos los otros cargos fueron distribuidos seg n recomendaba a las personas la enormidad de su miembro estableci procuradores del vig simo sobre las herencias a un muletero a un vagabundo a un cocinero a un cerrajero
947928 en los festines sigue contando lampridio preferentemente se colocaba al lado de los hombres prostituidos se complac a en sus tocamientos y nunca recib a la copa con mejor disposici n que de sus manos despu s que ellos hab an bebido
947929 hab a proyectado dice lampridio establecer en cada ciudad en calidad de prefectos a gente cuyo oficio ser a corromper a la juventud
947930 m s deuna vez observa nuevamente lampridio testimoni semejante desprecio por los senadores a quienes llamaba esclavos de toga el pueblo romano para l no era m s que el cultivador de un terreno y la orden de los caballeros no significaba nada

947933 dije tal cosa de usted esto es lo que escuch sobre usted tal cosa va a sucederle
947934 se cuenta sigue diciendo lampridio que ofreci naumaquias en lagos excavados por la mano del hombre a los que hab a llenado de vino y que los mantos de los combatientes estaban perfumados con esencia de enanto que condujo al vaticano carros uncidos a cuatro elefantes despu s de haber hecho destruir las tumbas que entorpec an su paso que en el circo para su espect culo particular hizo atar a los carros a cuatro camellos al mismo tiempo

948000 there is no doubt that the former president has his own faults and shortcomings for instance some of us feel embarrassed that chief obasanjo could not complete the ibadan ogbomoso dual carriage way before he left government despite his perceived excesses in some areas chief obasanjo a prominent yoruba son did his best for this nation and it is on record that he is the longest serving head of state in nigeria this should be a pride to the yoruba race
948001 i want to thank the us for the amount of assistance in terms of capacity building and training in relevant areas we have been receiving we have had it so good with the us that the joint exercise weve had cannot be quantified but like oliver twist we still need more opportunities we need assistance in the area of engineering and space technology
948002 we are here to seek not only training exchanges but offer opportunities for anybody in nigeria who will like to join the academy
948003 our focus is on leadership engineering and the sciences we spend lots of time resources in strong academic programmes we have trained three nigerian officers so far but we are willing to train more because we want to ensure enhanced security between our two navies especially as it pertains to better security for our maritime operations
948004 naturally when price increases and the peoples income do not increase as well it would affect the entire business and everybody as well
948005 the roads are bad there is no electricity as if we live in the jungle we lack proper medication and our leaders have to fly abroad at the slightest excuse no social security for the poor no mass transport no mass housing like those in the countries that have oil wealth
948006 they will never because it pays a deeply entrenched and powerful cartel in the presidency ministry and nnpc to ensure they do not function it pays them to import between 1998 and 2008 nigeria has awarded numerous contracts running into several hundred millions of dollars for their repair without commensurate results
948007 if nigeria government could not improve the standard of living of nigerians with that would they do that by the time they inflict more hardship on the citizens by increasing the pump price of fuel that they will fulfil their empty promises
948008 look at the roads in lagos for example is this their promised dividend of democracy
948009 please they should take her to the hospital to check her mental status because her action was a clear indication of a mental case that needs urgent attention
948010 the house felt it was better to give it to somebody from another zone who would not be jaundiced in his views on the issues
948011 everybody is asking questions about the federal government but there is the need to find out what other tiers of government the state and local governments have done with the money they have been collecting
948012 we have allegations of money being embezzled or money going into private pockets we must find out whether these go to where it they were supposed to go
948013 it is in a bid to keep the economy moving and because of the strong views of the president that we decided to work on the budget
948014 the focus of the amendment is to beef up infrastructural development in the country and facilitate the presidents 7 point agenda
948015 a lot of progress would be made by the end of the year
948016 im misunderstood and id want the world to know this and if ever i have exhibited behaviours that people dont like let it be known today that im born again and i have mended my ways
948017 the papers are an exposure i think it is the intelligentsia that is lacking the uninformed unexposed are in charge and as such criminality comes in i think the intellectuals should participate in the emancipation of the niger delta government is talking about the problems of the niger delta and getting it started but this conference is of a different kind what this conference has demonstrated is that where there is the good will where authorities of the nigerian government are ready the problem can be resolved
948018 because the speakers dwelt on the issue holistically talking about reports that were written as far back as in the late 60s comments that were made about the delta people who are from the delta who thought that there would never be a kind of intellectual beefing up of the people of the niger delta to warrant or to inform or fuel any kind of agitation against the exploration and exploitation of oil that will be detrimental to the environment of the niger delta to the people of niger delta as well as to the economy of the niger delta
948019 and if they take it far from the niger delta region you realise that nigeria is affected by the politics of oil i am happy there is a rethink concerning the niger delta summit i am also happy that they may have to be proactive in terms of appointing someone who can carry the project radically down to the roots down to the common man on the street down to those whose physical quality of life indexing are nothing to write home about in the niger dlta
948020 niger delta is not just about oil it is about human beings whatever happens there affects the human beings such as the green house effect
948021 bauchi can now get uranium and the way nigeria treats it may lead to sickness there you dont have to be a niger deltan to get into the struggle we are all niger deltans
948022 people should not be cynical about the niger delta the people here are not militants or kidnappers for 50 years shell has been prospecting for oil look at the road from ore to port harcourt is it how it should be other places are not so
948023 the oil companies are here prospecting for wealth all we need is equity fairness traditional rulers are also to blame
948024 this is an academic level there is relevance where there is intellectual discourse social and cultural reality so that is what it is asking the other is exploring in an imaginative and poetic level basically what is happening in the niger delta it is about the same thing for the good of the people so we may be using different means to update the niger delta problem nobody wants instability everybody wants peace and prosperity and the writer would want harmony to reign while the government and politicians want prosperity we are pursuing about the same thing in different ways in a way they should complement each other in different ways they should not be seen to be antagonistic
948025 when you talk of cultural leaders its not the so called traditional rulers many of them are ignorant and they dont know anything when you talk about the environment and the eco system what do they know but we can talk in comparative perspectives what is happening in other parts of the world like the amazon basin of brazil and other parts i feel the writers who are reflecting this area in their writing are more apt than the so called traditional leaders writers are the socio cultural leaders you are talking about because in 5 6 years or 100 years when most of them are no more who is going to remember some of those traditional rulers what they said on the ground the way people have warned that we should talk about the environment that is what matters they are talking of money money money but the environment the health is more important than the money the peace of the environment is more wholesome the healthier the earth the healthier we are the more polluted the earth the more polluted we are as well thats very important not only for us but even the children and the unborn child and so on they should pay more attention to not just the money coming out from oil but how can we maintain our environment to sustain it in a healthy way so that we ourselves could be healthy he asked
948026 any attempt to feel that they can solve this thing in a military term will not work the point is that from the basics to the oldest person is sympathetic with the fighters so there is no way you can really deploy them so its better we have peaceful way

948053 during the 1990s the national government contracted out the services at queen mary hospital in hanmer springs the most successful drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in the country which because of its nature of service and location was never going to work as a private operation
948054 the labour government then came along and under minister of health annette king proceeded to allow the closing of the facility and giving the ok for its sale
948055 this action and the support shown by the public was ignored by the minister and she gave the go ahead for the sale
948056 the alliance party would re establish these desperately needed treatment centers and ensure that they are adequately funded this would help to facilitate these people finding their way off the drugs and alcohol and getting back to being a positive contribution to our society

948098 under an alliance government a total of 3 57 billion dollars extra will be paid by the top 33 particularly those who earn over 100 000 per year but we give tax relief to the bottom 67 the break even point will be 41 000 that is a family with two wage earners each making that amount will pay no more tax
948099 the first 10 000 of income would be exempt from tax this applies to everyone but it would most benefit those on low incomes adjustments will be made so that those on government superannuation and benefits are included
948100 almost 900 thousand kiwis who earn between 10 000 and 20 000 would average 1400 less tax than they do now another 700 000 would enjoy substantial tax breaks those on 25 000 would pay 980 less and those on 35 000 would pay 430 less up to 34 000 60 of kiwis our tax relief for low income earners would be more favorable than that offer by labour effective 1 october 2008
948101 of this 1 545 billion would come from income tax and another 1 375 billion mainly from higher taxes on casino profits a carbon tax restoring the land tax abolished in 1992 and inheritance taxes at 20 cents in the dollar beginning at 500 000 we would introduce a capital gains tax modeled on australias that would afford another 1 billion
948102 the rest would come from stopping payments into the superfund 2 20 billion those payments are starving social spending and blighting new zealands future a healthy well educated fully employed people is the best guarantee we can support the elderly in dignity
948103 this 6 12 billion of extra income would fund free tertiary education universal student allowances abolition of school fees 22 000 state houses over three years and a universal child benefit of 15 per week the alliance would also treat a set percentage rising over three years of gdp as a dedicated towards first world health fund this would add around 1 4 billion dollars to the projected health vote
948104 it would pay for free doctor visits no prescription charges reduced waiting lists and meeting urgent needs in mental health aged care and disabilities it would provide free hearing and eye tests and free dental check ups
948105 the alliance would gradually replace gst starting with essentials such as food and put in its place a financial transactions tax ftt at the low rate of 2 cents per 100 the ftt would be charged on withdrawals only not deposits if you spent 29 000 per year and withdrew a weekly total of 560 ftt would be 11 cents compare that to gst on a familys weekly food bill 12 5 of 200 or 25 a week
948106 gst is a regressive tax that hits the poor at the same rate as the rich it burdens business with unnecessary compliance costs the alliance is committed to the kind of progressive tax system that existed in new zealand before labour and national decided to benefit the wealthy and attack the most vulnerable

948120 i think weve got a lot of speed out there and a lot of size with that speed
948121 you dont really know until the first game ive always said special teams 20 percent of it is doing the scheme and 80 percent is just the will
948122 hes more of an open field type using his space same thing with what makes him an effective wide receiver same reason why he doesnt play running back
948123 hes not a point of attack guy where youre going to just try and ram him up inside hes a guy that youre going to utilize the field and try to spread him out some again he brings something to the table in terms of kick return as well but right now we feel really good with what bookers got
948124 hes a guy that has great speed great speed and great vision very similar to the running back position he knows where the reads are on returns he knows where to break off of those reads
948125 one thing that we were questioning there was whether or not he would be able to break the tackles and hes shown out here during the live practice sessions that he is capable of breaking tackles running from scrimmage its obviously a little bit different on the kick return aspect of it youve got guys flying around coming downhill at him but we feel like he could definitely get the job done here
948126 please believe before we go down to pittsburgh for fridays preseason opener i will be having a conversation or two with my guy
948127 hes one of my best friends anyway but the guy is as good at kick returns as anybody
948128 more guys will have an opportunity to hit you on kick return as opposed to punt
948129 you can make one guy miss and be off to the races on a punt return i think it takes a certain toughness to be a kick returner
948130 the biggest thing i see people are coming down on kickoffs full speed you got to see a hole to envision a return
948131 punt returns you basically wait for the ball to come down and once you get it in your hands you can do a little more movement back there punt return is more open kickoffs you have to hit it and go

948137 pretty quickly we should get able to get a better evaluation on him once hes a little more comfortable his natural ability will show up

948139 hes looking to make the team any way he can
948140 its like wearing a visor except a visor gets wet and fogged up and everything
948141 its a little bit of a red tinge its just like wearing sunglasses its not a huge change it brings out the red and the green takes away the blue
948142 theyve kind of said through one of their front office guys that if favre did report they would potentially trade him within the division
948143 the bears just kind of are what they are i dont see him in detroit either at least the vikings offense is what hes used to old dogs dont learn new tricks especially in three weeks
948144 hes already carried this thing out too far its kind of a joke
948145 i said you know what it looks legit because its not some gimmick

948161 teachers are leaving the industry because of unrealistic workload expectations and a lack of resourcing by the ministry we cannot expect teachers to be effective if they are drowning in paperwork and spending more and more time fundraising

948169 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
948170 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
948171 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
948172 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
948173 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own

948181 if you have five rookies on your offense youre going to have some offensive mistakes there and its going to cost you at some point or another
948182 same thing that we ran into with special teams last year we had some great athletes on the field but one guy would make a mistake and it would look like the whole scheme was busted
948183 its a lot easier for the guys that have been out there that have been in the battles to understand the little concepts of the game even a center trying to pick out and rub a guy off
948184 we still may hold a few guys out in different practices as we go along were getting worn down a little bit
948185 right now we need to get the fluid out of his knee and get that thing settled down a little bit
948186 oh did you say the moutain hardwear goat jacket yeah i know that one has the fleece liner and the built in martini bar in the inside pocket

948191 cuando dej mi vida de empleado administrativo para dedicarme de lleno al arte me di cuenta de que la libertad adquirida implicaba una gran responsabilidad de ninguna manera quer a abusar del arte para lograr una liberaci n personal que me asimilase al artista clich rebelde y marginal si no que al contrario quer a permanecer en mi propia realidad peque o burguesa para tratarla desde adentro con conocimiento de causa por eso no he dejado de utilizar herramientas y m todos similares a los de cualquier empleado administrativo trabajando siempre de manera rutinaria y con la rutina como foco tem tico
948192 n o estou sabendo de nada sei que se for uma proposta boa a diretoria do cruzeiro vai me dizer meu empres rio wilson gottardo tamb m n o passou nada para mim mas meu sonho me transferir para a europa um dia se for para um clube grande como o werder bremen onde est o diego e naldo ficaria bastante satisfeito
948193 fiz todos os testes com ele e n o parece ser uma les o muscular s o os efeitos de uma pancada mas pedi um exame para ter uma posi o mais definitiva a respeito n o se falou em corte e ainda n o se fala a respeito disso
948194 n s n o estamos completamente cientes desta situa o o bocog precisa conferir com os comit s nacionais mas somos firmemente contra a venda ilegal de entradas da olimp ada
948195 a venda internacional de ingressos ser executada pelos comit s nacionais ou agentes autorizados por eles
948196 buscamos alertar sobre fraudes e pedir que todos comprem suas entradas por meios legais
948197 o governo determinou como pr mio u 40 mil cerca de r 62 4 mil e as empresas privadas e patrocinadores outros u 500 mil aproximadamente r 780 7 mil por uma medalha de ouro
948198 n s n o falamos de medalhas falamos de metas esperamos chegar com 16 atletas a 7 ou 8 finais
948199 al m do incentivo em dinheiro tamb m ser o distribu das bolsas de estudos vital cias em universidades para os medalhistas
948200 temos em frente um enorme desafio no nosso grupo o mais dif cil do torneio isso n o segredo
948201 a prepara o para os jogos ol mpicos serviu como catalisador para pequim
948202 moradores de pequim s o os que mais v o se beneficiar
948203 no momento o governo chin s n o completamente aberto e transparente sobre como ele gasta seu dinheiro
948204 vale a pena investir porque esta uma oportunidade para o mundo compreender a china e para n s entretermos o mundo
948205 n s n o dever amos avaliar as olimp adas olhando apenas para quanto elas custam
948206 a torcida tem o direito de cobrar pois paga ingresso e vinha nos apoiando quer amos retribuir o carinho do torcedor mas n o estamos conseguindo
948207 perdemos tr s jogadores e ainda tivemos les es do kl berson e do tardelli algumas contrata es n o aconteceram temos que administrar a falta de jogadores
948208 foi bom ele estrear fazendo gol em uma bela cabe ada
948209 n o sei quais esportes deveriam se ver submetidos a press o para 2020 mas importante que o comit mantenha no programa os esportes que s o populares atrativos para as pessoas jovens que tenham o elemento de treinamento e que sejam atrativos para transmitir em meios de comunica o
948210 os esportes ol mpicos devem ser competitivos emocionantes e atrativos para o p blico
948211 devem se realizar em um n vel alto de valores como o esp rito esportivo jogo limpo respeito pelas regras e pelos rbitros
948212 se n o acontecer assim os jovens atletas que quisessem participar de uma olimp ada n o teriam certeza sobre quais seriam os jogos que estariam presentes quando atingirem a maturidade esportiva
948213 eu prefiro n o me expor melhor falar com a diretoria mas vou explicar para o torcedor o santos est com uma redu o de despesas e o fab o est nesta lista

948220 and appeared clear of mental illness so why did he do it
948221 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
948222 die schlussfolgerung des kontraste films dass ber genetische risiken gerade in risikogruppen aufgekl rt werden solle teilen wir durch den gesamten beitrag k nnte jedoch der eindruck erweckt werden dass mukoviszidose und andere vererbte erkrankungen vorwiegend durch die verwandtenehe von migranten entsteht wir m chten daher aufkl ren zum beispiel mukoviszidose als rezessiv vererbte erkrankung kann mit einer wahrscheinlichkeit von 25 prozent immer dann auftreten wenn beide eltern tr ger der erbanlage sind die ganz berwiegende mehrheit der mukoviszidose betroffenen in deutschland kommt aus deutschen familien denn von den knapp 200 neu diagnostizierten mukoviszidose erkrankungen im jahr beziehen sich lediglich drei prozent auf menschen mit t rkischer abstammung mag man die verwandtenehe aus vielen gr nden zu recht ablehnen ist es jedoch unverantwortlich menschen die mit einer vererbten erkrankung leben f r den kampf gegen diese institution zu instrumentalisieren
948223 es wird berhaupt nicht unterschieden zwischen der verantwortlichen pr ventiven genetischen beratung vor der entscheidung f r eine partnerschaft mit kindern und der vorgeburtlichen diagnostik mit dem ziel die geburt des kindes zu verhindern unsere aufgabe als patientenorganisation achse e v ist es gegen die erkrankungen und nicht gegen die daran erkrankten zu k mpfen unser wunsch ist es dass die ffentlichkeit diese maxime mit tr gt
948224 it was a delightful surprise and a tremendous honor for me to receceive a comment like this from a famous writer
948225 art direction go with something like the dreamwave re envisions
948226 yeah im not important enough to say anything about that though i honestly wish i knew it would really help my job
948227 that figure set by the government is a minimum figure it is not a ceiling which should not be exceeded
948228 we have got to identify a 15 year supply of land which is ready for this development
948229 there is not enough brownfield sites we cannot be speculative we must show that land has been identified and is available for the homes which need to be built
948230 i like what ive seen but what we have to remember is that aleksandrs is contracted to his club back home olimps riga so first and foremost we must speak to them and be very respectful of that
948231 we will find out what the situation is anyone who has seen those games has seen hes a young talent hes got a few attributes in his locker and i think he will only get better so well weigh everything up and speak to all the parties involved and see where that takes us
948232 hes got pace and seems to have a very good awareness of the game and im always looking for that
948233 il ny a avit jamais eu daccord entre nous auparavant
948234 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
948235 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
948236 i have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore i do not trust the system at all
948237 the classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus whats invested in the roads and the transport system it goes into a black hole
948238 little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used
948239 the things that paul writes about are all opposites of one another the edges let me explain
948240 thats the one she did it take her in and take her kids from her too
948241 do not be intimidated they only wanted to be loved i made sure i smiled and made personal contact with anybody i could but it made me wonder if i have ever made somebody feel that way when i am not the minority things that make you go hummmmmm
948242 they should take a look at how queer they look before they look at me
948243 oh i guess your not a big chiefs fan this season
948244 oh yeah jon quinn i know him well not personally but i have followed him for some time i travel a lot so the first time i saw him was in the european league really nice guy but an even better man i really like what that guy stands for
948245 oh come one sure you know who im talking about whatever
948246 you wont believe me its two girls taking pics of each other is lingerie
948247 its an economical car its good on gas pretty much i like the style of it also for a small car
948248 as we were choosing between cars the output on the mileage was still a major concern
948249 i have low income and this helps me a lot and without it i dont think id be able and ive been here for six or seven years and i think without daycare i wont be able to work because i would need somebody to watch my kids
948250 regeringsst tten vil betyde at tv2 danmark kan forts tte med sine aktiviteter endnu en tid jeg vil n r den tid kommer se p om der er truffet foranstaltninger som kan sikre dens levedygtighed p lang sigt

948252 virkningen af faldet i r varepriserne for den globale inflation er betydelig
948253 the lasting memory of that day was the violence and explosion of energy of the impact between the two cars
948254 i can remember seeing a white car sliding sideways into my lane at horrendous speed i cant even recall breaking because it happened so fast
948255 i could feel the car spinning around in the road until it came to a sudden stop in the barriers
948256 there was heat and lots of fine dust which came from air bags
948257 i tried to open the door but i knew i would never have been able to get out of the car because of the searing pain in my back
948258 when i was in the car the morphine the paramedics gave me didnt even touch the pain
948259 there was such an unbearable feeling in my back it was dreadful
948260 i was feeling awful with a temperature the shivers fever and sickness
948261 at one point i had four drips saline morphine anti biotics and the blood transfusion
948262 i have had all my stitches out of my leg and the staples have come out of my back but im not under any illusions about how long its going to take
948263 the pain killers are effective and i can walk to a certain extent sitting up is more painful than anything else
948264 if i stay in one position for too long it gets painful and i have to lie down when i wake up in the morning in bed i just ache all over
948265 both of my legs are numb from the knees down which was caused by the pressure on the nerves in my back
948266 it may be a result of the surgery but they cant say for sure that the feeling is going to go it could be a long term thing
948267 i am taking things day by day every day i feel my legs getting a little bit stronger
948268 a few miles an hour more or a few degrees at a different angle and it could have been totally different
948269 i could have come out of it ten different ways and they are all worse than how i ended up
948270 i cant get past the accident itself whatever happened before that has not entered my head
948271 i feel i have been so lucky that i cant think of anything negative to say about anyone
948272 its only when something like this happens that you realise how many people are involved in your treatment and recovery
948273 i would like to thank so many special people that carry out their work day in day out without even knowing the profound effect they have on peoples lives
948274 i would like to thank the police who were first on the scene and for their visits to me and the support they gave to my family throughout my stay in hospital
948275 the paramedics for trying to keep me relaxed while treating my injuries when i was still inside the car
948276 both firefighting crews that attended the crash and who cut me out of the car as quickly and gently as my injuries would allow
948277 to all the a and e staff for my initial assessment and treatment and also that day the mri cat scans and x ray teams
948278 both surgical teams that carried out work to my legs and back it must be second nature to them but to me its a miracle what they do every day
948279 the biggest heartfelt thanks needs to go to all the staff on the saxmundham ward at ipswich hospital
948280 finally to my partner in crime oliver in the next bed who was admitted the same day with a broken back who over the next two weeks without being able to move kept me sane and positive
948281 i treasure our friendship and look forward to seeing us both up and about
948282 the response from family friends work colleges and unknown well wishers via the evening star e mail address has been a great boost to my family and i would also like to thank the evening star for the sensitive way they have gone about reporting the accident and the subsequent follow ups
948283 i feel honoured and extremely humbled by the people ive met over last three weeks and not to mention a little ashamed that its taken this accident to release how many special people are carrying out their extraordinary jobs from day to day
948284 i got to the lights at the end of the road and could see part of woodbridge road had been closed
948285 i couldnt take it in i thought this cant be robs accident
948286 i couldnt understand how the crash could be so big because i knew rob couldnt have been travelling very fast
948287 he knew daddy had a poorly back and they spoke on the phone but he couldnt really work out where he was
948288 we have always done things together so charlie found it really hard because he didnt have daddy around
948289 his behaviour changed so much that it meant i couldnt leave him to go and visit rob
948290 since robs been back charlies been so good its amazing how a two year old can take it all in

948340 i used to sit at home with my friends in high school and watch kentucky fried movie and airplane and vomit from laughing
948341 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
948342 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
948343 if he had been a republican president we would have demanded his resignation and marched on the white house
948344 when 9 11 happened i knew democrats wouldnt be strong enough to fight this war
948345 this morning i had another talk with the german chancellor herr hitler here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine
948346 that negotiation went well fifty million dead worldwide nicely done mr chamberlain
948347 next item you must agree to stop supplying the explosive devices that are killing our american soldiers in iraq
948348 i figured he was like everyone else in hollywood a democrat
948349 and we knew that this was not a democrat movie
948350 we were afraid that he would not want to be involved in something that was so directly taking on the left and that he would not want to play the michael moore character
948351 i thought that the minute we started talking about politics that would be the end
948352 there was this dance that we did a dance familiar to conservative actors in hollywood lots of actors have done it
948353 i usually just bite my tongue unless it gets too ridiculous
948354 the only thing that really bothers me is when they go off about the president it just gets annoying

948357 the accepted way to speak about america is in the voice that disrespects it and the voice thats unacceptable is the one that loves america
948358 petraeus has to couch every bit of optimism in some convoluted formulation to avoid the promised rush of disrespect
948359 no one on the left wants to admit that radical islamists want to kill americans the jews everyone in the west
948360 i try to talk to my friends on the left and they just dont get it most of them have never even heard of sayyid qutb how can you have an intellectual discussion about the war were in without knowing who sayyid qutb is
948361 once they found out i was a republican unfortunately for some people it was a problem
948362 its almost like people who are gay show up at the baths and say oh i didnt know you were gay
948363 its too dark outside the sun is not the answer
948364 we really didnt have to do a lot of stretching
948365 radical christianity is just as threatening as radical islam in a country like america where we have a separation of church and state
948366 obama is not qualified to be president and itll be a disaster
948367 i dont think that obama is an evil guy i just think hes wrong but i do think we face real evil in ahmadinejad and the mullahs and all these crazy guys
948368 john kerry was and obama is fortunately kerry was a stiff but obama isnt a stiff and hes really adaptable hes like a really clever virus who adapts obamas the farthest left of all of these guys and thats why he associated with all of those crazies terrorists preachers of hate

948426 well what qualities or unique properties can we assign to music

948429 i plan to have a baby in a year and quit
948430 i became frustrated when co workers did not get items to me in a timely manner so i created a reminder message which i send to them in advance so they were aware of the timeline and it has greatly reduced my frustration and helped the relationships i have with others they have even thanked me for the reminders
948431 i am not as organized as i would like to be it proved a detriment to me at my last job as part of my job was to reply to patron emails in a timely manner and for a time some of those emails seemed to get lost in the cracks until i would finally get around to cleaning out my inbox months later it frustrated me as much as anyone finally i decided to use my email software as a tool instead of looking at it as a detriment to my job i learned how to use folders i learned how to use categories to mark things i still needed to do which were patron requests and which were internal i could mark which ones were urgent and which ones could wait i learned how to turn things into tasks so that it would remind me to follow up on certain emails it was very liberating i went from being super disorganized to following up on patrons concerns even after they were solved just to make sure they were still happy with the result

948438 two dutch climbers were brought by our people and their colleagues down to base camp from an altitude of 7 300 metres overnight
948439 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
948440 our four high altitude porters left a while ago and it is expected that they will bring the italian climber down this evening
948441 badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
948442 at least 11 climbers have died this is one of the worst incidents in the history of k2 climbing
948443 i have carried down both living and dead people from the mountain
948444 i was terrified that the pakistani would pull us all off the cliff and screamed to him to use his ice axe but he lost his grip and plummeted off a 300 metre cliff

948465 from all this i am beginning to have a rather better understanding of what i am but it still appears and i cannot stop thinking this that the corporeal things of which images are formed in my thought and which the senses investigate are known with much more distinctness than this puzzling i which cannot be pictured in the imagination and yet it is surely surprising that i should have a more distinct grasp of things which i realize are doubtful unknown and foreign to me than i have of that which is true and known of my own self

948487 its of no importance to me what anyone thinks of my participation
948488 whats important is awareness of the facts and issues i truly believe when people have access to information for the most part they will make wise decisions
948489 it was naive of me not to realize that of course and unfortunately short sighted greed and opportunism would step right up to the plate as usual and heavily invest in going down a bad road
948490 its almost inconceivable that some would choose to do things like burn rainforests in malaysia to plant palm plantations or make bio fuels that compete with basic food supplies
948491 we absolutely need bio fuels to play a part in solving our energy crisis demands but its essential to make them sustainably
948492 im glad the message is finally getting across but i was not prepared for the enormous amounts of dollars and energy that has gone into producing bio fuels in an unsustainable manner
948493 both jess and lisa have had an incredibly difficult week and without doubt i am talking to them and helping them out where i can
948494 from the whole situation with the pictures to lisas break up with dean i cant even imagine how they are coping with it all
948495 what has happened with those images is obviously completely illegal and there are lawyers getting involved
948496 its just such an upsetting situation there is a real tall poppy situation in australia and both jess and lisa deserve more support especially from their australian fans

948500 the main benefit of the lift magic site is that it allows you to see a retouched version of your photo in literally seconds its easy fun and virtually effortless
948501 the directors have considered the proposal and believe it undervalues the business
948502 in our opinion the indicative proposal of a 4 40 a share is a low balled bid that significantly undervalues asciano
948503 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value

948524 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
948525 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
948526 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
948527 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
948528 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
948529 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
948530 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
948531 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
948532 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him

948534 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
948535 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
948536 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
948537 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
948538 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
948539 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
948540 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad

948550 a lot of seniors donated their time to build this center

948566 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes

948568 its more technical its steeper the weather is more intense
948569 were not immune to the difficulties posed by the market turbulence but when you stand back from the short term difficulties i think its also important to say to ourselves two things one weve had a very robust set of results in all of the circumstances and two were pursuing were implementing a strategy which is as valid as ever and which will deliver strong performance over the medium and longer term
948570 everything he touches turns to crap including the daftass tosser from illinois whos about to suffer a career prang of cosmic proportions

948572 weve been worried about his state of mind for some time well being the worlds most wanted man for nearly seven years is bound to take its toll
948573 it restores your faith in great britain that despite those bozos making so much money from running the lottery the normal man in the street except when russell brand is in the street because hes not really very normal can ultimately benefit from being honest
948574 it also demonstrates to the youth of today that if they are honest they will be rewarded so i say to all manchester teenagers in future if the police ask if it is your knife be honest
948575 when i found the lottery ticket blowing down the concourse of the bus station this morning my first thought was to furtively shove it in my pocket and rush home although rusholme is only just up the road from stretford
948576 however my parents and their parents before them didnt fight in two world wars for their son to simply steal someone elses property in fact my parents and their parents actually didnt fight in either war but thats another story

948583 but i do hope that even if the ruling is against the players that the clubs would say ok we are now right and weve a right to attack fifa but let the players play

948800 may sri nityananda rama be the object of my constantremembrance sankarsana mahavisnu garbhodaksayivisnu and ksirodaksayi visnu as well as sesa are his expansions and the expansions of his expansions
948801 i surrender unto the lotus feet of sri nityananda rama who is known as sankarsana in the midst of thecatur vyuha he has full opulences and resides in vaikunthaloka far beyond the material creation
948802 i offer my full obeisances unto the feet of sri nityanandarama whose partial representation calledkaranodakasayi visnu lying on the karana ocean is theoriginal purusa the master of the illusory energy and theshelter of all the universes
948803 i offer my full obeisances unto the feet of sri nityanandarama a partial part of whom is garbhodaksayi visnu from the navel of garbhodaksayi visnu sprouts the lotusstem that is the birthplace of brahma the engineer of theuniverse the stem of that lotus is the resting place of themultitude of planets
948804 i offer my full obeisances unto the feet of sri nityanandarama whose secondary part is the visnu lying in theocean of milk that ksirodaksayi visnu is the supersoul ofall living entities and the maintainer of all the universe sesa naga is his further sub part
948805 simply by talking of nityananda prabhu one awakens hislove for krsna thus all his bodily limbs are agitated byecstasy and tears flow from his eyes like the waters of theganges
948806 in this incarnation lord nityananda is carefully hidden only if lord caitanya himself reveals him can anyone seelord nityananda
948807 your name is nityananda your form is also nityananda or full of eternal nitya bliss ananda you are nityanandabecause you are lord balarama personified
948808 with great bliss you wander here and there you eat and you act in different ways there is never a time whenyou are not blissful
948809 by lord nityanandas mercy one attains devotion tolord visnu krsna please know that lord nityanandahas all the power of lord krsna
948810 lord nityananda is not different from lord krsna lordnityananda is lord krsnas associate friend couch ornaments and kinsmen
948811 even the vedas cannot approach lord nityanandaspastimes lord nityananda is the father of all livingentities he is their protector and their friend
948812 his every action is filled with the nectar of love for lordkrsna by serving lord nityananda one attains pure loveand devotion to lord krsna
948813 therefore with great devotion please tie around yourheads these pieces of lord nityanandas kaupina takethem home and worship them with care
948814 one who has faith and devotion for lord nityananda hasfaith and devotion for me lord caitanya also
948815 lord siva and lord brahma bow down before lordnityanandas feet therefore all of you should place yourlove in lord nityanandas feet
948816 nityananda the wandering mendicant is the foremost ofall the servants of lord caitanya
948817 one who would cross over the ocean of materialexistence and swim in the bhakti ocean should worship thelotus feet of nityananda
948818 lord nityananda alone possesses the distinctive function of the guru nityananda is the servant of god serving gaurasundara by the distinctive method of reverential servitude he is identical with sri balarama of krishna lila sri balarama is not a chum of krishna but his respected elder brother individual souls are under the direction of nityananda they receive the service of sri gaurasundara or krishna at his hands nityananda is the ultimate source of the jiva and the jiva is a potency of nityananda nityananda and his companions form one of the five groups of the associates of lord caitanya whose distinctive function is that of guru but nityananda does not directly instruct in the confidential service of krishna srimati radhika is the guru of the inner circle of the servants of krishna srimati radharani however accepts the offering of service of only those souls who are especially favored by nityananda and are deemed by him to be fit for her service there is therefore a most intimate relationship between the function of nityananda and that of srimati radharani
948819 these two brothers gaura and nitai are like one body they are identical manifestations if you do not believe inlord nityananda you will fall down
948820 we are all asking about the mercy of lord nityananda nityananda is supposed to be the original spiritual master so we have to approach gauranga lord caitanya through the mercy of lord nityananda what is the symptom of a person who has achieved the causeless mercy of lord nityananda narottama dasa thakur says that the symptom of one who has actually received the causeless mercy of lord nityananda is that he has no more material desire samsara basana means desire for material enjoyment and narottama dasa wonders when it will become very insignificant of course as long as we have bodies we have to accept so many material things but not in the spirit of enjoyment but only to keep body and soul together
948821 my dear lord nityananda you are always joyful in spiritual bliss since you always appear very happy i have come to you because i am most unhappy if you kindly put your glance over me i may also become happy
948822 lord nityananda freely offered this exhalted prema which is difficult for lord brahma to attain even to thefallen and wretched souls who did not desire it
948823 if you actually want to approach the association ofradha krsna you must achieve the mercy of lordnityananda first
948824 in this connection one prayer by rupa gosvami is sufficient to exemplify this hopefulness
948825 i have no love for krishna nor for the causes of developing love of krishna namely hearing and chanting and the process of bhakti yoga by which one is always thinking of krishna and fixing his lotus feet in the heart is also lacking in me as far as philosophical knowledge or pious works are concerned i dont see any opportunity for me to execute such activities but above all i am not even born of a nice family therefore i must simply pray to you gopijana vallabha krishna maintainer and beloved of the gopis i simply wish and hope that some way or other i may be able to approach your lotus feet and this hope is giving me pain because i think myself quite incompetent to approach that transcendental goal of life
948826 everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by hrishikesa the master of the senses and by the result of the work in which one is engaged the supreme personality of godhead sri krishna should be worshiped if one thinks always in this way in full krishna consciousness then by the grace of the lord he becomes fully aware of everything that is the perfection of life the lord says in bhagavad gita 12 7 tesham aham samuddharta the supreme lord himself takes charge of delivering such a devotee that is the highest perfection of life in whatever occupation one may be engaged if he serves the supreme lord he will achieve the highest perfection

948846 it it very urgently required to translate and publish the books about the pastimes of lord shri gauranga mahaprabhu into all the languages of the world
948847 this is so urgently necessary because in a very short time lord chaitanya mahaprabhu will become the sole object of worship or the supreme worshippable lord in all the villages towns and cities of the world if this books about his pastimes are available in various languages people can read and hear them regularly and thus constantlyincrease and nourish their faith in the supreme personality of godhead lord shri gauranga mahaprabhu
948848 please keep this gauranga lila very secret until lord gauranga completes his pastimes in this world after this the whole world will get the great treasure of gaurangas name and pastimes
948849 the advent of the age of kali is most auspicious because in the near future the most wonderful and enchanting holy names and pastimes of lord shri gauranga mahaprabhu will be most openly and widely established and broadcasted
948850 my name of gauranga will be broadcasted and glorified in all various towns villages cities countries and continents of the world

948854 i am not my body i am a spirit soul aham brahmasmi
948855 when a person becomes brahman realized when he understands he is a spirit soul the first benefit is that he becomes free from all kinds of hankering and lamentation
948856 within a day or two an exalted personality will come here
948857 today i had a wonderful dream i saw a beautiful chariot with a flag on top that came and stopped near my door within that chariot there was a remarkable personality he carried a large pillar on his shoulder and appeared restless he had a stick tucked into his clothes and carried a pitcher in his left hand he dressed in blue garments with a blue cadara on his chest a wonderful earring hung on his left ear by his features i assume he is none other than haladhara balarama
948858 i have never seen such a noble and powerful personality he was effulgent and dressed as an avadhuta or mendicant i was severely stunned by seeing him i asked him nwho are you he smilingly replied ni am your brother we will meet and know each other tomorrow hearing his words my happiness increased i consider myself as similar to that personality
948859 please listen o gosai the wine that you are asking for is right here in front of you only those you give it to can relish it
948860 i have a feeling in my heart that some holy personality has arrived in navadvipa i already told all of you that we would meet him soon o haridasa o shrivasa pandita go and find out who has come and where has he come from
948861 we did not find the stranger in navadvipa we looked in the houses of sannyasis vaishnavas jnanis and atheists we saw the entire navadvipa but did not go to villages outside navadvipa
948862 hes now staying at nandana acaryas house come with me were going there im telling you the truth
948863 wearing a peacock feather ornament upon his head blue karnikara flowers on his ears a yellow garment as brilliant as gold and the vaijayanti garland lord krishna exhibited his transcendental form as the greatest of dancers as he entered the forest of vrindavana beautifying it with the marks of his footprints he filled the holes of his flute with the nectar of his lips and the cowherd boys sang his glories
948864 o krishna please save him o krishna please save him
948865 where were you i have searched the entire world but could not get any news of you finally i heard that the son of nanda maharaja is living at navadvipa in gauda desa hiding his real identity i have come here to catch this thief today i have caught you how will you escape
948866 this is contradictory lord ananta always carries visvambhara on his lap today his pride has been smashed in the lap of the lord
948867 today is a very auspicious day for me i have seen with my own eyes pure devotional symptoms that are the essence of the four vedas this shivering flowing of tears and loud shouting are not possible for anyone except one who is empowered by the lord if one personally sees this pure devotional service krishna will never reject him i am firmly convinced that you are the full manifestation of the lords energy by worshipping you a living entity achieves devotion to lord krishna you can purify the fourteen worlds your qualities are inconceivable unfathomable and confidential there is no one existing who can defy you you are the form of love of krishna the treasury of devotional service if anyone meets you even for a moment he will be delivered even if he committed millions of sins i think krishna has a desire to deliver me that is why he brought you to me by huge fortune i have seen your lotus feet by worshipping you i will most surely get the treasure of love of krishna
948868 i am afraid to ask you where are you from
948869 i have traveled to many holy places i have also seen all the holy places where krishna did his pastimes i saw only the holy places but could not find krishna there i asked some exalted personality nwhy do i see only thorns the places of pastimes are all empty and covered can you tell me where krishna went he told me that krishna has gone to bengal recently he was at gaya but now has returned to navadvipa i have heard that joyous sankirtana of the holy names is being done in nadia some people say that lord narayana has appeared here i have also heard that nadia is famous for the deliverance of the fallen souls so being most sinful as i am i have come here
948870 we are all immensely fortunate to see a pure devotee like yourself today we are most satisfied having seen the flow of your tears of ecstasy
948871 o lord we are confused hearing words such as nyour and nour spoken by you
948872 how can we understand their dealings just as it is hard to understand how krishna and siva worship each other
948873 o shrivasa pandita what you say is right their qualities resemble that of rama and lakshmana
948874 i dont know much about them but i have a feeling that ananta sesha has taken shelter of the lap of krishna
948875 they are just like the two friends krishna and arjuna as they exchanged such affection
948876 it appears that they are closely related to each other whatever they speak is through gestures only
948877 every one of you what is your realization you write your realization what you have realized about krishna that is required it is not passive always you should be active whenever you find time write never mind two lines four lines but you write your realizations sravanam kirtanam writing or offering prayers glories this is one of the functions of a vaisnava you are hearing but you have to write also then writing means smaranam remembering what you have heard from your spiritual master

948879 it is important that theres a clear environmental signal but we have to be mindful of the fact that we are all taxpayers we are all motorists
948880 we are surprised that the treasury has risked provoking political opposition for an environmental measure which according to its projections is of limited benefit
948881 that the treasury had not calculated what the impacts of the ved budget changes will be on emissions from secondhand cars when this was one of the main objectives of the changes
948882 breeds suspicion about their objectives increasing the perception of them as revenue raising measures with no environmental purpose
948883 its really exciting to see whats going to come next and how merediths going to deal with living with a boy and all the things a man like derek who has been married and is a grown up might expect
948884 they are definitely on a journey and its going to be a really interesting one also both actresses are so game theyre so willing to do something
948885 rest assured she wont make any rash decisions with regards their marriage balthazar is incredibly confused at the moment torn in fact as time goes by he realises how deep his love for rosetta and their children is rosetta thinks the bond she has with him and their kids is stronger than anything sienna can offer despite reports to the contrary the door is still wide open for a reconciliation
948886 jerseys future rests in following international standards in this area
948887 our goal is for all people regardless of gender sexuality ethnicity or other such things to have the freedom to create their own identity and be respected for their personal qualities
948888 many parents feel forced to change he to she or she to he and other details as they read stories for their children because so many details in childrens books are so very traditional
948889 based on prejudice or traditional gender roles that rein in individual freedom
948890 break down traditional gender roles and offer children broader role models allowing them to be all they can be
948891 for both vilda and olika their values are the top priority and i think that is simply the wrong approach when you want to make good childrens books
948892 you cannot write a book simply because you want it to be gender equal you can however write a good book that is gender equal but as soon as you can see the thought behind the book i think the artistic side has failed
948893 it is perfectly possible to make good literature that takes these issues into consideration
948894 we have good authors and illustrators and we insist there is a good story that is absolutely the most important thing
948895 portraying a gay family in a story that is not simply about gay families shows that these families exist too and are just as normal as other types of families
948896 i really cant see how that can affect the quality of the story itself
948897 i guess there are people who really feel very threatened when you try to open up perceptions on sexuality and gender identity
948898 prerequisite that they only take in authors with the same perspective that affects their access to books in a way that just isnt good
948899 some people come into our lives and quickly go some people become friends and stay awhile leaving beautiful footprints on our hearts and we are never quite the same because we have made a good friend
948900 people come into your life for a reason a season or a lifetime when you figure out which one it is you will know what to do for each person when someone is in your life for a reason it is usually to meet a need you have expressed they have come to assist you through a difficulty to provide you with guidance and support to aid you physically emotionally or spiritually they may seem like a godsend and they are they are there for the reason you need them to be then without any wrongdoing on your part or at an inconvenient time this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end sometimes they die sometimes they walk away sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand what we must realize is that our need has been met our desire fulfilled their work is done the prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move on then people come into your life for a season because your turn has come to share grow or learn they bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh they may teach you something you have never done they usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy believe it it is real but only for a season lifetime relationships teach you lifetime lessons things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation your job is to accept the lesson love the person and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life

948906 jefferson on principle refused to acknowledge the courts right to force the executive to produce information
948907 constantly trudging from north to south amp east to west
948908 unauthorized by the constitution without the sanction of congress to go beyond the line of defence
948909 an indemnity from the people through their representatives in congress
948910 contrary to popular belief jefferson believed in an independent presidency with inherent powers
948911 madisons low performance is attributable in part to his narrow view of his constitutional powers as president

948915 we are french workers just without any rights yes were citizens because france owned all of black africa
948916 their action is legitimate theyve been here for years working contributing to the social security system paying taxes and were satisfied with their work
948917 today these people are recognized for what they are workers they are developing class consciousness our role as a union is to show that these people are not outside the world of work

948925 on monitoring the crinan canal sea lock following its closure for a temporary repair it has become clear that although the repair itself is sound other parts of the lock cill are now giving cause for concern
948926 as public safety is at the forefront of our operations british waterways scotland has taken the decision to close the lock once again to minimise any risk
948927 we will not be accepting vessels through the crinan canal certainly for the next few days
948928 one cannot obtain krsna bhakti or the devotional service of the lord by official execution of the vedic rituals
948929 who has been elevated without rendering service to a pure vaishnava
948930 the person who has not at any time received upon his head the dust from the feet of a pure devotee of the lord is certainly a dead body
948931 the dust of the feet of a devotee the water that has washed the feet of a devotee and the remnants of food left by a devotee are three very powerful substances

948983 worshipers of shri gaurasundara accept the four syllables gau ra an ga as the gaura mantra but pure worshipers of radha and krishna accept the four syllables ra dha krs na as the gaura gopala mantra
948984 the hare krishna mahamantra considers the offenses whereas the names of gauranga nityananda dont consider offenses an offensive chanter will never achieve the fruit of chanting pure love for krishna by chanting the hare krishna mahamantra therefore till the time he is commiting offenses he should chant the names of nityananda and gauranga due the repeated chanting of the names of nityananda and gauranga the offenses will be destroyed and he will achieve the fruit of chanting
948985 the name of krishna and gauranga both are non different than the named lord those who think that krishna is any way inferior or limited than gauranga are in gross ignorance but in practical considerations with respect to benefit awarded to the conditioned souls the chanting of shri nityananda and gaurangas name is more useful and helpful for everyone the mercy of krishnas names is generally only upon liberated or perfected souls who are surrendered to him but the magnanimity of the names of lord nityananda and gauranga is especially for the souls who are offenders and full of anarthas and desires for material sense gratification the chanting of lord nityananda and lord gaurangas names and their worship quickly delivers the soul from all the offenses and thus the soul achieves shelter at the lotus feet of lord gauranga krishna without any delay
948986 simply by chanting or hearing the name of lord nityananda the sinful inclinations in the hearts of all the living entities in the universe are permanently destroyed and their inherent purity is automatically awakened on chanting or hearing the name of lord nityananda even the merchants degraded fallen and foolish people are purified and immediately become realized in the absolute truth and devotees of the lord

949003 virtualization is already widely used but primarily for the first order benefit namely server consolidation
949004 the second order benefits of agility availability and manageability of the it stack are now becoming better understood
949005 and as a consequence virtualization has moved from a tactical tool for gaining immediate savings to become a key strategic theme for every it department

949027 to pick a latino non native who works on early texas history is a very positive sign
949028 its proof that state officials are capable of thinking broadly and diversely about the need to promote a vision for texas history that is beyond traditional themes and a narrow segment of the population
949029 the states early history is also the story of northeastern mexico
949030 latino children and all texans should appreciate just how closely we are tied to the history culture and demographics of mexico going back centuries
949031 by the same token the texas of today is a direct product of a social and economic transformation that took place in the 20th century
949032 the story of the 19th century may be romantic and nationalistic but it does not give students a sense of why texas is the way it is today
949033 in that time i had to learn a lot of texas history
949034 that led me to write my dissertation on spanish san antonio before i finished writing it i got a job as an archivist at the texas general land office there i had to deal with texas history on a day in day out basis and my fascination with the subject was cemented ive been doing texas history ever since
949035 i believe that textbook sets out a way of understanding the importance of texass early story to all texans
949036 it ties the more distant past to the present and reminds us of the vastness of the story of texas to the degree that those who read crossroads come away with a better understanding of why and how texas developed the way it did up to the arrival of anglo american settlers and helps make what happened in the 19th century more meaningful i will have done my job
949037 ill have an opportunity to shape how the position is perceived by the general public

949053 i just find the jews gullibility ridiculous they put you in these torture camps and then tell you you get to go take a shower and you just do it what the fuck
949054 i know you guys outnumbered the nazis by far and youre so freaking docile you didnt even try to over power us
949055 um what the jews were told to go shower yes but the guards also had guns that could shoot about 100 bullets per second and there were probably 10 guards for 30 people whats the math on that
949056 the jewish people ought to be exterminated root and branch then the plague of pests would have disappeared in poland at one stroke
949057 i ask nothing of the jews except that they should disappear
949058 now judgment has begun and it will reach its conclusion only when knowledge of the jews has been erased from the earth
949059 never before has there been a greater challenge to life liberty and civilization
949060 gentlemen i must ask you to rid yourselves of all feeling of pity we must annihilate the jews wherever we find them and wherever it is possible in order to maintain there the structure of the reich as a whole

949067 its familiar but completely new as well were pretty excited
949068 i recall brian mentioning that he had a lot of largely instrumental tracks hed accumulated and since in his words he hates writing words i suggested i have a go at writing some words and tunes over a few of them and we see what happens
949069 when we started this work we started to think we were making something like electronic gospel a music where singing was the central event but whose sonic landscapes were not the type normally associated with that way of singing this thought tapped into my long love affair with gospel music which curiously was inadvertently initiated by david and the talking heads
949070 the live shows will maybe try to draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30 years ago a little bit anyway
949071 this record started life as a dinner conversation i was in new york having dinner with david and some other friends and happened to mention that i had a lot of music which i had intended to make into songs but never succeeded with
949072 when we started this work we started to think we were making something like electronic gospel a music where singing was the central event but whose sonic landscapes were not the type normally associated with that way of singing
949073 the first gospel song i ever really responded to surrender to his will by reverend maceo woods and the christian tabernacle choir was one i heard on a distant southern american radio station whilst in compass point nassau working with talking heads on the album
949074 as a foreigner in new york which was where i ended up living shortly after
949075 i want the music to be inviting to offer you a place inside it i think david responded to this with sensitivity and skill and his natural edginess made those familiar progressions sound new to me
949076 a couple of years ago i passed through london and having reconnected with brian eno when our
949077 brian sent me a cd with some instrumental tracks stereo rough mixes a bit later and i listened to them on and off trying to get a sense of what kind of story this music was trying to tell
949078 i eventually wrote back to brian after living with some of his music for almost a year and said i got a sort of folk electronic gospel feeling from his tracks and suggested that my lyrics and melodies might reflect that and did that direction seem ok
949079 i attacked the first one which i think was called and suddenly on brians track list id just finished reading dave eggers book

949095 some were against the idea of selling the water on the free market others said lets get paid for the water farmers always felt it belonged to them
949096 because of personal greed people have picked off this county and some stubborn farmers are standing in the way
949097 i dont think theres any question you have to do a water transfer
949098 the imperial valley is the best place to farm anywhere because of our water rights
949099 i want to be a farmer this is not a sell out its not going to happen
949100 i feel much more comfortable having iid represent the public as a whole than having our future in the hands of the farmers it seems to me that iid is working at budgeting the water that is being alloted to us through the colorado river for the best of all valley residents not just a select few so the farmers want all the water alloted to their gates regardless if they need it or not sounds greedy to me water is a natural resource that is to benefit mankind not a select few the situation is not the same as when the first agreements were written up we now have limited resources because of the droughts plus the population is higher in the valley the whole world is changing we also need water to bring in industries which will in turn bring in jobs giving the rights to farmers just because they feel theyre entitled to that is dangerous because it would create a control over the valley that might not be to the benefit of our future
949101 the farmers feel the valley and its wea th belongs to them gt iid supplies the farmers with the cheapest water in california the electric ratepayers money is directed to the farmers through corrupt accounting practices the elcetric buys vehicles and equipment the water is given ownership and rents it to the electric side at a great profit but this relationship is not enough for the farmers they want more the farmers had sued to stop non farmers from being iid directors they lost i was in the company of a farmer 2 years ago who was visably upset that non farmers were participating in the 2006 election the farmers became mad that the late dr bogue had hosted govenor nominee bustamenta at a fundraiser and retaliated by sending thier workers to another doctor they want another farmer on the iid board mike cox that would make it three farmers and hanks brother is an agriculture businessman the imperial group to make millions only need to decieve the valleyites into giving them iid the judges werent stupid enough to agree with them they hope the valleyites are stupid and dumb
949102 unfortunately to the wealthy land owners of imperial county we live in a democracy in the united states of america not a monarchy one person one vote
949103 im not from here and i dont go to the stockmans club or barbara worth to play a few rounds of golf with my local influential friends but as an outsider looking in it always appeared

949109 now that we can do something useful for people who are infected testing the people most likely to be infected is beginning to make sense could it lead to people being outed being stigmatized yes but untreated aids has a way of outing people anyway so you get the stigma and the avoidably early death

949148 you have this leverage unique leverage with khartoum will you please use it for two things to persuade khartoum to cease the ongoing aerial attacks and ground bombardments and to admit the peacekeepers as obliged one year ago

949208 we also found that in the presence of sexist humor participants believed the other participants would approve of the funding cuts to womens organizations we believe this shows that humorous disparagement creates the perception of a shared standard of tolerance of discrimination that may guide behavior when people believe others feel the same way

949281 b sicamente lo que intenta es armar una comisi n que va a estar presidida por la gobernadora y los intendentes
949282 se habr hecho mucho poco o nada pero del punto de visto t cnico las reas responsables han hecho lo que ten an que hacer y fundamentalmente lo que ac falta es dinero para obras de infraestructura b sica
949283 no se pueden adjudicar porque no tienen los servicios de agua y cloacas
949284 obras sanitarias necesita hacer infraestructura por 319 millones de pesos que no van a demorar menos de dos a os
949285 porque la modificaci n a la ley tarifaria crea un fondo social y de ese fondo hay ya un 10 que se destina para este tipo de obras
949286 no se trabaj en forma coordinada entre los propios organismos de gobierno menos con los municipios
949287 hay gente que est en un estado de vulnerabilidad social
949288 graciela ramaciotti de finis terrae dice que estamos de alguna manera avalando las usurpaciones pero esto desde ya no es el objetivo
949289 entendemos que hay gente que est en un estado de vulnerabilidad y a estas personas decimos que se las resguarde y que tanto el municipio como el gobierno haga las acciones legales para el desalojo el municipio solamente administrativamente puede hacer desarmes que es lo que viene haciendo hasta ahora pero b sicamente lo que se busca tambi n es crear un fondo en el que colaboren los municipios para poder concretar estas obras que se necesitan
949290 una herramienta importante para que se puedan obtener recursos a nivel nacional que de otra manera no se podr an obtener
949291 a que se respete la autonom a municipal y se empiece a trabajar en conjunto
949292 no digo que el intendente les va a tener que dar una soluci n habitacional y no respetar el listado que tiene para adjudicar terrenos puede ser un lugar de tr nsito y espera eso lo determinar la autoridad
949293 el intendente tiene todas las herramientas para hacer los desarmes por la v a administrativa y los desalojos por la v a judicial una cosa es el desarme de una estructura que no est habitada y otra el desalojo
949294 porque la modificaci n a la ley tarifaria crea un fondo social y de ese fondo hay ya un 10 que se destina para este tipo de obras

949303 ninguno de los miembros del congreso puede ser acusado interrogado judicialmente ni molestado por las opiniones o discursos que emita desempe ando su mandato de legislador
949304 con respecto a la primera observaci n efectuada por el convencional augsburger debo decir que obviamente la tipificaci n como calumnias e injurias de determinadas manifestaciones nicamente puede quedar librada a la decisi n judicial
949305 as que en este aspecto lejos estamos de entender que a un legislador se lo puede sospechar de estar incurso en estos dos delitos sin la intervenci n del poder judicial
949306 con esto estamos tambi n de alguna forma diferenciando la inmunidad de la impunidad
949307 de esta forma resulta clara la intencionalidad de los constituyentes provinciales respecto de la soluci n dada ante las manifestaciones de un legislador provincial donde condicionan procesalmente la decisi n a un examen judicial de la presencia o no del delito contra el honor como el que aqu se eval a
949308 los precedentes nacionales del m s alto tribunal de justicia en ese sentido
949309 es determinar en el caso que nos ocupa el verdadero alcance de la normativa constitucional provincial que no es anular el privilegio en ciernes

949357 shame on you irina what do you think youre doing wheres your yiddishkeit and where the heck is your sense of common human decency you made a promise and the person is relying on you being there if you didnt feel like going you should have said that you cant make it but now someone is counting on your support so youd better show up whether you like it or not what a fine way to start out for a young lawyer by breaking promises to your fellow students what next its just like that horrible essay you read for your professional responsibility class where this cynical old lawyer sarcastically writes that most unethical lawyers dont start out being unethical in fact they start out just like you are but then they are tempted into padding their billable hours out of convenience and go down slippery slope of lies and cheating coming up with justifications for their actions every time perhaps no one ever finds out and perhaps they do but they successfully lie themselves and thus become worse and worse over time and thats where youll wind up if you dont watch it no you cant do that just once out of convenience every action counts and in the long run this breaking of a promise will be your own indictment against you and no number of ethical actions and kept promises in the future will ever erase this one spot on your resume i cant believe i even have to tell you this come on snap out of it

949388 in the 70s the east german women started breaking all these records and they said its the suit and all the attention was on the suit and we know now that it wasnt the suit

949395 i will always be cuban and proud of my heritage but i had to follow my dream
949396 we will not expose a cuban team again to the excesses and provocations that in this case would occur in chicago in u s territory an ideal location for merchants and traffickers to act freely with the complicity of u s authorities
949397 i wouldnt say the cuban boxers are weak because even when they lose great fighters there are other ones coming up behind them but this team is not as experienced as theyve been before

949424 after realising that the power had gone and that we were keeping the action going on stage the audience stood up and joined in to clapping and dancing
949425 they had realised our predicament but just overlooked it and joined in a great gesture of togetherness in keeping the show going on

949450 at moment of great peril in the past century our leaders ensured that america by deed and by example led and lifted the world that we stood and fought for the freedom sought by billions of people beyond their borders
949451 why the facts of 9 11 must be suppressed understanding the ruling group mind behind the war without end
949452 that the official taguba report itself was not permitted to question anyone above a part time reserve army woman officer who was kept out of the interrogation room by u s defense intelligence was nowhere reported as evidence of top down control 3
949453 a continuous process of adapting facts to the ruling paradigm as opposed to adjusting the ruling paradigm to accommodate the facts
949454 no other cause than the 9 11 attack could have incited american legislators to sacrifice their constituents tax dollars in the long term trillions the lives of other americans and the reputation of america in the world as u s security geostrategists from both parties recognised beforehand without an attack on america unilateral armed force invasions of distant societies were wars that could not be sold after vietnam 9 11 reversed the tide of a generation beneath all the surface phenomena of party politics and competing media and opinions ruled the market religion of america for which the globe was its resource basin and labour pool its land of milk and honey of the promised land of three millennia later the historical subject now was the ruling market group mind and its commanding assumptions were the set points for every decision that the accumulating effects in the larger world of global market expansion beyond all barriers were the ozone layer shredding oceans rising and environmental indicators in precipitous decline could not register through the regulating framework of meaning 102 all that was externality to the ruling calculus conflicting interests of party class and ethnos merged as the propelling consensus of the life blind at the middle and working class levels we love america was the shared self image of citizens since patriotic americans all loved america and america was our men and women serving in our armed forces abroad they could no longer distinguish their beloved country from the crimes of the national security state the deployments of armed terror mass disinformation secret narco links and political bribery and coercion at every level were denied necessary anomalous or exceptions 103 the monstrous equations were assumed as america which must be defended against her enemies those who oppose america are anti american the victims are the enemy war crimes are collateral damages one absurd equation builds onto another as a paranoid mass cult called patriotism but all proceeds in accordance with the shadow subject of the ruling group mind it is certainly true that there are market class biases to the effects the resources of the poor are expropriated for transnational market profit and consumption while the u s treasury itself is structurally adjusted to a wide mouth siphon to the rich for market investment and growth but the class bias of the payoffs do not explain the all class affirmation of the silently deciding assumptions that select and exclude towards every decision trend and outcome only what fights back is perceived by the u s and the free world as a problem to be overcome and only military and market plans are selected for resolved collective action global trade edicts imf market restructuring and after 9 11 direct military invasions follow from the global market meta program the sole meanings of development defence and security which make sense to the regulating thought regime the geostrategic hinge on which all turns is 9 11 both the karmic blow back and the launching site of the war without end it is the unseen synecdoche of implosion of a life disconnected empire beyond its group mind rule opens the horizon of the life economy alternative

949474 whats damaging the mccain campaign now i suspect is that this fiercely independent man is trying to please other people especially a republican leadership that doesnt really trust him
949475 we should put in place an employment verification system and then when an employer is thinking of hiring someone the federal database immediately tells them whether theyre available to be working or not if theyre not you cant hire them people that are here illegally are going to have to get in line with everybody else with no special pathway to becoming citizens legal immigration is great but illegal immigration that weve got to end thank you and amnesty is not the way to do it
949476 why then do we bother to defend him when we believe hes being unfairly attacked first senate democrats and their msm helpers have no more right to level unfair charges against gonzales than they did against john roberts and sam alito notwithstanding the greater merit of these two men a smear is a smear second its important and clearly legitimate to expose smears by the likes of leahy schumer and feingold and in this case unfortunately specter in order to diminish their credibility when it comes to future battles in which they engage in similar conduct

949482 whats unclear is where they intend to go from here if they get the chance to lead the country many opponents of the war take it as a given that if the democrats take the white house an immediate pullout of u s troops would commence how can anyone be certain what would happen under a democratic regime when democrats themselves dont seem to know from day to day this is a party that has since the war began tried to have it both ways
949483 the democrats have not elected congressional majorities in 12 years and theyve occupied the white house in only eight of the last 26 years the lefts current unruliness seems a way of scapegoating others for a more elemental frustration that they cant gain a national majority based on their core beliefs more entitlements higher taxes to pay for them gay marriage de facto quotas in affirmative action open borders abortion on demand and radical secularism these liberal issues dont tend to resonate with most americans
949484 president bushs tax cuts were supposed to cause a cataract of red ink in fiscal 2006 however federal revenues as a share of gdp were 18 4 percent slightly above the post 1962 average of 18 2 and the federal budget deficit was 247 7 billion just 1 9 percent of the 13 1 trillion gdp that is below the average for the 1970s 2 1 1980s 3 0 and 1990s 2 2
949485 but now shouting leftists have lowered the bar the danger of course is that by emulating the rhetoric of a cindy sheehan or michael moore the feral democrats when they come back into power again as tamed leaders who must govern will have created frankensteins and as we know such monsters always turn on their creators
949486 in this century it has fallen to america to take center stage and let me acknowledge the debt the world owes to the united states for its leadership in this struggle america has shown by the resilience and bravery of its people from sept 11 2001 to this day that while buildings can be destroyed values are indestructible that while lives may be ended the belief in liberty never dies and that while hearts may be broken the faith in a better future is unbreakable

949495 making matters worse north korea has been fighting a famine since 1995 natural disasters such as annual floods account for some of the food shortages but most is due to failed agricultural and economic policies as a result as many as 2 5 million people out of a population of 22 million have died due to starvation disease over the last decade while accurate numbers are near impossible to come by today 7 percent are believed to be starving and 37 percent chronically malnourished reports freedom house even more tragic many children born during the famine have been orphaned and suffer from mental physical handicaps due to severe malnutrition early in life defectors report cases of cannibalism
949496 some republicans on capitol hill are bracing for losses of 25 house seats or more but party operatives say rove is predicting that at worst republicans will lose only 8 to 10 seats shy of the 15 seat threshold that would cede control to democrats for the first time since the 1994 elections and probably hobble the balance of bushs second term
949497 while voter approval of congress has plunged to 32 percent in the wake of the lobbying and congressional page scandals a washington post abc news poll of voters last week found that at least 60 percent liked and supported their representatives
949498 the old adage that voters hate congress but love their congressman continues to ring true incumbents are hard to beat

949540 i take each olympic cycle as a goal in itself so i dont really think about the past the goal is to win gold in beijing
949541 he has an incredible ability to turn around a race that might not be going very well and get a decent result out of it
949542 if we lose a lot of days it does become a lottery
949543 but if we get a reasonable number of races then im confident that the talent will end up at the top of the list
949544 any olympic medal is an amazing achievement for sure because sailing is such a funny sport but id be disappointed if i didnt win as i would in any event because thats why you do sport to try to win
949545 the more you go to the olympics and the older and more experienced you get the easier it becomes in terms of putting all the razzmatazz aside so you can focus on the racing if i win then fantastic and it will be nice to say ive got three gold medals but until that happens you cant really think about it
949546 it isnt an exaggeration to say he is possibly the greatest ever dinghy sailor
949547 in the build up to the international year of biodiversity in 2010 we want politicians policy makers and ordinary people to begin to give agricultural biodiversity the attention and respect it deserves by 2010 we need politicians to be taking serious action to ensure that agricultural biodiversity can be a big part of the solution to the huge challenges we face today diversity for life the global campaign we are launching tonight will help them to do so
949548 this list of some of the events celebrating biodiversity and agriculture day is a great demonstration of the importance of agricultural biodiversity
949549 of course agrobiodiversity is important for breeding but its scope goes much further agricultural biodiversity also delivers better nutrition and health it makes harvests more sustainable and minimizes the risk of failure it offers income earning opportunities and is especially valuable to the poorest people on the most marginal lands it confers greater sustainability on farming systems and in the medium term it will be absolutely essential to cope with climate change thats a pretty important list
949550 this will enhance genebank management in malaysia it will also complement the establishment of mardis new genebank set to be completed in 2010 at serdang malaysia and create opportunities to gain new information in addition to what is currently being practiced in the country
949551 it is indeed an opportune moment for bioversity international and rda to forge closer ties with partners through programmes like these which greatly enhance the conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources
949552 we value rdas important regional collaboration by offering in depth tailor made training genebank managers in the region will be enabled to manage and use their collections to address pressing needs for greater food security
949553 while there was a lot that governments could not agree on such as trade agreements and biofuels two things were mentioned in almost every statement the need for humanitarian aid and the need to invest more in agricultural research and development
949554 thats excellent but we also need to see money to match the rhetoric of more research and development otherwise when the food crisis reoccurs as it will it will be even worse than this time
949555 urge s the international community including the private sector to decisively step up investment in science and technology for food and agriculture
949556 dr borlaug has written several letters to the administration asking them to reconsider the decision to cut funding
949557 i hope that with all the promises made here in rome they will now reconsider
949558 access to appropriate locally adapted seeds fertilizers animal feed and other inputs to increase agricultural production
949559 with donor support cgiar centres can certainly provide the seeds technology and know how that partners can then use to help farmers increase their harvests
949560 it is essential to address the fundamental question of how to increase the resilience of present food production systems to challenges posed by climate change
949561 the declaration says that maintaining biodiversity is key to sustaining future production performance id go further than that we need to make much greater use of agricultural biodiversity now
949562 the farming systems of poor people in marginal lands can become more productive and more resilient in the face of external pressures and not just those of climate change that will take research and to do that will take additional investment
949563 culture depends on agriculture which gave people the leisure to develop art philosophy science and all the other activities we take for granted in a civilized society
949564 although that is certainly important agricultural biodiversity also delivers better nutrition and health it makes harvests more sustainable and minimizes the risk of failure it offers income earning opportunities and is especially valuable to the poorest people on the most marginal lands it confers greater sustainability on farming systems and in the medium term it will be absolutely essential to cope with climate change thats a pretty important list
949565 there is more to this than science and philosophy we also want to celebrate the human diversity and culture that springs from agricultural riches
949566 im thrilled that the orchestra di piazza vittorio has agreed to play for us they are a living embodiment of everything the campaign is about diversity culture and celebration
949567 because the golden rule for healthy living is to eat little but to eat the greatest diversity possible
949568 there is a very serious message in all of this
949569 in the build up to the international year of biodiversity in 2010 we want politicians policy makers and ordinary people to begin to give agricultural biodiversity the attention and respect it deserves it is quite literally the basis of future human prosperity and survival and with all the challenges pressing down on us we continue to ignore it at our peril
949570 we are very pleased to be able to offer the course again thanks to the sustained and strong support from nbpgr and india
949571 hands on experience the tips dos and donts were valuable
949572 it had a very high technical and scientific standard it far exceeded my expectations
949573 lectures and practicals were very good very well planned and delivered
949574 no time was lost on very basic things that all the students already knew
949575 armed me with enhanced skill and knowledge which i have applied in solving related problems in my home institution as well as in my on going phd research programme
949576 i do urge anyone with an interest to apply for the course
949577 the new revolution in sustainable agriculture was essentially put on hold
949578 thats one of the reasons were facing a food price crisis now
949579 it also helps explain why were not better prepared to confront the impacts of climate change in agriculture farmers would be much further along in adapting to those impacts if more of them had the resilient varieties now available and if more were using improved practices for managing natural resources including biodiversity soils water and small scale fisheries
949580 we urgently need to accelerate the flow of new varieties tolerant to heat drought and other stresses that will become worse with climate change
949581 we must also spread more widely the new tools and methods from research on natural resource management but there are no simple solutions and no magic bullets
949582 success will require a substantial increase in funding and collective action among all key actors and players
949583 we believe that in order to deliver the knowledge and technologies required we must double our annual investment in pro poor research

949592 the home office do not influence the content of these programmes after they are commissioned and they adhere to ofcoms strict guidelines on this kind of programme
949593 we had very good signs which was the presidential election on 21 may and then the nomination of the prime minister
949594 and we said to ourselves we are going to make the baalbek festival so that everybody knows that lebanon is all right because once the festival of baalbek goes on this means we are in good shape
949595 we are facing financial competition from the gulf for the pop artists the pop artists are asking really terrible amounts of money but nobody could give them the setting that the baalbek festival provides
949596 the very least we can benefit from these festivals is to see the name of baalbek in the media
949597 for us baalbek is a symbol of culture of history the programme was not quite what we were expecting because we used to come here to see fairuz and the big celebrities
949598 but the festival is a symbol of life and that is why we are happy to be here now it gives us hope to deal with the problems in lebanon

949611 the struggle in the country is now turning from a sectarian to an ethnic one due to the kurdish behavior which poses a danger on the country
949612 there are efforts and wishes to end this crisis but they always fail due to the obstinacy of the kurdish parties that want to annex kirkuk at any price
949613 i hope they can reach a solution that fits all parties and prevents the situation from deteriorating further
949614 the mistakes of politicians brought us to this stage our social fabric was torn up in kirkuk and this is very dangerous for all of iraq
949615 the board of imperial confirms that it has received another approach in relation to a possible cash offer for the company

949617 the names we choose matter when we name our children or name a public school or name a public park or courthouse we are signaling what is important to us once names are given there is an opportunity for people to learn about the values those names represent and promote those values in the world with brian kisida and jonathan butcher i have already analyzed we found a trend away from naming schools after people in general and presidents in particular instead schools are increasingly receiving names that sound more like herbal teas or day spas whispering winds hawks bluff desert mesa etc we found that there are more public schools in florida named after manatees than george washington now i am turning my attention to school mascots i understand that mascot names arent taken very seriously and are often chosen without much deliberation or care but even something trivial like what we name our pets or the mascot names we adopt says something about us besides this is a bit of fun

949645 it is clear whitehall bureaucrats are instructing town halls to target householders with fines for minor breaches
949646 yet with the slow death of weekly collections and shrinking bins it is increasingly hard for families to dispose of their rubbish responsibly it is fundamentally unfair that householders are now getting hammered with larger fines than shoplifters get for stealing
949647 local authorities wanted flexible fines that they can relate to the severity and frequency of the offence and offender ultimately the fines are there to act as a deterrent

949679 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

949683 in a flash realising the situation the percussionists and the drummers who needed no power kept the beat going on
949684 after realising that the power had gone and that we were keeping the action going on stage the audience stood up and joined in to clapping and dancing
949685 they had realised our predicament but just overlooked it and joined in a great gesture of togetherness in keeping the show going on

949711 mit alexander solschenizyn ist nicht nur einer der gr ten schriftsteller unserer zeit sondern auch ein herausragender vork mpfer f r die wahrheit von uns gegangen
949712 er war ein unbeugsamer seinen einsatz f r freiheit und gerechtigkeit hat er zuerst in den straflagern stalins und dann durch ein jahrzehntelanges exil bezahlt werke wie ein tag im leben des iwan denissowitsch und archipel gulag haben ihren festen platz im ged chtnis der menschheit sie sind weltliteratur und dokumentieren zugleich in einzigartiger weise die verbrechen des stalinismus an menschen und politik
949713 solschenizyn war auch ein vorbote jener grundlegenden ver nderungen die russland am ende des 20 jahrhunderts erlebt hat sein werk bietet zugleich die beste garantie dass das dunkle erbe der stalinistischen diktatur weder vergessen noch relativiert werden kann wie das heute gelegentlich bedauerlicherweise versucht wird
949714 alexander solschenizyn wird uns auch durch seine unbeirrbare liebe zu seiner russischen heimat sowie zu deren gro er geschichte und einzigartiger kultur in erinnerung bleiben er hat durch sein ganzes lebenswerk bewiesen dass patriotismus und die bereitschaft sich mit den schattenseiten der eigenen geschichte auseinander zu setzen keinen widerspruch darstellen sie bilden vielmehr ein gemeinsames und oft schmerzhaftes ganzes solschenizyn hat gezeigt dass man den weg in die zukunft nur dann wirklich beschreiten kann wenn man sich ehrlich mit der eigenen vergangenheit auseinander setzt diese bleibende botschaft verdient es gerade auch heute weit ber seine russische heimat hinaus geh rt zu werden

949723 den weltfrieden und die internationale sicherheit zu wahren ist das ziel der vereinten nationen die uno versteht heute unter sicherheit allerdings viel mehr als einen zustand ohne konflikte und waffengewalt auch entwicklung menschenrechte und schutz vor umweltrisiken sind wichtige voraussetzungen f r sicherheit und dauerhaften frieden in diesem sinne weist die friedenssicherung heute viele facetten auf

949725 theorie und praxis klaffen oft nicht weit auseinander konferenzen wie diese geben daher nicht nur einen guten einblick in die abl ufe und das funktionieren der vereinten nationen sie stellen auch eine interessante m glichkeit dar einen einblick in die multilaterale diplomatie zu gewinnen die eigenen verhandlungsf higkeiten zu verbessern sowie die eigene pers nlichkeit zu sch rfen

949759 i havent heard anything from any of my neighbours yet but im not expecting any complaints hes just so awe inspiring i shouldnt think there would be many gorillas on royal terrace
949760 most of what is in the exhibition comes from private houses but a couple of artists have put in private works
949761 weve got everything from cameretta through the colourists right up to tracey emin its very eclectic
949762 parents who have two children there in particular will be really really pushed
949763 parents are now faced with having to disrupt their childs nursery provision in order to find more affordable care
949764 i know of one family for which this has already proven to be the case i think we were informed too late they made this decision back in february but didnt tell us until a point where we had no choice
949765 to me it seems like privatising a local council service
949766 i dont think we are doing the private nursery sector out of business but why should that be the first concern
949767 labours big idea is to try to provide affordable care for families the idea that this local authority is putting up fees to be the same as the private sector is outrageous
949768 cowgate under 5s centre is a subsidised service and this increase in the fees will bring it into line with similar facilities in the private sector
949769 there has been a quite dramatic fall in heart disease in the last few years the problem is with the future generation
949770 the risk is the reduction in heart attacks we have experienced in recent years will actually go back up again
949771 that will have an impact on individuals levels of ill health on increased health service costs and increased disability
949772 weve definitely seen a drop less people are having heart attacks and those that do are more likely to survive them
949773 but there certainly is this timebomb building up because of obesity and everything else that goes with it such as not getting a lot of exercise not eating fast food
949774 i doubt it incidents of heart disease will get back to the levels it was at when smoking was more common that was such a major factor and it has definitely tailed off the smoking ban has helped a lot
949775 coronary heart disease and stroke remain two of scotlands biggest killers
949776 i welcome the progress that has been made but theres no doubt that we need a long term action plan to further drive down rates of chd and stroke
949777 this government is already taking bold action to cut levels of obesity smoking and alcohol misuse which all contribute to chd and stroke prevalence
949778 as well as taking into account preventative measures like encouraging healthy lifestyles we want to eradicate as far as possible the health inequalities that still exist and ensure that patients receive the best quality of care
949779 and through our health action plan better health better care were committed to providing patients with the best possible treatment and care
949780 this consultation seeks to gather a range of views on how we can further improve services and make them more responsive to patient needs and wishes
949781 we will then draw on these to produce an action plan that will form the core of the revised strategy which well publish before the end of this year

949783 we are keen to see common sense and common courtesy prevail and do not understand how lothian buses reaches the conclusion that the dda requires a total ban on prams being taken on the bus
949784 i dont think anyone in a wheelchair wants people thrown off buses for them it should be left up to the drivers discretion
949785 i am worried this is being framed as a wheelchair users versus mothers battle and it is not like that
949786 the public service vehicle accessibility regulations 2000 psvar requires new full size buses to be wheelchair accessible this means that there needs to be a designated wheelchair space
949787 it is acceptable for this space to be used by other passengers when it is not required by a wheelchair user but it should be vacated if at all possible when a wheelchair user requires it
949788 i think the majority of people would agree with ecas on this it just needs a bit of common sense
949789 the number of prams and wheelchair users on the buses compared to how many services there are must be tiny
949790 i dont see why they are making such a fuss
949791 the worry now is that if you have some drivers letting you on the bus on your way into town but you might not get back home
949792 in order to ensure that as far as possible wheelchairs can be accommodated on our vehicles we are unable to carry prams as they cannot be folded
949793 we can however carry one unfolded buggy if the wheelchair space is unoccupied
949794 we are well aware that we have no legal right to enforce non co operation of a drivers request to vacate wheelchair spaces
949795 however our conditions of carriage require other occupants to vacate the space if needed by the wheelchair user
949796 i think the issue for developers is theyre really being hit from all quarters
949797 costs have been going up for some time and many will have bought sites with estimated building costs and will now be facing much higher building costs
949798 yields have moved as well and the straw that broke the camels back now is that companies are not able to get the lending from the banks
949799 i think there will be many other companies in the same position
949800 the best buildings in the best locations will still be able to attract funding but it is slightly different for those in other areas
949801 i would think that debt funding is very difficult without some form of pre let
949802 were back to where we were 17 years ago theres a lack of liquidity from the banks now
949803 at least 17 years ago there was liquidity but there is a banking crisis in terms of funding development work
949804 there is no potential at all for caltongate to fall it has been four years in the making and subject to planning legislation for three years
949805 we have worked hard to make sure it is right for the city
949806 that would be the police i have to get that hang on
949807 yeah hi im these guys klutzy 31 year old daughter whose totally faded boyfriend opened the back door before i could punch in the code how do we turn this thing off yeah dont send the l a p d everythings fine
949808 conoc a a la chica de verla por el barrio paseando con un cr o peque o la pareja era joven y no se relacionaba mucho con los vecinos no sab a que hubiera problemas entre ellos
949809 er so im a long chain of atoms bonded to one another
949810 plastic copper you fink you are police but you aint
949811 it takes years of training and experience to produce a real copper but a support officer can be let loose in five minutes
949812 they work office hours patrol in groups for self protection and have about as much authority as scarecrows once troublemakers learn to ignore them
949813 its bad enough that street violence has turned our town centres into no go areas at night now we are expected to take instructions from a bunch of gormless shavers who wouldnt even know where to find their pencil and notebook
949814 i would be very unhappy about the installation of telephones
949815 i am surprised from a security point of view that there should be this easy access to phones many a drug dealer has been able to maintain his trade by telephone and this has to be guarded against
949816 the new modern accommodation at edinburgh prison will have full hygiene facilities no decision on the full in cell specifications has been made
949817 it must have cost a fair bit for them to do this because it wasnt just posted through the door it was actually sent in the post
949818 theyre really well done in the shape of a bin then you lift the lid off to reveal information that weve all known for years that our bins will be collected on a friday as they always are
949819 i phoned the council to let them know and they were a bit surprised this had happened
949820 leaflet distribution for the council is done on a street by street basis we therefore have to deliver to whole streets including those whose collection days will be staying the same as before
949821 i hope the residents of calder road are able to cope with and adjust to this drastic change of service
949822 it is unfortunate if the communications exercise hasnt been as good as it should be but the council does have to communicate these things to the public
949823 lauriston place church is a prominent victorian building which has sadly been allowed to fall into disrepair by the owners
949824 the council has made many efforts to halt its decline and it is essential that any further deterioration is stopped as soon as possible
949825 it is beginning to become an eyesore and this is made worse by the fact it occupies such a high profile location
949826 it is good if we as a council can do something pro active like this to try and move the situation on and find some sort of positive outcome for the building
949827 this building is a fairly significant structure of its time and we are obviously concerned at its neglect in recent years
949828 bushes grow and grass grows every year so it shouldnt be a surprise that paths need cut back
949829 its doubly important right now because the use of these paths is growing both with cyclists and pedestrians
949830 its inconvenient if the paths are overgrown but also risks unnecessary conflict between pedestrians and cyclists trying to pass each other
949831 this should be treated in the same way that the council would cut back vegetation overhanging a road or bus lane
949832 cleaned and cut back by the task force as and when they have any spare capacity
949833 a constituent raised concerns with me and said the paths were becoming difficult to use
949834 i assumed that if i reported this the work would be carried out but the response i received was unsatisfactory
949835 the council needs to ensure that cyclists and pedestrians have accessible and clean paths
949836 its never been this bad you have to duck to avoid the hedges and theres a lot of metal poking out from the sides
949837 they only need to tend it once year im not a gardener but i dont think thats too much to ask
949838 we thought a while ago we wanted to raise money for the teenage cancer trust but we wanted to do something different that would inspire people to sponsor us something a bit out of the box
949839 were both into water sports but were not seasoned kayakers by any means yet we thought it would be a good idea to kayak across the irish sea
949840 out in the sea youre only one wee boat and a big wave can knock you over if you capsize its a lot harder to get back in the boat
949841 the fact that were doing it in two boats should work to our advantage as the other person can carry out a rescue if something happens
949842 its still over a week until we sail so the weather forecast will never be too accurate but were expecting to have a headwind of around force two or three heading over which is going to be tough
949843 we wont be able to make it there and back in a single day so we will be staying in ireland overnight but by the time were ready to sail back the headwind will become a tailwind
949844 were hoping to break some speed records on the way back
949845 were absolutely thrilled theyre doing this in support of the trust
949846 angus and gordon used to have great fun together doing water sports up at loch ard
949847 cancer is a tough thing for anyone to go through but teenagers have their own unique problems
949848 gordon was diagnosed when he was 15 and at that age you want to be independent but you suddenly find yourself dependent on a whole host of people
949849 theres very little support because you dont find a great deal of affinity in either adult or childrens wards
949850 its imperative we find a committed ward for teenagers to help them cope with their illness
949851 any further presentation by the jump group to the planning committee would only serve to reiterate some of the various key issues and to re emphasise the magnitude of the proposed development and the great missed opportunity for leith the edinburgh waterfront and the city of edinburgh generally if permission is granted
949852 ive marched a straight or not so straight 1 400 miles
949853 it was always an effort to keep up a marathon every day for a week off road and with a pack on my back i always enjoyed finishing
949854 the gurkhas have always been popular in scotland and edinburgh has always been especially generous
949855 the 23 per week pension the trust pays may not seem much but it can be the difference between survival and utter destitution these are our oldest and best allies
949856 ive been wrestling with this for a number of years
949857 it was in a storeroom that the attack on a female worker took place
949858 mr self importance the ring leader gave the signal and the men grabbed the woman and lifted her onto the table on her back
949859 though she struggled a bit it seemed to me to be more of a lark than a lynching and she didnt cry out for help
949860 i took hold of her ankles and lifted her legs onto the table mr self importance then groped her it was all over
949861 weve taken what most people would consider basic medical supplies but theyre luxuries for doctors things like medication for diabetes heart conditions and antibiotics
949862 a lot of msps have been very supportive but to have the first ministers support should hopefully resolve the issue
949863 we will be writing to the egyptian and israeli ambassadors to ask them to allow this humanitarian aid into gaza

949865 this research highlights what we have known for some time that telemedicine can have a significant impact on stroke recovery
949866 facial weakness difficulty in raising both arms and speech problems are all symptoms of stroke so if you suspect a stroke you must act fast and call 999
949867 the proposed residential use is acceptable in this location but notwithstanding the quality of the architecture the design scale and loss of trees has an adverse impact on the conservation area the setting of the listed buildings and the world heritage site
949868 i am so proud of paul and what he has done for all residents and staff at our care home
949869 he brings that special touch to residents lives and goes beyond his duties to make drummond grange care home a special place to live
949870 we are all so proud that he has won this special award
949871 everyone in here staff and residents alike are absolutely delighted for me
949872 you lead the class and ill take your places ill interrupt just the way you do
949873 reliable air transportation for both cargo and civilians is a critical component of developing helmand provinces economy
949874 it was freezing and we had a laugh but it wouldnt be funny if someone had died
949875 halfway to the shore we lost an oar so the boat was drifting but we didnt really mind then we realised it had sprung a leak and water was coming in fast it sank about three quarters of the way over and we all ended up in the water
949876 the icon will be available in all handsets and hence will remain inactive if the consumer is not using an airtel connection it then also serves as a huge branding tool
949877 the central bank may approve the deal if the selldown rule is extended to five years from the current two years as the deal would be earnings accretive by then
949878 our findings raise the possibility that the physical symptoms of depression are particularly toxic to the cardiovascular system
949879 identifying the most harmful aspect of depression is important because we will then know which specific components to target with our treatments
949880 our study is important because it is the first to simultaneously examine the links between all of these negative emotions and sub clinical atherosclerosis
949881 in addition we broke depression down into physical and cognitive emotion symptom clusters which is uncommon
949882 no secondary prevention trial has successfully reduced cardiovascular risk by targeting depression
949883 there currently exists no evidence that treating depression will help prevent heart disease
949884 the biggest reason is that studies that would be needed to draw that conclusion would have to be large and therefore very expensive
949885 hopefully an added bonus will be to reduce the risk of developing or suffering from heart disease
949886 ultimately we plan to use the data from this study and similar investigations to develop a psychological treatment for adults at risk for cardiovascular disease
949887 we hope that our treatment when combined with standard treatments will help to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease
949888 we are rising far and above any other region in this country in recruiting and creating afghan police officers in the quest to win the fight against the enemies of afghanistan without a doubt we have the toughest area of operations were in the most volatile region in this country and we are progressing the most
949889 it is quite evident that the afghan women want to joint thee counterinsurgency fight against the enemies of afghanistan as much as the afghan men do
949890 in our desire to maximize the number of trained anp in the southern region we are increased our base of trained anp
949891 our innovative and aggressive approach towards training in the south is contributing to the safety security and long term progress of the afghan nation
949892 adding an extra two hundred plus fdd trained anp to the communities is well worth the effort
949893 weve come a long in way in a short amount of time in training the anp and our hard work is paying off as we watch the anp work effectively as a disciplined professional fighting force in their districts
949894 therefore with heavy hearts but mindful of our responsibilities with regard to wrongful trading the board of wrapit plc set the insolvency wheels in motion
949895 hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money and as things stand they will not take it
949896 over the next fortnight the situation should become a lot clearer
949897 esto siempre me ocurrir no saco nada con volver a andar en bicicleta
949898 anything that promotes citizenship and self esteem is a good thing but if it targets only muslims it could make other communities feel rightfully resentful
949899 good citizenship is important to us all we have to educate the wider society
949900 my concern is that when you single out communities you reinforce the problems rather than address them
949901 we need a holistic approach which all communities need to embrace
949902 its good to open new dialogue ending misunderstanding about the religion and extremism
949903 as british muslims we respect the rights and liberties we are offered islam does not teach what happened in london 7 7 bombings
949904 those people called themselves muslims but islam does not allow what they did
949905 i really hope that on 15 march people will join the demonstration in trafalgar square at 12 to march against the war and march against the continued occupation which has come from this war it had a rotten basis and nothing good will come of it

949907 we are working against the clock not just politically but out there in the real world because every year that passes we get more invasions and those invasions stay forever
949908 by the time the ship finally makes it into shore most of what you got rid of will have regrown
949909 you dont know what new or additional invasive species youll pick up
949910 there is no doubt that ballast water legislation that stems the tide of invasive species entering our waters from ships needs to be passed immediately
949911 disappointed that we have not yet been able to move this bill out of the senate
949912 i think we can make this work and all i care about is the end result
949913 and im here for one reason ive got to protect the health of the people i represent

949916 campaigning is a vital part of the election process local residents need to know what we stand for and how we hope to represent them before they vote in may i didnt see many other parties braving the weather and meeting the residents of springfield as we did today and thats because i believe we have a commitment to raise their concerns and make their voice heard by the council
949917 i hope they will choose to elect me as their representative so we can finally make a positive difference in the community
949918 campaigning was great as we met loads of nice people and we got a very good response

949927 if a lawyer can advise me on the ins and outs of these regulations then presumably someone has explained the ins and outs of these regulations to the lawyers can i speak to that person please
949928 if youre saying these regulations are open to interpretation then theoretically theres no real way to enforce them in a court one lawyer might argue i was acting within the law and another that i was breaking it and the outcome would literally be down to how the law was interpreted
949929 then how are they enforced does someone from the oft go around policing the internet checking for misleading forum posts or is it the responsibility of the forum owner or its users to prosecute those breaching the regulations
949930 you can be prosecuted yes but theres no information as to how its enforced
949931 a marketer posting positive reviews of their own business products or services on peer review websites could be in breach of the regulations communicating positive messages about a brand in a blog without making it clear that you work for the brand concerned or its agency could mean marketers fall foul of the regulations as could seeding viral adverts on the internet in a way that suggests they have been distributed by a member of the public

949943 ho imparato che non ha importanza quanto e come si ama tutti noi uomini e donne viviamo le nostre vite da soli non ha senso volersi appropriare di qualcuno e nonostante lo sappia a volte me ne dimentico ancora purtroppo non posso fare a meno di pensarci e mi sento cos sola e triste
949944 a quellepoca non ero in grado di amare nessuno in modo maturo ed equilibrato
949945 sai nana veder realizzati i propri sogni ed essere felici sono due cose completamente diverse questa contraddizione mi ancora incomprensibile
949946 il vero amore significa non pretendere niente e proteggere da lontano la donna amata ne sono sicuro e cos per una volta che ti innamori desideri avere tutto da una persona questa la natura umana
949947 shin uomini e donne sono schiavi del desiderio sessuale giusto tu pensi che tra loro possa esistere davvero lamore
949948 ti giuro che se vorrai diventare la mia donna io far limpossibile per renderti felice tu non mi conosci bene ma quando faccio una promessa la mantengo nana quando tu sei al mio fianco io posso fare limpossibile dopo che avrai rotto con takumi e avrai fatto luce nel tuo cuore corri subito da me io ti aspetter
949949 manda pure in frantumi le mie illusioni non ho paura tanto non saprei come fare a cancellare la tua immagine dal mio cuore
949950 ero molto pi fragile di quanto credevo pensavo che un uomo dovesse difendere la sua donna con le ragazze con cui uscivo mi comportavo da spaccone solo ora ho capito che mi sbagliavo nel momento stesso in cui mi sono innamorato di te ho realizzato che la mia virilit e equiparabile a quella di un castoro ma finch tu sarai al mio fianco posso fare limpossibile
949951 ho capito che sono veramente felice solo quando posso suonare la chitarra accompagnando te
949952 lei diversa da tutte le ragazze che conosco loro vogliono avere il mio corpo o addirittura il mio cuore invece lei gentile con me e non pretende niente in cambio questo fa percepire il vero affetto
949953 non preoccuparti lho fatto per avere la risposta alla domanda del secolo uomini e donne sono schiavi del desiderio sessuale non vero pensi che tra loro possa esistere lamore lamore quello che lega voi due giusto avete anche fatto sesso ma perch voi due siete innamorati quindi lamore pu esistere per qualcuno
949954 chi ti dice che non possa esistere anche per te
949955 gli esseri umani in fondo sono tutti soli e per quanto si avvicinino l uno all altra non potranno mai diventare una cosa unica so benissimo che irragionevole per a volte non posso fare a meno di pensare che sarebbe bello se nana fosse solamente mia cos almeno potrei infilarla nella tasca del chiodo e portarla fino a tokyo con me
949956 no non credo che ci entrerebbe forse sarebbe pi efficace provare a dirle senti tu vieni con me
949957 ti sei sempre presa troppo sul serio passavi le giornate a rimuginare eri triste a quanto pare anche hachiko ti vuole molto bene dovresti esserne felice trovo che i sentimenti che provi per lei siano davvero deliziosi la vostra proprio una bella amicizia
949958 la gente che mi sta intorno mi stressa di continuo dicendo non fare questo non fare quello che ti rovini limmagine ma io sono io non posso smettere si essere me stessa perch me lo ordinano
949959 dici davvero shin non lo sai il filo rosso quello a cui sono legate mignolo a mignolo le persone compagne nel destino io per non credo affatto a questo tipo di fatalismo sai come la penso che lunica cosa che pu legare due persone unite nel destino la fiducia reciproca
949960 scusa tanto nana adesso non venirmi a dire che non hai mai sentito parlare dellistinto maschile gli uomini fanno sesso quando ne hanno voglia a prescindere dai sentimenti
949961 ancora oggi non riesco a dimenticare ci che accadde quella sera nana cant la canzone di nobu ancora priva di testo aggiungendovi delle parole in un inglese senza senso e io divenni prigioniera di quella voce come se un misterioso incantesimo mi stesse avvolgendo nella sua spirale il tavolo come palcoscenico il cellulare come microfono e la luna crescente come riflettore lunica persona in grado di praticare questo tipo di incantesimo nana di questo sono convinta ancora oggi

949967 we think that there is essentially a bottleneck for information processing and if a certain type of stimulus captures attention it can basically jam up that bottleneck so subsequent information can t get through
949968 comparing sexual arousal between men and women we see that there is no difference in the amount of time it takes healthy young men and women to reach peak arousal

949973 saya harap pihak exco dan akar umbi akan menerima nasihat presiden abdullah parti tradisi dalam umno kita dengar cakap bos kita iaitu presiden dan ketua wanita
949974 saya tidak akan ingkar arahan ataupun nasihat daripada presiden dan saya percaya wanita umno akan akur akan nasihat itu
